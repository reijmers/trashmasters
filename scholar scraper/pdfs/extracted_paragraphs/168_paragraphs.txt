This article is about regional development based on the principles of circular economy  and the industrial symbiosis framework. Nowadays tremendous amount of solid waste from  household, industrial and agricultural materials accumulate in the territories of different  countries around whole world. Finland has experience in waste techno parks design and in the development of waste branch around the whole country. Finland has considered be one of the  leading country in Circular Economy and its government strategic goal is to be the leading  country in the world in Circular Economy until 2025. The Finnish experience shows that there  has to be close co-operation between companies, universities and authorities, but also common  goal and understanding.  The main questions: which are the elements that could be adapted from the Finnish Circular  Economy and the resource efficiency thinking, and how to implement ideas into other cultural  and industrial environments in Russia.  Our researchers together could discuss and decide which  are the key elements that can be used and which of them contradict to using industrial symbiosis  development in Russia.  1.  Introduction  The World Economic Forum report  has termed this period of accelerating innovation in science and  technology – the transformative change in data and technology capabilities combined with a merging of  digital, physical and biological realms and its consequences on society as the Fourth Industrial  Revolution. It is not only transforming social networks, scientific research and whole industries; it is  also radically reshaping biological and material science innovations. Harnessing these opportunities and  proactively managing the risks manifest by the rapid evolution of new science and technologies will  inevitably require more creativity and agility in current governance frameworks and financing  arrangements.   A crucial role in market evolution is happening by exploring how businesses can use the circular  economy to drive arbitrage opportunities across complex, global supply chains . A circular economy  is restorative and regenerative by design and aims to keep products, components, and materials at their  highest utility and value at all times. It questions whether with creativity and innovation we can build a restorative economy.  To be successful on new challenges of Industry 4.0 development, enterprise-university partnerships  has to be intense and main objective should be a shared learning  . Long-term co-operation creates a  background for new co-innovation and co- evolution. The technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution have generated enormous excitement about the opportunities they offer as well as concern  about governance, regulation and ethics .  Efficient waste treatment-2018 IOP Conf. Series: Earth and Environmental Science 337  012032IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1755-1315/337/1/012032 2            There are as well exciting possibilities: The convergence of new technologies is creating unprecedented  opportunities in all aspects, from business-to-business commerce to humanitarian intervention. The melding of  artificial intelligence  with big data capabilities – not to mention the actual exponential accumulation of data  itself – has created a fascinating world of communications, collaboration and interaction, not just between people  but also between machines and between people and machines. Through digital transformation, the use of new  technologies like big data, open data, cloud, IoT, platforms, artificial intelligence, and social networks  with increasing intelligence and automation enterprises can capitalize on new opportunities and optimize  existing operations to achieve significant business improvement .   2.  Theoretical background  The new approach is the revised legislative proposal on waste. It covers long-term recycling targets for  municipal and packaging waste, measures to limit landfilling, and incentives for Member States to use  economic instruments at the national level . It also aims to promote cooperation between industries,  with waste from one process becoming secondary materials for others, through a simplified legal  framework for by-products and end-of-waste status, creating more certainty for operators in these  markets. That leads us for an opportunity to build value networks from the point of side flows of waste.  It leads to a business opportunity for industrial symbiosis.   The key notice on sustainability is what extent it will be impact to specific business sector and  influences on creation of circular economy business and industrial symbiosis.  It is an industry-changing  paradigm integrating innovation, differentiation and transformation. Tajani  has started, that there  will be no sustainability without competitiveness, and there will be no long-lasting competitiveness  without sustainability and there will be neither of them without a quantum leap in innovation.   Industry 4.0 describes the organization of production processes based on technology and devices  autonomously communicating with each other along the value chain. Industry 4.0 architecture takes  account of the increased digitalization of various industries where physical objects are seamlessly  integrated into the information network, allowing for decentralized production and real-time adaptation  in the future . What is characteristics to Industry 4.0 is that it involves connecting products to each  other. Industry 4.0 is a closely linked to Cyber-Physical Systems   and can be defined as  transformative technologies, which manage interconnected systems between its physical assets and  computational capabilities .  To be successful on new challenges of Industry 4.0 development,  enterprise-university partnerships has to be intense and main objective should be a shared learning.  Long-term co-operation creates a background for new co-innovation and co- evolution. Adapting  Industry 4.0 framework as a basis for development activities has expected to provide an opportunity for  remarkable competitive advantage for businesses but also for regions .  Nidumolu, Prahalad and Rangaswami,  explain widely why sustainability is now the key driver  of innovation . The biggest benefit comes from generating and processing big data.  Information  technology helps make large amounts of data available for different purposes in the public or private  sector with minimum effort and costs . Conradie & Choenni  have recognized that the most  reliable method how to identify the datasets with big potential is a demand-based approach, which means  a close cooperation with potential end users. Every participant in ecosystem has an opportunity to  participate on creation of innovations and value, which generally is produced on the boundaries of  ecosystem stakeholders .  Business ecosystem can be born as group activity or a single company  can create it by collaborative activities .   3.  Research questions and research approach  Nations are struggling with big global challenges like climate change, lack of resources, waste problems  etc., but nations and companies are also facing changes because of digitalization at the stage of the fourth  industrial devolution.  The role of circular economy and digitalization as a business driver is growing in waste management  and as digital symbiosis in industrial innovation platform. The main research questions are  a) What are the future key factors to solve waste problem on a sustainable way?  Efficient waste treatment-2018 IOP Conf. Series: Earth and Environmental Science 337  012032IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1755-1315/337/1/012032 3            b) How to manage change towards circular economy from waste management?  c) How to evaluate the profitability of circular economy development investment?  This article introduces a concept model for utilizing circular economy and digitalization as a business  and innovation driver to facilitate the transition from waste management towards circular economy and  digital symbiosis.  4.  Circular economy framework  The circular economy refers to an industrial economy that is restorative by intention; aims to rely on  renewable energy; minimizes, tracks, and hopefully eliminates the use of toxic chemicals; and eradicates  waste through careful design . The system diagram in figure 1 illustrates the continuous flow of  technical and biological materials through the value network.   The term goes beyond the mechanics of production and consumption of goods and services, in the  areas that it seeks to redefine (examples include rebuilding capital including social and natural, and the  shift from consumer to user). The concept of the circular economy is grounded in the study of non- linear, particularly living systems . This ensures enhanced flows of goods and services.    Figure 1.  The circular  economy - an industrial  system that is restorative  by design .  5.  New business via industrial symbiosis   Changing economic structures, intensifying environmental problems and increasing demand-related  requirements all mean that companies need to come up with more resource-intensive solutions. These  can be achieved through co-operation between companies operating in various sectors, and alongside  local authorities and municipalities.  Industrial symbiosis is an industrial ecosystem in which unused or residual resources of one company  are used by another. This results in mutual economic, social and environmental benefits. It is a process  involving several companies – firms that complement one another provide mutual added value through  efficient use of raw materials, technology, services and energy. Joint development of industrial  symbiosis provides an efficient way of thinking up, developing and testing product and service  innovations. This, in turn, engenders new competencies, on which new business operations can utilize.  Business ecosystems based on industrial symbiosis provide more added value by using fewer natural  resources than traditional industrial value chains. This means more efficient energy and water  consumption, and reduced waste. In industrial symbiosis, industrial operations, energy production,  primary production, waste processing and the services supporting these combine to form an entity that  provides products and services for end-user needs, while optimizing resource use.   6.  Challenges and opportunities in Russia  21st century is characterized as the first Urban Century in the history of humankind.  

Efficient waste treatment-2018 IOP Conf. Series: Earth and Environmental Science 337  012032IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1755-1315/337/1/012032 4            In Russia waste management was a challenge already in Soviet times, but since the beginning of  2000ies it has become one of the most critical economic and environmental problems in Russia. For  many years, the Russian government’s priorities focused on oil and gas, defence and heavy industries,  while waste management was considered to be an issue for future generations and continuously  neglected.   Russia has a legal and regulatory framework in the environmental area, but responsibilities are  distributed between many bodies that enforce and control the regulations poorly. As a result,  environmental protection in general and waste management in particular, is an increasing concern.   With recent changes in lifestyle, increasing waste volumes to such high levels that current facilities  and outdated technologies are insufficient, the problem becomes definitely crucial. Experts believe that  poor environmental situation contribute to a also short life expectancy at birth in Russian Federation  .   Figure 2.  There is huge  potential to develop  circular economy in  Russia .     Anyhow, comparison to western European development can be misleading, because of size of  country or the structure of industry or the consumer habits. Eg. in case of Finland, all the waste is not  collected and treated in a proper way because of long distances.   Figure 3.  Treatment of  Household waste in  European countries in  year 2016 ..    Circular Economy concept has also a very strong strategic approach for many countries. Since some  materials, which are needed in high-tech products, are running short and availability from the ground is  decreasing. Therefore, those strategic materials, which are needed, are mainly in the products, which we  use now.  In case of Finland, circular economy is a part of Finnish innovation policy and Finland wants be the  leading country in circular economy in the year 2025.  

Efficient waste treatment-2018 IOP Conf. Series: Earth and Environmental Science 337  012032IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1755-1315/337/1/012032 5            Experiences coming from Finland show that joint development of industrial symbiosis provides an  efficient way of thinking, developing and testing product and service innovations. This, in turn,  engenders new competencies, on which new business operations can be based.  The co-operation between government, enterprise and universities is essential to succeed in co- evolution, when building up cumulative competence in creation of solutions for circular economy by  benefiting digitalization in it. It is also essential to have a common vision to direct the local operation  and funding. Otherwise, the activities can splinter as small pieces and do not form parts of the whole  vision.  In rapidly changing operational environment, it a clear and commonly understood vision is required.  7.  Forming triangle - Industrial symbiosis, digitalization and legislation   On the above mentioned, we can suppose that triangle consists of the industrial symbiosis, digitalization  and legislation. This industrial symbiosis can involve stakeholders at all levels (companies, authorities  of different levels and municipalities, smart and digital technologies and legislation agencies and  experts) to develop a methodology and software platform to facilitate the exchange of information that  can support industrial symbiosis networks, create and support pilot projects and replicate their results at  local and regional levels.   Such model has to be designed on the triangle presented on the Figure 4 and, considering Economical  Environmental and social issues during whole companies’ lifecycle, it can lead to use fewer natural  resources and more benefit. Applying these models can create new business and new challenges for  companies and economy.                       Figure 4.  Industrial symbiosis, digitalization and legislation as forming triangle   8.  Towards the opportunities of new material sources  Megacities are facing challenges in its waste management. On the other hand megacities have not yet  been active to take use the latest concepts in circular economy thinking.  Including this, in the fast Industrial  symbiosis digitalization  and  innovations New business  -New  challengies legislation  Environmental  issue  Economical  issue  Social issue   Efficient waste treatment-2018 IOP Conf. Series: Earth and Environmental Science 337  012032IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1755-1315/337/1/012032 6            development of digitalisation, there will be new technical solutions in market, which can provide new  possibilities and business models.  Therefore, there are new tools and concepts to build up the future approach and strategy to solve  waste problem or, in the other words, take benefit to circulate material and use the waste for the materials  of new products or turn into energy. One proposed approach is to take full use of the concept of circular  economy and learn the best practices from other countries. Anyhow, learning the best practices does not  mean simply coping ideas from other countries and bringing copies. In these cases, we should see  learning so that we are able to implement the best practices, so that they fit into local environment and  traditions.  In this case, the approach will be related to circular economy and digitalisation, there will be need  for large and long-lasting cooperation between government, universities and enterprises to be able to  manage the change. Anyhow, this change has to be seen so that it creates huge amount new innovation  and build-up new business models and business.  The expenses of circular economy development should not be calculated in short turn business profit  basis but it should be seen as long term strategic investment which will bring long term benefits to  different sectors of society.  9.  Discussion and Conclusions  Circular economy and industrial symbiosis should not be seen only the way to solve the waste  management problem, but it can also be seen as the part of social and economic development. The  change towards circular economy takes time and it needs actions from different sectors (universities,  government and private sector).  Digital ecosystems and industrial symbiosis should be seen as continuous developing entirety, which  will change and renew themselves thus maintaining their competiveness.   Digitalization, circular economy and industrial symbiosis are the key drivers, which will change the  business environments, a way to act and create innovation. Innovations will need “real life”   piloting environments. Both, resource efficiency and digitalization are directing  towards service business and environments.  The expenses of circular economy development should not be calculated in short turn business profit  basis but circular economy development should be seen as long term strategic investment which will  bring long term benefits to different sectors of society.
