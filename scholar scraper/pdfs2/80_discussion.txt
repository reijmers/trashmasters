In this section, we discuss the future of MSW managementin Nigeria. In the first part, the theoretical quantities of
urban solid waste to be generated in Nigeria in the future
were calculated and discussed, while in the second part we
discuss the prospects for circular economy adoption.Future projections of solid waste generation
and collection rates in Nigeria
Many socio-economic parameters influence the quantity of
waste generation in cities. But the most accepted general
factors sensitive to making projections are; the city ’s pop-
ulation, population growth index, and per capita waste
generation [64]. Nigeria ’s total population P 20XY, (current
and future year) is calculated with the model given as:
P20XY/equalsP2006(1+r/slashbig100)20XY −2006(1)
where P 2006= 140,431,790 (2006 population census ﬁgure);
r=3.2 (annual population growth index, which is a national
value) [55],
The urban population for the current/future year is
calculated with the model:
