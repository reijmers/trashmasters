: a synthesis of research streams and research 
agenda 
The findings from KCN analysis in Section 4 suggested that impact 
assessment, biorefinery and nutrient recycling are three underlying 
research lines in extant literature. This is supported by a significant 
number of articles found on these topics from the structural dimension 
analysis (Section 5). However, the fine-grained analysis in Section 5 also 
gave rise to other critical factors of FLW management under the CE 
framework. Methodological analysis indicated the important role of the 
FLW flows quantification and statistical assessment. Three types of FLW 
flows – surplus, homogeneity and heterogeneity – follow different pre-
vention and management pathways, but they encounter challenges 
arising from the following sources: technologies, supply, quantification, 
logistics, market factors, policy. Grounded in the detailed and extensive 
analysis, we propose a novel way of classifying the literature in FLW 
management under the CE into six research streams: (i) FLW stream 
supply and quantification, (ii) practices and technological aspects, (iii) 
logistics and supply chain management, (vi) market demand, (v) SIA, 
(vi) policy and legislation. This novel classification aims to push further 
evolution in this ever-increasing research agenda (Table 5). 
6.1. FLW supply and quantification 
The reliable quantification of potential FLW flows is the first and 
crucial step in supporting the formation of effective FLW interventions 
and policies in all three flows of FLW (Corrado and Sala, 2018 ; Hamelin
