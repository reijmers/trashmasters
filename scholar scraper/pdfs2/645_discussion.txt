3.1 Social  Program  
One of the case studies  in the MASARO's  social  program  implementation  is in the Pasawahan  region,  
Bandung.  One of the critical  point s in this system  is the local  market.  This market  is acting  as the place  
for crops  selling  and waste  source.  The waste  is then transported  back  to the community  where  it will 
be shredded.  The shredding  process  is held by 2 methods,  using  a shredding  machine  or with the help 
from  the community.  This step is also acted  as a vessel  for social  interaction  and movement  towards  a 
green,  clean,  and producti ve Pasawahan  region  community.   The shredded  slow-decaying  organic  
waste  will be processed  for composting.  The composting  process  is done  using  MASARO  bio-
composter.  This process  is more  effective  compared  to a typical  composting  process  by only taking  7 
days of composting  process.  Product  of this process  is used as fertilizer  for the polybag  farming  system  
with 4:3:2:1  volumetric  ratio,  4-parts  growth  medium,  3-parts  animal  feces, 2-parts  MASARO  
compost,  and 1-part charcoal.  This polybag  farming  is held from houses  in the community.  Social  
program  implementation  in Pasawahan  region  can be seen in figure  4.
