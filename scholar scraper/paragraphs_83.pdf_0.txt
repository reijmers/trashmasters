yutao wang keywords circular economy consumption work sharing economy labor abstract circular economy frameworks have become central to debates and interventions that aim to reduce global resource use and environmental despoilment as pathways to both systemic and microscale transformations there remain many challenges to making circular economy actionable one such challenge is facilitating the emergence of the circular consumer here we are all encouraged to shift everyday practices to consume new products and services andor participate in the sharing economy all of which are claimed in some prominent debates to automatically offer more convenience for the consumer in response this paper argues that viewing such debates through the lens of consumption work offers a different picture of what it takes to be and what we need to know about the circular consumer consumption work refers to the labour integral to the purchase use reuse and disposal of goods and services this paper argues that the nature and scope of such work has been underplayed in circular economy debates to date and that becoming a circular consumer requires varied and unevenly distributed forms of consumption work which in turn has significant implications for the success of circular economy this paper thus proposes a research agenda into this topic outlining five interrelated critical issues that a circular economy research agenda must address including questions of who undertakes consumption work to what ends and how its multiple forms are coordinated within and beyond the household introduction circular economy and consumption work circular economy ce is now central to debates and interventions that aim to transition systems towards greater environmental sustain ability while definitions abound ce is commonly understood as transforming interlinked productionconsumption systems to ones where the value of products materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible and the generation of waste mini mised european commission such transformations involve stepchanges to industrial processes and product design as well as reconfigured business models for example from sale andownership to product service systems mylan that in turn impact con sumption patterns practices and norms although sometimes presented as a new framework ce has its roots in fields such as industrial ecology eg clift and druckman sustainable and cradletocradle design mcdonough and braungart and natural capitalism hawken et al fields with their own histories of debate exper imentation and implementation reike et al as such part of the appeal of recent iterations of ce is how they bring together disparate fields into a model of comprehensive macroscale transformations however as gregson et al note despite idealized visions of the circular economy that propose a producerled industrial revolution much ce policy and practice thus far is largely one of enhanced postconsumer waste management nevertheless the eu ropean union and china are amongst those now aligning their st century regional development and competitiveness agendas with the perceived advantages of ce eg see european commission mcdowall et al according to the european commission this will help in protecting businesses against scarcity of resources and volatile prices while creating improved system efficiencies new jobs and greater social integration and cohesion in response to such ambitions a rapidly growing and cross disciplinary research literature has emerged exploring multiple facets of ce this journal alone has published many ce papers including research focused on sustainable supply chain management sadrnia et al circular business model innovation guldmann and huulgaard and countrylevel enactments of the ce ghisellini and ulgiati research on the consumption and consumerrelated aspects of ce has also been part of this literature but to date has constituted a smaller

less than of ce definitions include consumption as a key factor in interventions kirchherr et al this latter body of work at times utilises social psychology meth odologies to for example model relationships between environmental awareness and purchasing intentions eg panda et al whilst insightful critiques of such approaches outline the problems with supposing clear relationships exist between individuals awareness values or attitudes and their consumption activity the notorious atti tudebehaviour or valueaction gap kollmuss and agyeman as such consumers knowledge andintention often illuminate little about what they actually do carrington et al davies et al soler et al in response other social researchers have fore grounded the importance of contexts of actions eg the role infra structure plays in facilitating forms of sustainable consumption soler et al as well as the actual resource management practices car ried out in households eg mylan et al pedersen and manhice together this work underscores the importance of bringing varied social theories which focus on the relationship between life as lived and the materials cultures and discourses these lives are embedded ininto ce research holmes mylan welch and warde this paper builds upon and contributes to this body of theoretically informed social science ce research the main goal is to argue for the analytical value of bringing the sociological concept of consumption work wheeler and glucksmann a into ce research to establish an associated and comprehensive research agenda briefly consump tion work cw denotes forms of labour necessary for the purchase use reuse and disposal of consumption goods and services wheeler and glucksmann a such nowubiquitous labour includes for example cleaning sorting and removing household recyclables scan ning barcodes at a selfservice check out building flat pack furniture or selfinstalling home broadband as such cw is now often a nonnegotiable component to complete and complement an economic process glucksmann thus highlighting how the seemingly private domain of the home and of household consumption is actually an integral part of the successful functioning of macroeconomic systems this paper argues that the lens of cw can thus offer vital insight into how consumerfocused forms of ce require both the reconfiguration of existing modes of cw eg increased domestic recycling activities and or the establishment of new forms of cw eg repairing or sharing material assets in turn the ability of individuals and households to undertake such cw depend in part upon various vital resources eg time skills social capital all of which are not distributed equally among populations this paper argues that therefore the nature scale and distribution of ce cw will have a significant impact on the suc cessful emergence of the circular consumer yet to date this argument has not received much critical attention in the published literature or broader debates thus there is a need for an active and focused research agenda proposed herein in making these arguments this paper first explores the role ascribed to the ce consumer in some mainstream policies and debates it then outlines the theory and application of cw arguing for its utility in gaining fresh insight into the role of consumption in ce then the theory of cw is applied to examples of consumerfocused ce practices including forms of sharing and repairing this paper then concludes by outlining a research agenda for cw and ce which is argued to offer muchneeded insight into this integral part of broader ce agendas consumers and consumption in ce from acceptance to engagement there is a growing body of research that examines ce consumption including its dynamics in the household sphere as part of a ce agenda see ghisellini et al hobson and lynch merli et al mylan et al such a focus is vital to any sustainability agenda for example the committee on climate change calculated that uk emissions of kg co e per household must drop to kg if we are to reach the goal of net zero emissions by a situation that prompted the exuk government chief scientist to note that uk life styles must change and that we all must shift ourselves away from consuming harrabin a no page this latter point is one many researchers and commentators have made for decades see conca et al yet consumption indicators continue to show clear resourceuse increases around the world eg irp even taking into account effects of the global covid pandemic on greenhouse gas emissions see lenzen et al while some advocates argue that consumption in the ce is not about consuming less but consuming differently see below others point out that this assertion is problematic eg see hofmann for one certain ce actions eg creating new markets for down and upcycled goods are doing little to prompt muchneeded absolute demand re ductions with considerable systemlevel rebound effects observed zink and geyer as such ce research to date has arguably paid too much attention to forging and promoting new business markets and models and not enough to slowing the loops merli et al of existing markets and models how then is the consumer conceptualised in ce thinking one muchrepeated visual representation of ce ie the butterfly diagram see ellen macarthur foundation places the userconsumer as the central node around which resources flow and new practices emerge ie those of sharing repairing and maintaining goods and moving goods on for reuse remanufacturing andor recycling welch et al yetdespite the active engagement of householders required by many of these practices as well as the skills knowledge and time invol vedthe role of the consumer in ce has been framed primarily in terms of willingness to take up and accept new business models andor products eg camachootero et al van weelden et al although one can debate what the notion of acceptance means here it arguably suggests a largely passive and unproblematic engagement with the requirements of ce hobson that is one where productionconsumption systems change around us all and our role is to be the recipient or not of these changes as part of prevailing green growth approaches alvarado et al take for example the work of the ellen macarthur foundation the preeminent nongovernmental proponent of ce their report opportu nities for the consumer goods sector arguably places consumer participation in new goods and services as something of an after thought once new ce market opportunities have been identified consumer research would be needed to better understand con sumers acceptance although others argue that we all should be included in creating ce goods and services from their initia tion eg participatory sustainable design eg see sinclair et al such messages do not appear to have infiltrated highlevel ce discourses along similar lines repo et al assert that there is a pressing need for eu citizens to become integrated in policy planning as active players in the realm of circular economy a situation they argue is far from the current role ascribed to the consumer in eu ce policies how then is the consumer responding to ce interventions to date notable ce consumer research does exist for the most part focusing on the willingness of consumers to undertake specific cerelated con sumption practices eg see borrello et al gaur et al which may or may not involve new forms of cw eg undertaking in dependent research into buying a new product before purchasing it such work sits alongside other research that explores the numerous barriers to the collective acceptance of new products and services eg see camachootero et al taken together findings to date have suggested little reason to be optimistic that such approaches to more circular consumption can deliver ce ambitious goals for example van weelden et al outline how refurbished mobile phones are often rejected by consumers looking to buy a new phone due to a lack of k hobson et al journal of cleaner production knowledge about their availability along with concerns about the pro cess of refurbishment see also hazen et al on the same topic hobson et al outline how mobile phone users express reluctance to undertake any additional form of cw when purchasing or using their phones as well as reluctance to recycle their current phones because of data concerns on similar lines single product case studies exist that outline the numerous barriers to consumer uptake of ce business models and practices eg catulli and reed lieder et al these include personal characteristics price confidence in the offer convenience and knowledge camachootero et al schallehn et al thus it appears there are many challenges in getting the consumer on board with the ce particularly with more circular products and services being brought into already crowded and competitive markets eg consumer electronics see hobson et al made more challenging by the inherent irrationality of consumer behaviour planing one potentially fruitful way of reconceptualising such challenges is to bring the concept of consumption work cw into conversation with such findings which this paper argues could help illuminate missing or underdeveloped facets of the ce consumer for one talk of new ce business models often fails to acknowledge the cw required this may include engaging in a range of materialspecific recycling practices borrowing rather than owning items learning how to maintain and repair possessions andor acquiring the knowledge to choose products on the basis of circular characteristics such as modularity and product longevity as such the ce both introduces new and extends existing forms of domestic labour labour that is often represented ironically as being accounted for by the concept of consumer convenience in the extant literature wieser however as the remainder of this paper will argue labelling ce practices as convenient tells us little about how the potentially con flicting demands of ce impacts on everyday lives particularly when more than one practice is brought into play eg does more time spent repairing goods mean less time is available for other cerelated prac tices it also does little to illuminate who where and in what ways new forms of cw are distributed through populations a vital issue if we think that alterations to consumption practices need to be defused and nor malised throughout society to become integrated into everyones practices the following section develops these arguments further expanding on the concept of cw and using examples from sharing economy practices to illustrate the argument further consumption work in the circular economy the concept of consumption work and its relevance to the circular economy since early industrialization social researchers have been keenly interested in questions of divisions of labour initially focusing on the workplace research explored how the specialization of jobs and skills have farreaching ramifications for socioeconomic equality and thus broader distributions of political agency and power subsequent focus has included unpaid forms of labour eg gender divisions within households glucksmann as well as how informal economies constitute networks of communal and household reciprocity pahl miriam glucksmann has further extended these arguments see also wheeler and glucksmann a b highlighting how a key part of unpaid labour is cw that is the forms of labour necessary for the purchase use reuse and disposal of consumption goods and services a this labour includes consumption enacted through varying modes of provision whether ownership or accessbased cw is thus not about any form of domestic labour specifically it concerns the work that householders regularly perform which is in tegral to the completion of a process of production or service provision wheeler and glucksmann a glucksmann notes how many cw activities thus go unrecognised as labour but should be classified and analysed as such given how integral cw is to material social reproduction ibid for example studies of environmental labour within the domestic sphere eg practices such as recycling and preventing food waste have shown that women do more of this work e g organo et al which means that men and women are differ ently affected by sustainable consumption policy middlemiss and as the forms of labour required by us all to consume continue to shifteg the rise of selfservice supermarket checkouts and selfassembly furniture wheeler and glucksmann aso do the requirements and divisions of these forms of labour such requirements are not just a matter of having more or less time available to spend on said tasks they also speak to the need for consumers to have access to particular skills knowledge andor other resources eg tools for selfassembly furniture as well as personal attributes confidence willingness all of which are not evenly distributed amongst populations new forms of cw include practices that are a pivotal part of ce the labour required for domestic recyclingcleaning sorting and putting items on the kerb or taking them to a recycling stationis vital to the successful functioning of contemporary waste management industries and systems wheeler and glucksmann a with their incorrect execution being one of the main challenges for the modern recycling industry walsh add to that the other consumeruser practices that ce foregrounds eg repairing reusing and sharing and it quickly becomes apparent that the consumers roles in the ce is far beyond that of acceptance of novel products and business models and while it can be claimed that household ecoefficient technologies and products can sidestep some of these issues doing most of the work for the house holder research has shown nontrivial forms of green labour are still involved in the operation and management of for example smart do mestic technologies farbotko thus it is arguable that without the widespread adoption of the forms of cw that the ce necessitates the entire project becomes untenable particularly given comments that current ce framings and policies fail to resonate with citizens repo et al to be clear the concept of the cw is not deployed here to bemoan the unpaid labour of consumers as an exploitative facet of current systems per se nor does it go to the other extreme celebrating the multiple benefits that ce practices are often charged with ushering in for example through forms of collaborative consumption see botsman and rogers that are claimed to create other social goods see penz et al rather its work here is that of a conceptual inter vention the empirics of which are argued to shed new and important light on the reconfiguration of divisions of labour presupposed by ce visions and models which includes the possibilities for their successful realisation and for unintended consequences as the next section will explore this argument can be illustrated well through notions of the sharing economy a central focus of ce debates to date focus of ce debates to date the consumption work of the sharing economy the sharing economy is argued as playing a pivotal role in ce eg ellen macarthur foundation and for this reason this paper uses it as a key probe through which to explore the implications of cw within ce here new practices and platforms deploy underutilised assets monetised or not in ways that improve efficiency sustainability and community rinne no page this can take the form of the renting out of ones spare rooms or properties as with airbnb or sharing surplus food in the local community eg city harvest london no date such initiatives are argued to potentially create billion euros worth of transactions by pwc as well as fostering novel forms of consumption and new emotional and motivational en gagements welch et al while creating environmental benefits through reducing resource use bocken et al homrich et al k hobson et al journal of cleaner production however research has shown that some sharing initiatives do little to address the social and sustainability issues they claim to overcome schor et al holmes for example research by holmes has illuminated how sharing endeavours whilst temporarily diverting some waste from landfill can also see shared resources ulti mately ending up there with added cw for intermediaries as such there is a need to cast a critical eye over the actual outcomes and impacts of forms of sharing including the role that new forms of cw play eg see schor et al and in further understanding the dynamics of ce cw there is arguably an important analytical distinction to be made between accessbased and ownershipbased forms of ce consumption practice outlined in table below see wieser accessbased ce consumption is where no transfer of ownership takes place bardhi and eckhardt that is goods can be leased which may involve individual and unlimited access eg the private leasing of a car or limited and sequential access eg joining a carsharing club or pooling which necessitates simultaneous access e g carpooling with shared ownership tukker by contrast ownershipbased ce practices can involve sequential sharing such as passing along unwanted items from one owner to the next or coowning assets such as housing coownership cooperatives although individual ownership in table in reality falls outside the purview of se it does form a key component of consumerfocused ce practices eg the care and repair of owned goods to elongate product life spans see cooper as such table aims to capture various ce and sharingrelated spheres of practice such as the peertopeer economy the secondhand economy the collaborative economy and productservice systems to show examples of them in terms of consumer involvement all of the above practices require both distinct and overlapping forms of cw for practices in the individual ownership category of table some argue they involve less cw by eliminating inconveniences caused by the current poor quality and obsolescence of owned goods that is for the customer overcoming premature obsolescence will signifi cantly bring down total ownership costs and deliver higher convenience due to avoiding hassles associated with repairs and returns ellen macarthur foundation at face value this statement appears unproblematic however little is known about the cw involved in buying longerlasting products what one assumes is being referred to in the phrase overcoming premature obsolescence studies that have explored this area argue that product lifetime optimisation consumer behaviour across the stages of prod uct acquisition use and disposal evans and cooper is currently characterised by a lack of consumer knowledge and skills in identifying longerlasting products in turn research into specific con sumer practices of product care including repair and maintenance show that these require time effort and competences which can limit the involvement of some individuals for others however new forms of cw encourage participation particularly when it is framed and felt as challenge andor fun ackermann et al see also holmes as such assuming longerlasting products equate with less cw overall is unproven and requires further scrutiny if it is to be a pillar of the ce claims of greater convenience are also made for the accessbased forms of se influential multinational consultancies such as pwc and deloitte are amongst those who have underscored the business gains to be had from ce including comments such as the sharing economy is convenient for both the consumer and the service provider it provides consumers with convenient and costefficient access to re sources and to access various services with a few taps on their smart phones ernst and young forms of leasing renting borrowing or pooling that are facilitated digitally are thus argued by advocates to relieve consumers from the burdens of ownership cherry and pidgeon however some researchers have turned their attention to the burdens of access hazee et al here research has found that while not having to repair maintain or buy new privately owned goods is looked upon favourably by some an equal number find it time consuming to borrow or rent goods hirschl et al there are also feelings of added re sponsibility and at times anxiety about being in possession of nonowned products which some users feel a need to take greater not less care of see cherry and pigeon fraanje and spaargaren in terms of sequential access research on renting and borrowing has identified various forms of cw that users need to do along with how these are experienced for example while carsharing reduces the la bour and cost of appropriating and caring for a car bardhi and eck hardt there is notable planning and logistical work involved in participating in carsharing this can include scheduling use of the car potentially rearranging plans due to the relative inflexibility of car sharing returning the car reporting issues with vehicles and dealing with dirty cars or low fuel fraanje and spaargaren hazee et al for other forms of peertopeer borrowing and renting philip et al remark that renters need to browse find and request their wanted items contact the seller for available times and places to meet for pickup and dropoff arrange payment return the item in the same condition as originally rented and also leave feedback for the provider in the above research their participants lamented the efforts required to take part in peertopeer sharing leading the authors to conclude that these forms of cw can be a major deterrent for users fraanje and spaargaren also found in a study of carsharing cooperatives that many members found the social aspects encour aged by the serviceprovider to be burdensome emotional labour preferring instead more impersonal consumption taken together all of the above research points towards much more going on under the sur face of the convenience inconvenience labels given to cw in the ce to date indeed accepting claims that the ce will ease cw burdens for consumers cannot be taken at face value and thus require much closer scrutiny with the suggestion of a potential research agenda as such detailed in the following section s that many members found the social aspects encouraged by the serviceprovider as burdensome emotional labour preferring more impersonal consumption taken together all of the above research points towards much more going on under the sur face of the convenience inconvenience labels given to cw in the ce to date indeed accepting claims that the ce will ease cw burdens for consumers can no longer be taken at face value and thus require much closer scrutiny with the suggestion of a potential research agenda detailed in the following section the circular economy and consumption work a research agenda as the previous section outlined research already offers some insight into the importance of considering cw in the reconfiguration of con sumers practices as part of ce yet more much information is still needed and this section sets out some key questions for one extant knowledge of ce cw remains fragmented in terms of both terminology and empirical focus existing relevant research does explore the table circular economy and sharing economy modes of provision from wieser consumption individual sequential simultaneous access individual access eg product service system leasing pay per use sequential access eg renting borrowing simultaneous access eg pooling ownership individual ownership eg product service system repair maintenance reduce sequential ownership eg secondhand gift reuse repeat exchanges simultaneous ownership eg coowning k hobson et al journal of cleaner production demands of ce cw to some extent often under the guise of different concepts such as inconvenience effort domestic labour andor co creation however these different concepts make it challenging to un dertake direct comparisons between examples as such cw has thus far not been studied systematically in the ce context beyond wheeler and glucksmann s research on domestic recycling ibid this is a notable gap as supposed benefits like added convenience represent an important value proposition for ce proponents and yet the actual work consumers need to undertake to invest in new practices compared to traditional linear modes of provision remains underexplored while ce advocates make claims of hasslefree services studies show there is often significant effort required in doing repairs purchasing second hand or participating in peertopeer sharing how these all add up to helping create the circular consumer or not remains to be seen there are several areas of research that stem from the above point for onewhile case studies of recycling product service systems and sharing platforms make up the bulk of the literature it is notable that the practices of leasing purchasing longlasting products coownership and pooling are understudied wieser this is a clear omission as many of these practices are heavily implicated in current ce debates and policies for example the eu action plan for the circular economy considers prolonging product lifetimes as an important component of the ce european commission exemplified in the right to repair legislation which is a part of this overall strategy ehgartner and hirth harrabin b therefore question here include what forms of cw are involved in realising this goal how are the prerequisites for this work eg access to information currently distributed and what is needed to address any barriers that additional cw might create for consumers as well as particular practices that require further research various components of cw are also understudied for one some consumer engagements with the ce involve degrees of skill and creativity while research has shown these can be lacking in some areas eg identifying longlasting products at the point of purchase other research outlines how experience over time enables consumers to feel confident and competent in engaging with particular modes of consumption eg when shopping at second hand markets crewe and gregson in addi tion cw can entail forms of emotional work that are only partially explored in research to date for one some ce modes of provision appear to make consumers feel obliged to take care of and be respon sible for the condition of goods one example can be found in a refillable milk bottle scheme vaughan et al where consumers took extra care of and felt some stewardship towards the reused and returned bottles even though this was not required for them to participate in the service however other studies report the opposite effect ie consumers taking less care with sequentially accessed goods eg bardhi and eck hardt this suggests that more attention needs to be paid to variations across different modes of provisioning and in what ways consumers are made to feel responsible for the goods that pass through their hands plus the impacts all of the above have on the takeup of new practices one notable feature of the research to date has been how it often examines one consumption practice at a time eg repairing goods renting goods or participating in a new product service system for there to be a fuller understanding of the scope and changes to cw if the ce is to become a domestic reality there also needs to be explorations of how cw is coordinated across household activities along with the temporal dimensions of such activities we already know that the adoption of one form of domestic practice can have sometimes unde sirable knockon effects on others eg more domestic recycling often leads to less cw in other waste prevention behaviours in a household e g cox et al yet we do not currently know how potential con flicts between competing ce solutions play out nor how any conflicts are or are not resolved amongst householders is there a ceiling to consumers participation in the ce and if so what combinations of ce practices are tenable for what types of households and what forms of supporting infrastructures are required to foster yet more engagement to the point where household emissions are brought down to the levels recommended by the committee on climate change ibid a key factor in addressing these questions are issues of divisions of labour this is an area rarely included in discussions of the ce but one that the concept of cw is especially attuned to research on household cw does show that there is an unequal distribution of labour especially in terms of the gendered division of domestic labour eg see glucks mann on recycling however there exists little knowledge about if and how ce cw differs from established arrangements in terms of domestic division of labour in this respect comparative research could provide valuable insights such research could take account both the gendered division of labour within ce cw activities and how other sociodemographic factors such as household makeup class employ ment typepatterns race and ethnicity all influence the uptake and engagement of ce cw in short who is doing the cw why and to what affect finally there are questions of where and how to do cw research for one there currently exists a limited range of extant and easily visible form of consumptionbased ce practice which would allow researchers to trace the requirements they make of consumers and their impacts in particular while the uptake of singular ce activities is reasonably well documented eg numbers joining car sharing schemes less is known about how many households are undertaking multiple forms of ce practice which would enable questions of coordination to be addressed furthermore there is the methodological challenge of how to conduct research on cw that forms part of private domestic realms that is often habitual and conditioned by unarticulated norms eg see wonneck and hobson methodologically such research has precedents in practice theory research halkier et al warde et al which often deploys detailed qualitative in situ approaches utilising small n samples to understand in detail the rationales and outcomes of particular consumption practices eg gramhanssen while much of this work is descriptive of current practices research into ce cw would need to adopt a more actionresearch ethos eg see doyle and davies wherein research happens alongside householders experimenting in consciously changing their practices eg recruiting a small sample of households to live like circular citizens for several months see davies and doyle finally research into ce cw needs to move beyond the domestic sphere and space of the household to consider engagement with consumptionbased practices in other spaces this could be individuals coming together once a month to participate in a local repair cafe or household engagements with communitybased ce business models whether they are explicitly labelled as such this is because some consumerbased ce practices are not bound to the home but are rather implicated in establishing new patterns of for example mobility prac tices practices which in turn influence ce cw household dynamics concluding comments in reviewing the literature relevant to ce cw two key findings stand out first ce cw has so far not been studied systematically beyond wheeler and glucksmann s research into recycling extant knowledge of ce cw is therefore limited fragmentary and scattered throughout studies framed through concepts such as domestic labour and cocre ation and looser terms such as convenience and effort furthermore there are considerable gaps in ce literature especially in relation to cw involved in coownership pooling repeat exchanges and avoidance of packaging second it is clear that forms of provisioning associated with ce including those most strongly associated with convenience involve significant cw as noted prevailing models of ce require the reconfi guration of existing modes of cw eg increased domestic recycling activities andor the establishment of new forms of cw eg repairing sharing all of which are assumed in the longrun to make life easier or at least more pleasant and socially connected for the consumer an k hobson et al journal of cleaner production assertion that is far from proven to date in response this paper set out five interrelated critical issues that a research agenda of ce cw must address first is the importance of the coordination of cw across household activities for ce consumption practices to be viable at the household level such cw coordination would be vital given the paucity of examples of household ce activity understanding household ce cw is currently speculative necessitating innovative actionoriented research second there is clearly a complex relationship between cw and consumption norms for one conve nience has a central place in contemporary consumption expectations with its enhancement often assumed by ce advocates yet the actual cw involved in ce options and well as consumers willingness to off set convenience against other norms eg not wasting resources is poorly understood third and relatedly ce cw involves degrees of competence skills and sometimes creativity how these may be ac quired diffused and thus become routinized and habitual is an open question fourth research suggests that cw is often but not always infused with an ethic of carefor material objects others and or the environment ce research must therefore pay attention to varia tions across different modes of provision and populations as to the ways in which consumers are made to feel responsible and come to express an ethics of care finally cw inherently concerns divisions of labour there has been little engagement in ce literature to date with how labour is being moved along the supply chain in new forms of allegedly circular business models and the implications for such shifts in terms of what is being expected of and what is possible for the consumeruser such concerns must be central to a research agenda on ce cw if any in terventions are not to exacerbate alreadyexisting inequalities or have knockon effects of increasing overall resourceuse in short just as energyintensive processes are needed to sustain the material flows of the ce so it goes for some forms of labour labour that sits behind and remains obscured by headline assumptions such as those of increased consumer convenience thus to fully evaluate the core claims for the all round benefits of ce understanding the complexities of ce cw needs to be part of an enlarged and critical research agenda credit authorship contribution statement kersty hobson conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing helen holmes
