phosphorus circular economy of disposable baby nappy waste quanti cation assessment of recycling technologies and plan for sustainability rubel biswas chowdhury mayuri wijayasundara school of engineering deakin university waurn ponds victoria australia highlights australia lost tonne phosphorus p in baby nappy waste in p recovery is overlooked in most of the recycling technologies for nappy waste composting pyrolysis and polymer separation are common nappy recycling methods use of nappy waste compost for bam boo and cotton production can close the loop new product and system design can help achieve p circular economy of nappy wastegraphical abstract abstract article info article history received june received in revised form july accepted july available online july editor frederic coulonthis study assessed the potential for minimizing human excreta bound phosphorus p loss through used dispos able baby nappies an area that remained unexplored for nations accordingly it performed a substance ow analysis to assess the national p loss through used disposable baby nappies in the case of australia the analysis revealed that approximately tonne p is lost through used baby nappies to land lls in australia in which is nearly of the overall p excreta as human waste although the quantity seems small in percentage term it could result in the loss of a signi cant amount of p over several years as assessed tonne p over the period which is concerning in the context of anticipated future global p scarcity the review of peerreviewed literature on available technologiesmethods for recycling disposable baby nappy waste indicates that there are some technologies for recycling p particularly through cocomposting with food and other organic wastes while the majority of these are still at the labpilot scale there are also various recycling techniques with purpose ranging from energy recovery to volume reduction generation of pulp hydrogel cellulose and polymer as well as to increase yield stress and viscosity of concrete however these are not effective in p recovery the study implies that compost made of nappy waste can be used as fertilizer to produce bamboo cotton and maize plants to supply raw materials for producing biodegradable nappies hence to close the loop the various product and system design options eg designing for ushing designing for disassembling the excreta containing part and designing for community composting suggested in this study could be further researched for identifying best suitable option to achieve p circular economy of disposable baby nappies this study also recommends nec essary interventions at various stages of the nappy life cycle to ensure sustainable management of phosphorus e l s e v i e rb v a l lr i g h t sr e s e r v

wwwelseviercomlocatescitotenv introduction phosphorus p is a nonsubstitutable essential element for the growth and survival of all living organisms including plant animal and microorganisms the modern global food production system is heavily reliant on the application of commercial p fertilizers which mainly sourced through the mining of phosphate rock a nonrenewable and geographically restricted resource the dwindling global reserves of phosphate rock with a lifetime of few hundred years is restricted to only a few countries mainly morocco with ap proximately of the global reserves and the majority of the countries rely on p import for food production the increasing de mand of p for producing food for growing global population the dwindling reserves and geopolitical constraints likely to create p scarcity in future and farmers of many countries mainly economi cally poor and developing countries may lose their access to com mercial p fertilizers which may ultimately result in food insecurity chowdhury et al the excessive loss of p from the agricultural and waste management systems to water bodies around the world not only resulting in the depletion of the limited global p resource but also destroying valuable aquatic ecosystems and water resources by causing algal bloom and eutrophication which is clearly evident from many re cent studies chowdhury et al the importance of minimizing p loss from various systems particularly the waste management system for the sustainable management of this limited global resource is well known rahman et al the available substance ow analyses of p indicates that worldwide nearly of the mined p is consumed in human food which ultimately ends up in human excreta cordell et al rahman et al al though the importance of p recovery from human excreta that is col lected and managed through the wastewater collection and treatment systems in many countries was addressed in numerous literature harder et al metson et al the fraction of p in human ex creta that is lost through disposable baby nappies in a country was not assessed in any of the available substance ow analyses of p that pub lished in peer reviewed journals chowdhury et al rahman et al hence there is a clear knowledge gap of understanding the magnitude of p loss through used disposable baby nappies to land ll for nations disposable baby nappies shortened term for baby napkins and referred to as diapers in some countries are the absorbent hygieneproduct that is mainly used by infant and toddlers to retain urine and feces until they are prepared to use a sanitary facility to dispose of human excreta mostly up to to years a snapshot of the compo nentsstructure of commonly used baby nappies as presented by khoo et al is provided in the supplementary fig
