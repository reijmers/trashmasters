of the cross-disciplinary approaches devoted to clean
technologies, process modelling, monitoring and management frameworkIntegration of smart concept in energy, water and waste management could
signiﬁcantly improve environmental performance through the smart sensor
and real-time monitoring. However, there is still a research gap on theoffset/saving versus the footprint of the IT sectorVan Fan et al.,

Developing an integrated design of waste management systems to support
circular economy by P-graph (a bipartite graphical optimization tool)The identi ﬁcation of near-optimal solutions by P-graph is useful in dealing with
the trade-offs between con ﬂicting objectives. Developed framework by
P-graph turned out to be an effective tool for solid waste systems planning.Van Fan et al.,

To gain insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the methodologies
currently being applied, and to identify their applicability to a sustainableCIWMS targeting resource recovery.CIWMS shortcomings can be improved by expansion of the boundaries of
traditional linear IWMS, so that it includes upstream subsystems that will beable to link the conversion of raw materials into MSW with the wastetreatment sub-systems.Cobo et al.,

Reviewing the history of the CE & critical examination of how it is applied
currently.Research on CE concept shows that this initiative requires integrated
bottom-up and top-down approaches for its implementation and evaluation.
Without some evaluation framework or bottom-up support from the industryor the social community, CE initiatives cannot sustain.Winans et al.,

Detailed study about waste generation and treatment on basis of designing
and policy instruments for CE.Database showed that, both high income and low income countries need to
increase their recycling and reduce land ﬁlling to achieve circular economy.Tisserant

Study of classi ﬁcation framework to categorize indicators according to
reasoning on CE strategies and their measurement scopeStudy suggests a set of indicators to be used to assess CE instead of a single
indicator.Moraga et al.,

Review of MSW and waste to energy systems in context of CE in Europe Biggest proportion of waste (above the EU average) was generated in Italy
(486 kg/per capita), Greece, and the UK (each 485 kg/per capita). CE can help
in overcoming this problem.Malinauskaite

Critical analysis of CE in context with WCED sustainable development. CE needs to attract business community as well as policy-making community
to maintain sustainability of work.Korhonen

composition in Dhaka, BangladeshSource segregation needs to consider all other interconnected aspects of the
waste management system that in ﬂ

Evaluation of the impact of MSWM system in Nagpur city, India. Results indicated that the combination of recycling, composting and land ﬁlling
of the residues is the most suitable. Sensitivity analysis also revealed that
environmental impacts have an inverse relation with recycling rate.Khandelwal
