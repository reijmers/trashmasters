3.1. General Analysis
As the main RQ of this review was “What is the current situation in the academic
and practice-based contexts at the intersection of design, materials, extrusion-based ad-
ditive manufacturing, and a circular economy?”, the general analysis aimed to depict
the main framework. At ﬁrst, the study focused on searching for works from the past
eleven years (2010–2021) to depict a general overview. Since only four case studies were
detected from 2010 to 2014, the review was limited to the timeframe from 2015 to 2021.
The lack of eligible case studies in the previous part of the decade may be affected by
the trends’ diffusion- of extrusion-based AM technologies. Only the expiry of the ﬁrst
patents has fostered the development of new 3D printers, materials, and new applications.
Moreover, 3D printing was initially seen as a tool for rapid prototyping rather than a proper
manufacturing process [22].
As visible in Figure 2, 74 works satisﬁed the eligibility criteria. In detail, 31 works were
related to the academic context, whereas 43 projects were found within the practice-based
one. Despite the slight difference, a great interest in both cases is clearly noticeable. The
number of works increased more than ﬁve times between 2018 and 2021, and only nine
works were found in the previous three-year period. A big gap is visible between 2017 and
2018. Only 6 works were found in the former case, whereas 29 works were counted in the
latter year. This may not simply be related to the existence of a restricted number of works
before 2018. As mentioned in the previous section, the eligibility criteria set in this paper
excluded projects and publications without enough data about the applications, materials,
and technologies. Therefore, this could mean that other works or projects can be found,
but the lack of further details did not allow us to consider them in the review.
