University of Souther n Denmark Campusvej Odense M Denmark Abstract Indonesia is facing a number of independently manag ed challenges related to the collection transportation processing composting recycling and landfill dependence on waste management An intervention is needed to b ring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainab le and smart countrywide waste management system The system should provide a mult idimensional approach determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste manageme nt problems A comprehensive systematic literature review intensive focus group discussions and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develo p waste management business processes and their system design Waste business p rocesses consist of mixed collecting sorting transporting variedtreatment and chaineddisposal The design of the proposed waste management system presents circu lar economy processes that can separate municipal waste identify waste characteri stics and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Int ernet of Thing IoT as the integrator This study contributes to the sustainable developme nt goals SDGs such as Good health and wellbeing SDG Clean water and sani tation SDG Decent Work and Economic Growth SDG Responsible Consumption an d Production SDG and Climate Action SDG The study proposes a new design of smart and sustai nable waste management which could achieve satisfactory economi c social and environmental waste management performances Keywords Sustainability Sustainable circular economy Smart waste management Corresponding author China Institute of FTZ Suppl y Chain Shanghai Maritime University Shanghai China kgovitisdudk Maturity model Internet of Thing IoT Sustainable development goals SDGs Introduction Indonesias waste problem creates a critical threat to the sustainability of the nations economy society and our environment The nations enormous waste production demands even more space dedicated to landfills which compe tes with the communitys need for more sustainable sites When landfills become overburden ed excess waste is then burned in open and uncontrolled ways or it is spilled into waterwa ys Both methods increase the risk of disease pollution and hazardous emissions for Ind onesian citizens Further the landfills themselves called Waste Mountains are dangerous a reas because they attract scavengers trash collectors and informal workers Based on research conducted in Jakarta Semarang Yogyakarta and Magelang in the mainstream of municipal waste is collected from households and traditional markets Municipal waste is initially collected at a temporary collection point TPS The TPS is divided into sev eral different area functions R reduce reuse recycle TPS with multicompartments and T PS with waste typebased schedule These divisions are enacted before waste is sent to its f inal disposal centre TPA The majority of waste collection activities are still conducted man ually by both formal and informal sectors Kannan et al A regular schedule is observ ed but there is a limited use of facilities or infrastructure Most collected waste is still mixed and unsorted because most residents do not properly separate waste Based on their characteristics most collected wast e is processed through composting recycling gasification anaerobic digestion or wa stetoenergy systems However this approach has not optimally touched the economic so cial and environmental aspects of the waste management system Regulations for waste management in Indonesia are obvious and sufficient For instance Law No concerns solid waste management Government Regulation No addresses economicoriented household waste management and the ministerial decree of environmental department Act No focuses on reduce reuse recycle actions through the waste bank Further th e Ministerial decree of the Interior No about waste management concerns the involve ment of the community as waste producers in the waste management system Ministeri al decree public work No governs household waste management and Presidentia l regulation No is concerned with household waste national policy and strategy Despite these decrees most waste management systems in Indonesia are still tradition al and conventional Open dumping transferring collecting and landfill are the most common methods of disposal in some urban cities A sustainable waste management system is fa r from standard In short current waste management systems are not yet integrated particip ation from corporations is rare social awareness about environmental cleanliness is limite d and government policies are not yet optimally applied The current waste management system is not able to identify specific characteristics types and amounts of municipal waste collected in the final c ollection centre nor is that system able to provide sufficient accessible reliable accurate or timely information for applying appropriate treatment technologies to manage the wa ste in economically socially and environmentally beneficial ways A comprehensive s ystem intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste problems The use of Information and Communication Technology ICT and the Internet of Things IoT offer a new generation approach to improve the glob al waste management system effectively and efficiently in developed countries The ICTIoT integration consists of the use of local sensing data integration analytics of things and cognitive action in the area of waste management Waste activity could be realtime track ed and monitored to enable an efficient and effective waste management and to transform lar ge and complex waste characteristics to become valuable resource materials and energy Ad am Okasha Tawfeeq Margan Nasreldeen Anagnostopoulos et al Gut irrez et al The research questions we plan to explore include What is the current waste management system in Indo nesia At what level of maturity is the current system a nd What appropriate approaches and strategies are need ed to achieve the expected level This research has developed an innovative assessmen t to measure the existing performance of the waste management system and we have developed a sustainable and smart waste management system based on the maturity level of th e current system The sustainable and smart waste management system provides a better dec isionmaking process and policy supports appropriate treatment technologies optim al waste and resource recovery methods which helps to achieve sustainable development goal s SDGs It uses minimal virgin materials and low energy consumption low environmental degra dation and pollution and it supports highly skilled workers as it enhances social values The remainder of this paper continues as follows S ection presents the materials and methods Section outlines the results Section analyses and discusses these results through our case study Section summarises the conclusions Materials and Methods The objectives of this study are to investigate the issues and opportunities of developing a country wide waste management system in the industrial revo lution era We also seek to design a sustainable and smart waste management system with a multidimensional approach to present the maturity level of the waste management system in it s technical method and to design a new approach of sustainable and smart waste management for Indonesian urban cities Partially the IOT and ICT development and implementation in the waste management value change is concerned The study consists of the following steps a Case study in four urban cities of Indonesia ie Jakarta Magelang Semarang Yogyakarta These cities were selected on the basi s that they have applied the smart city program through the implementation of smart environ ment which also is concern with waste management they have also agreed to particip ate in the study b Direct observation of both final and temporary disp osal centres and landfill areas of the four cities and the waste management value chain inclu ding collection selection

identified to understand the contributions of previous research Furthermore an indepth research on current waste management and its treatment technology in Indonesia was conducted for years to date The results gained from this research were collected to determine the current maturity positio n of the sustainable waste management in Indonesian cities A number of regulations policie s and strategies applied by the local and national governments were intensively discussed for better f uture approach Results Research method implementation This research consists of several stages including determining the research questionnaire developing case studies determining the maturity l evel developing multidimensions of sustainable and smart waste management and analysing the gap t o determine the current maturity level of each city we investigated The maturity levels of the cu rrent waste management are ultimately used to develop a newly designed smart waste management sys tem Case study on urban cities As mentioned in the previous section we interviewe d in four urban cities Semarang Magelang Yogyakarta Jakarta and to various stakeholders s cavengers waste collection agencies community recycling industry Individuals were i nterviewed regarding the existing performance of their waste management and future opportunities From these five main question areas specific openended questions were formulated The questions were given to respondents at the four cities through direct interview mails and communication The results of the direct interview and communication are presented as follows Semarang waste management Semarang is the capital city of Central Java Jatib arang is the centre of waste disposal area of Semarang City To reduce the amount of waste the S emarang Government uses a R strategy under the national regulation number about waste management Integrated waste management is located in the centre of Semarang City and is contr olled by the Environmental Department There are two waste management facilities that belong to Semarang City a final disposal centre TPA at Jatibarang Kedungpane and Mijen and a temporary disposal centre TPST at Jatisari Mijen The TPA was built in and still has years to be u sed The area of TPA is about ha and the usable area is about ha Sanitary landfill is the operation system conducted in the TPA To manage the liquid waste created the TPA is facilit ated with leachate IPAL disposal zone drainage and operation line gate and the development of met hane CH for household gas and electricity energy The distance from the community area is abo ut km away the distance to the nearest water body is km and the distance to the beach is k m away The waste management operation in the TPA is under the DELH environment regulation and i t is managed by the Environment and Life Department On the other side the TPST was built i n under the Analysis of Environment Management protection To manage the waste the ope ration system segregates the waste and runs composting The total area of the TPST is about ha and the use of the area is about ha The distance from TPST to community area is about km the distance from TPST to water body is km and the distance from TPST to beach is km I nstead of a governmental department as overseer the waste collector industry and scavenge rs are two main informal elements involved in the waste management system in Semarang It is foun d that the average waste collector is able to collect about kg waste per day while scavengers collect kg per day Waste management is conducted by Government Environmental Agency by the help of PT Narpati which changes the organic waste into granule compost and secondly c hanges the organic waste into refusederived fuel The final collection centre is at Jatibarang with the area size of ha Methane gas created from the waste is distributed to the commun ity as cooking gas Through cooperation with Denmark it is expected to generate about MW of electricity Nonvaluable waste is dumped and managed using sanitary landfill the waste is cover ed with land The waste generated in Semarang is organic and inorganic Waste volume is abo ut tonsday and the capacity of the waste management in the TPA is tonsday The f low of waste starts from community level waste collection then is sent to TPS using communi ty vehicles and finally sent to TPA by the environmental agency trucks There are about TP S located in the Semarang area The type of waste consists of plastic steel rubber paper fo od waste garden greens and dry branches Magelang waste management The waste management system is still a big problem for Greater Magelang including Magelang City and Magelang Regency Waste generation in Magelang City reaches kg per person per day while Magelang Regency generates kg per person per day in This creates a significant amount of waste tons per year for Magelang City and tons of waste per year for Magelang Regency Organic waste in Magelang City is about of the total waste while organic waste for Magelang Regency is about of the tota l waste Waste management servicing management collection processing is regularly co nducted by the citys and regencys Environmental Agency every day The City of Magelan g has no waste disposal centre due to its limited area Currently waste from the city munici pal is sent to a final disposal centre that belongs to Regency of Magelang TPS is the temporary collec tion centre transfer station in which waste is separated into recycled waste TPS R and nonrecy cled waste The city has TPS R and transfer stations The environmental agency of the city has employees for managing the waste while the environmental agency of the regency has employees Threewheeled motors pickup cars and trucks are transportation vehicles used i n both cities The waste treatment technologies applied in the city consist of composting leachate treatment landfill gas collection However limited technology human resources and financial support to provide appropriate treatment technology are a big challenge for Magelang City to manage their waste sustainably In addition many informal sectors including scavengers and pri vate waste collectors work independently in unhealthy and dangerous workplaces Yogyakarta waste management The waste management system in Yogyakarta or called Jogja is conducted by two Agencies including the Provincial Environmental Agency and t he Regional Development Agency Regulations stem from local government decree numbe r about waste management The waste is collected from the community and then sent to a temporary collection centre before it is sent to a final collection centre The contribution s of waste generation in Yogyakarta come from municipal hospital hotel and tourism areas othe r city waste collected and managed by the Environment Service Agency is about tonsday or about trucks daily The number of labourers involved in the waste management is about individuals consisting of technicians government labourers segregators and no ngovernment labourers There are also about scavengers and cows at the final waste coll ection centre TPA The primary challenge faced by Yogyakarta waste management system is a la ck of community awareness on waste management The final disposal centre is a regional TPA in which waste comes from Sleman Yogyakarta City and Bantul The TPS is not fairly distributed to Yogyakarta area A lot of waste comes from Sleman and its surr ounding area Waste is mounting steadily in the Yogyakarta TPA Technically the waste sent to TPA from TPS uses truck deliveries and the labour is hours standing by to clean the TPS Th e waste in TPS is not nonorganic the most waste is residue The number of depots is abou t units Cow farming in the waste area belongs to the community Disposal waste costs abou t million per month for thousand tons The citys budget per year is billion Total exp enditures of billion consider about billion for waste and billion for fuels The benefit ret ribution is about billion and it is returned to community at a rate of about The community is charged for waste collection activity with a current rate of about thousand to million rup iahfamily Jakarta waste management Waste management in Jakarta is conducted by the Pro vincial Environmental Service Agency with large areas landfilled without a treatment facility In Jakarta sanitary landfilling takes place The landfill area known as Pyramid has developed simp le water treatment installation IPAS technology through water filtering from waste Powe rhouseelectricity booths that convert methane to electricity are available Composting from tradi tional market waste produces tons of compostday Bantar Gebang is the integrated waste processing site for Jakarta city Jakarta produces nearly more than million tons of waste annually and this amount increases annually it is expected to exceed the waste manage ment capacity by The main waste in Jakarta is organic waste which comprises about of the total waste It is predicted that by the volume of waste in Jakarta will reach thous and tonsday Household municipal waste is the largest waste source followed by traditional marke ts To improve waste management Jakartas government has introduced some ecotechnology throu gh TPST TPST R and intermediate waste facilities composting and waste banks Waste to E nergy is one potential treatment technology project planned to reduce Jakartas waste Stateoftheart sustainable and smart waste m anagement A literature review of current organic waste manage ment and treatment technology for developed countries including US Canada Mexico Australia NZ Japan and the European Union found that the waste management and treatment technology is ra pidly improving with more efficiency and greater environmentally sound practices Developed countries place greater emphasis on the advantages of modern engineered landfills recyclin g technology incineration mechanical biological treatment MBT and anaerobic digestion Other emerging countries such as China India and Asian countries Indonesia Malaysia Ph ilippines emphasise composting limited incineration MBT and anaerobic digestion Artiola Damanhuri et al IA Jereme Siwar Alam Islam Hannan Arebey Basri Jouhara et al Tchobanoglous Theisen Vigil Woodard Curran Inc Those waste management and treatment technologies offer some benefits including economi c affordable social new job safety and environmental low GHG emission to manage the wast e Waste management is a complex activity that not only concerns disposal activity but also focuses on collection systems transportation temporary storage processing and disposal Instea d of strictly implementing R strategy developed nations like US UK Australia and Japan have applied advanced methods of waste collection such as underground waste collection sys tems Geographic information system GIS technology solid waste bin monitoring system using GSM technology and indooroutdoor waste compactors Wajeeha Ayesha Muneeba Fatima Gha zala Yoshida Yoshida Underground waste collection system is a new techno logy of waste storage that replaces technologies such as waste bins with underground co llection points for collecting recyclables organic wastes and oils The technology is suitabl e for extremely hot climates requires less maintenance and is more aesthetically acceptable GIS technology is an integrated application dedicated to individual or association municipaliti es to manage optimally and automatically each phase of the waste entire chaincycle from waste pr oduction point to recyclingtreatment point or final disposal point landfill The latest techno logy for waste collection and monitoring is Global System of Mobile GSM Hannan Arebey Basri Be gum This technology uses sensors that are placed in public garbage bins to assess th e optimal level of waste inside of the bin Misra Das Chakrabortty Das When the garbage t ouches the threshold level through SMS using GSM the sensor will send an indication to co ntroller and further sends an indication to the collection truck driver to collect garbage immediat ely Compact garbage collection trucks are the latest technology used by many developing countries in order to increase the collection capacity of vehicles Due to narrow roads some waste compactor s are designed in small collection trucks using lightweight materials for optimising the load capac ity Along with the development and implementation of sm art city technologies and platforms new solutions for intelligent waste collection and sort ing are being developed While an intelligent garbage collection system using information technol ogy and computers is still in its initial phase Smart Bins have begun to be used to collect garbage Smart Bins are trash bins equipped with ultrasonic sensors with the function of measuring t he space of the trash can A sensor gateway uses the WLAN protocol and the collection analysis an d visualization of junk data uses the cloud platform Some literature presents IoT platforms fo r waste management such as Zanella and Vangelista who present IoT platform solutions for t he smart city with a case study on the city of Padova Zanella Bui Castellani Vangelista Zor zi In Romania the garbage collection system for the historic city centre of Sibiu was de veloped based on several parameters garbage volume which is variable due to seasonal events composition of waste source concentration current infrastructure distance from the source a nd the level of public attention Ciudin et al In Sweden the automatic waste collection sy stem is limited to four types of waste general waste organic waste recycled paper and cardboard This system cannot collect WEEE batteries light bulbs and fluorescent lamps hard sheets gla ss receivers etc Bernstad La Cour Jansen Aspegren The further step one that is very important in was te management is known as waste processing Autoclaving fluffing and melting technology are t he latest technologies for waste processing Gao Li Autoclaving technology applies steam t reatment to the waste at degrees C for minutes in order to sterilize the waste and then the residue can be screened In this process waste is separated on the basis of weight while gl ass and dirt are removed from organic fibres and metals and plastics are sent to the recycle process The organic fibre is used for land applications and RefuseDerived Fuel RDF production Sarc Lo rber Fluffing is a waste processing technology in which the solid waste is separated an d sterilized and the organic portion is processed to become pulp material known as fluff This techno logy produces fluff rich with organic base and high nitrogen A lot of western countries adopt thi s technology with some recycling rates achieving of total waste The next current technology exa mined by both developed and developing countries is melting technology which can melt the waste through fuel and electricity combustion to reduce the waste volume This technology is bett er than incineration as it solves the fly ash problem and stabilises metal portions Incineration technology is a thermal waste treatment in which untreated waste is burned at a high temperatu re Some European countries UK have applied this technology to process their waste The Japanes e have introduced a new incineration technology which is pollutant free by recycling ash and removi ng the acidic gases through a control technology Vermi composting is the latest common t echnology used by Japan and UK in which animal pharmaceutical food and sewage wastes are transformed through earthworms into vermi wash which contains high nitrogen phosphate and p otassium contents Energy recovery technology is the last phase before disposal proces s in which all waste residues are inaugurated for a renewable energy alternative This technology con sists of bio and thermal conversion technologies Thermal conversion is waterheat pres sure utilised technology that converts organic and inorganic waste plastics computer tires int o useful chemicals and compounds through a thermal processing system The next technology is a dvanced thermal treatment technologies which include pyrolysis gasification and excluded incin eration Pyrolysis converts waste to liquid or gaseous fuels together with the residue which is a combination of noncombustible material and carbon Gasification presents partial oxidation of a substance which occurs between combustion and pyrolysis Gasification products are similar to pyrolysis and include syngas and low C ash Gasification is economically and environmentally so und technology to maintain landfill sustainability Biofuel can also be produced from f ood waste through a variety of fermentation processes Currently hydrogen ethanol biodiesel and biogas are produced by using valorization which is a thermopile process without biogas recirc ulation involved Artiola Millard Ministry of the Environment Srivastava Tisserant et al Wajeeha et al The last step of waste management system is the dis posal process in which the invaluable waste that comes from residue of trash recycling and ot her treatment technology is disposed As disposal is the most technical step some advanced technolog ies are urgently required to be developed Most disposal sites in developing countries are still op en dumps without appropriate leachate treatment and landfill gas utilization therefore they cause many aesthetic and other environmental issues Landfill is an efficiently engineered depression in low population area for final disposal In this depression the waste is buried to avoid any hydrau lic relation between trash and environment air and water Bioreactor is one of the latest technol ogies to process waste disposed The objective of bioreactor is to improve the decomposition rate le achate circulation and microbial growth The conventional landfill technology is used to dry the waste The latest technology is to generate electricity from waste through micro turbines whic h are optimally applied to small scale projects The technology can reduce the issue of pollution an d emissions of landfill gas air The Indonesian sanitary landfill a major disposal activity is de signed as monitored landfill However the waste source is operated under an open dumping system whi ch creates serious environmental problems Bronson Pariatamby A Tanaka Rawl ins Beyer Lampreia Tumiwa H Sudibyo et al Developing Multidimensions of Sustainable and Smart Waste Management Sustainability has become a topic of debate and it is a target achievement for many countries Govindan et al a Also sustainability turn into a fundamental part of waste management Sustainable waste management is a circular feedback system which concerns process activities adaptability and the diversity of waste from manuf acturing to disposal phase Seadon Industrial Revolution has brought significant c hanges in global waste management and value changes Chen Wang Huang Huang Tsai T hat framework consists of five aspects including governance economy social environmenta l and technological Through the implementation of IOT digitalization and ICT achieving sustainability in waste management is becoming more possible reliable tra nsparent efficient and optimum in the industrial revolution era IOT and ICT applicat ions can help reduce the time and resources required to provide better performance of waste man agement toward sustainable and smart systems Abdullah Alwesabi Abdullah Therefore the use of IOT digitalization and ICT in waste management is an interesting pursuit because it brings more economic social and environmental opportunities for waste businesses S mart waste management presents an automatic integrated and connected system and provides great economic opportunities for municipalities waste industries and the community in the fields o f collection eg route optimization segregation eg waste identification and treat ments eg recycling remanufacturing reconditioning Abdullah et al Antikainen Uusitalo KivikytReponen However there are several challenges faced by Indo nesia in achieving sustainable and smart waste management Those challenges include financial supp orts technical capabilities political conditions institutional capacities and social is sues Aprilia Tezuka Spaargaren Damanhuri Handoko Padmi Hanifrahmawan Su dibyo et al In these cities waste management cost is high while the revenue or incom eprofit gathered from the waste management process is low An ideal framework should provide a better solution that represents higher economic value by optimising waste management and treatment technology and facilities The other challenge is a lack of information and data about r eal waste management cost requirements as they apply to their processes and technologies Further more the amount of waste sent to landfills increases the cost of waste management A secondary challenge is the lack of technicallyskilled local people and government staff who can practice effective and efficient waste management and treatment The quality of the waste itself because it is mostly mixed dirty is another challenge for Indonesian waste management If the waste is mixed and dirty it requires special treatment to separate the various components and to make them re ady to be processed Therefore it is important to apply waste collectio n activities in the beginning process of waste at the source In addition the availability of an int egrated clear and transparent waste management process and sufficient information are both critica l elements to achieve ultimate value and to minimise the cost of the waste management system A nother objective of the waste management system is to improve the populations social perfor mance and the community by reducing the impacts of waste Social impacts include the desire to minimise the decline of the environment and to improve the cleanliness and health of the commun ity to augment conservation efforts and to provide labour opportunities for employment The hu ge amount of waste sent to landfills shows that community awareness of the importance of waste redu ction is still low In addition the work opportunity given to scavengers waste pickers oft en risks the health and safety of that individual due to lack of waste facilities Greater attention to health and safety issues and more informed participation and cooperation from citizens and the public is needed to make waste management socially viable Good governance plays a key role i n smart waste management However implementing sustainable waste management requires participation from both political and other official stakeholders Appropriate regulations tec hnology selections ICT and infrastructure development and effective waste management operati ons need local and national government participation and coordination A fundamental framework of the circular sustainabl e and smart waste management is developed through the value chain process of waste management That circular process use selection sorting technical recovery biological recovery energy rec overy and landfill Kannan et al Govindan et al b is illustrated in Fig T he four dimensions of governance economic social and environment become the drivers in the f ramework Information and data management through IOT and ICT intervention is located at the centre of the system Internet of things IoT a new generation technology is applied in this syste m for information and data integration sharing and connection in the waste management value chain The concept of IoT consists of local sensing data integration analytics of things and cognitiv e action In the area of waste management the IoT could provide track waste identification in real ti me Connected devices allow for the tracking of products components and materials and that promo tes efficiency in recovery and reuse of the waste Fig Fundamental framework of Sustainable and Smart Wast e Management System Fig shows how the ICT and IOT are designed as th e core of the waste management system The waste management system is integrated through the e stablishment of appropriate IOT and IOT infrastructures in which some automatic technologi es are adopted to improve the productivity and efficiency of the waste system The ICT and IOT sol utions should be uniquely aligned with social economic and environmental aspects and they should maximise the benefits of the system Details of the framework and each aspect are elabor ated below Also explained is how these aspects relate to each other and a categorization of the l evels of their subaspect Each dimension has several subdimensions that has different characteri stics as presented in Table Table Sustainable Smart Waste Management

stru ctured levels from the lowest level to the highest level which describes how good the government organisati on business community and technology manage waste from five points of view including gov ernance social economy technological and environmental dimensions Each dimension has severa l components as illustrated in the following section Governance dimension There are three maturity levels differentiated in t he Governance perspective low mediocre and advanced Low gover nance refers to a basic governance performance which is characterized by an unforced l egal waste management system and the society is not involved in the public waste management syst em Mediocre governance is considered adequate or average performance generally one fin ds contemporary values and practices of public waste management in existence Advanced governance is the way waste management is managed in the highestlevel organizations Advanced governanc e works coherently with discipline and accountability and it involves participation from all stakeholders Social dimension Social dimension is strongly related to people their life and interactions which are an essential part of th e sustainability of waste management The social dime nsion considers five maturity levels legal organizational technological management and proce dure and human competency Legal waste management is operated under institutional and lega l processes by the local government and it is based on national regulations and policies The org anizational level demonstrates that waste management is operated by an organization with a fo rmal structure which has goals at the level strategic to be achieved The technological level r efers to the implementation of technology to boost labour productivity of waste management Management and procedure shows how the workflow in the waste management process operates The fifth ma turity level in the social dimension consists of human competencies Waste management occurs due to the work of a set of labourers or skilled people with specific characteristics their skills enable the efficiency of the systems job performance Economic dimension Three maturity levels including slow fast and ad vanced are present in the economic dimension A slow economy p revents or hinders the receipt of economic value or benefits from the waste management busines s process When economic values decrease or stagnate business processes tend to be unprofitabl e A fast maturity level refers to a real verifiab le growth in the waste business which can be measured An increase in investments in the waste management business contributes to a healthy econom ic development and an increase in the labour force technology and human capital are reasonable expectations The advanced maturity level refers to highest level of economy performance avai lable in the system This waste management is more developed and features advanced technologies infrastructure and facilities Importantly an advanced economy waste management system is able to significantly transform waste into valuable money Technological dimension Technology has three maturity levels common varie ty and diverse Common technology is known easily availab le and commonly used in waste management Variety means that the technology or system applied in the waste management has different types categories of collection transportation and treatm ent technologies A diverse technological level is the highest level of sustainability and it shows a great deal of variety these technologies are different

human and environmental impacts Fig presents the multidimensional sustainable smart wa ste management Fig Multidimensional Sustainable and Smart Wast e Management Framework In addition we identified five maturity stages of waste management including traditional common organised integrated and smart all of which are scored in Table The maturity level of the waste management will depend on the score assessment whic h was adjusted for relevant intervals based on the scale linkers used in this study A waste ma nagement will be categorised or ranked as traditional if it scores common if the syste m scores organised if it ranks integrated with a score between and smart fo r ranking Table Score card of the maturity levels ScoreDimension Traditional Common Organised Integrated Smart Governance Economic Social Environmental Technological Total The stages are determined based on the performance of the governance economic social environment and technological aspects of the syste m These five maturity stages are outlined in the following section Level Traditional The traditional waste management system involves li mited facilities and technology with minimum machinery and automation I t is mostly manually operated and no standard process and procedure exists Regulations are applied at the very basic standard to meet government requirements and there is little partic ipation from the community and citizens Further there is a lack of communication between municipal departments The ICT investment is limited to the use of SMS alerts for waste data confirmation there is a lack of skilled workers a lack of regulation compliance and no communication channel s between departments Key approaches for reaching a higher level include stakeholder identif ication and involvement management improvements that focus on technology applications and building a citizen and community base Level Common The waste management is addressed to meet waste regulat ions with a primary focus on accessibility to the collection process w aste management is set to be semiautomatically operated There is communication between department s to handle the waste however there is still a lack of coordination between stakeholders ICT ap plications are used for basic communication and regulations drive the waste management process A minimum number of skilled workers are employed Key directives for achieving a better was te management system are grounded on changing community behaviour and cultures implemen ting basic automatic machinery and technology complying with minimum regulations imp roving basic communication channels and augmenting environmental awareness Finally improv ing awareness of policies and regulations and adding relevant information on waste management system processes and procedures is needed Level Organised The waste management has an efficient streamlined eff ective waste process with average skilled workers total regulation comp liance established communication channels between department some community participation a nd some participantmanagement levels demonstrated in the environmental awareness of empl oyees Key approaches to augment an organised system should focus on improvements in co mmunity behaviour knowledge and skills of waste workers through both formal and informal educ ation promoting worker productivity through automation and improved monitoring ICT investments a website to disseminate and to promote waste management activities and to share pertinent information such as pick up services and new regulations The expected level of the current wast e management performance in the four cities is organised since smart cities including those wit h smart environments have achieved the integrated level Level Integrated This waste management system is modern and is align ed with the behaviour of the people this system is comprehensively and i ntensively integrated to reduce global waste This system employs standard skilled workers opera tes beyond regulatory compliance presents a high level of communication and transparency and i nvolves all management levels in a culture that values environmental awareness Key approaches here rest on collaborating or contracting with the recycling industry changing management structure data integration and boosting community engagement and participation Level Smart The smart waste management system is globally conne cted through the entire system Waste treatment values are considered in de cision making automatic technology and systems are employed to achieve efficiency waste d ata and information are integrated in big data centres using IoT systems workers are highly skill ed the community is naturally involved insurance or other initiatives are

current waste management sys tem Despite positive maturity levels that exist in the governance social and economy dimensions of waste management the maturity levels in the enviro nment and technology dimensions are still at a low position Fig shows the data gathered from t he survey conducted in the urban cities which assesses the environmental aspects of the waste man agement Ultimate amount of wastes processed recycled and composted is far from the threshold va lue The other aspects including waste management value change and carbon emission of proc ess still have low level These issues cause the waste management to produce high environmental impacts which negatively degrade not only the ecosystem but also risk human health and life Therefore the waste management stakeholders and Indonesian government need to take an innovativ e approach to improve environmental conditions They need to work effectively and effic iently on the waste process recycling and treatment at the onsite waste operations and waste supply chains The investment into infrastructure and facilities is also critical to be improved in o rder to optimize waste treatment and to reduce hazardous emissions Fig Maturity level of the waste management syste m for environmental aspects Fig illustrates the technological maturity level s of the current waste management The maturity level that use appropriate technology apply ICT an d IOT implement automated technologies and efficient energy consumption are still at a low lev el Essentially the use of automation and ICT plays a critical role in achieving sustainability o f economic social and environmental aspects of th e waste management Therefore the Indonesian Governm ent needs to invest more in innovative technologies to improve waste management practices in Indonesia In addition improvement of knowledge and skills of the labour force in order t o maximise the use of technologies is urgently required Fig Maturity level of the waste management

play a more po sitive impact than the other aspects Therefore to understand how the framework is applied in the wast e management system a sustainable and smart waste management design focusing on the business pr ocess and system workflow of the final disposal centre is developed and presented in the f ollowing section Business process in Final Disposal Centre The business process is the preliminary design of t he proposed waste management system presenting a sequence of waste flow in a waste mana gement system separating waste based on some characteristics including size metalnonmeta l light inert and combustible etc grouping the waste material and making decisions for the appropr iate treatment technology This phase involves a preliminary design of the proposed system by dev eloping a waste classification system sorting systems based on waste type and characteristics in a sequenced waste flow The sorting systems that consist of filters are developed via standard methods of waste classification presented in Fig Governance Economy Social Environment Technology threshold Jakarta Magelang Semarang Yogyakarta Fig Business process of the proposed system The st filter is a waste sorting system that disag gregates the waste into large size materials and small size materials through a semimanual automat ic system The semimanual system applies labour work and sensors to separate the dangerous m aterials ie batteries bottles and glass materials and quilt and cloth materials A rotatin g screening machine separates the materials into largesized materials and smallsized materials Th e nd filter is a waste sorting system which disaggregates the nonmetal and metal materials for both largesized materials and smallsized materials through different belt conveyors using a magnetic separator The system uses the belt conveyors for subsequent operation from filter to f ilter The nd filter disaggregates remaining waste material into three materials including ligh t materials inert materials and combustible materials using wind separators and belt conveyors The th stage is a collection phase based on material characteristics in which all separated wa ste materials are grouped and shifted into differen t waste compartmentsbins and wait for the choice of further treatment Following this stage the system determines the appropriate treatment technol ogy which is technically economically environmentally feasible for the specific waste mat erial The possible treatment technology could be recycling composting incineration incineratio n gasification landfill etc Information communication technology ICT and Internet of thin gs IoT components are integrated in the system to collect analyse and share the informati on system during the system processing The IT devices such as sensors microcontroller equators lowpower connectivity are used to provide all waste management process information and performa nce of the waste management system A software interface includes the embedded applicatio n that is used to support the various functions of the system and a web server and database and a das hboard will be developed for better analysing and reporting This system is expected to be able t o measure the waste level content volume characteristics and amount using sensors which are presented in the dashboard system This system will have three main features which are sensing mo nitoring and optimising the waste management By using this dashboard real time monitoring bett er decision making and appropriate treatment technology can be provided by the company to achiev e economically socially and environmentally sound waste management System Workflow at Final Disposal Centre This system is addressed for municipal waste produc ed from household waste shops and markets construction areas hotels institutions street sw eeping and so forth The system will start with th e flow of invaluable municipal waste produced by th e city community and sent to final disposal centre by a compactor truck that has a barcode on i t This barcode not only identifies the truck but also provides information such as company name sou rce of waste and type of waste Once the truck enters the arrival pit a sensor reads the tr uck barcode and sends the truck identity informatio n to a database The truck is then scaled using a wei ght scale that is connected to the company database through a local area network The weight o f waste will appear on the dashboard The truck dumps the municipal waste into a storage pit that i s embedded to the system A mechanical machine such as a grasp crane will take the waste into manual sorting platform through belt conveyors for first sorting process wh ich is conducted by labourers to sort dangerous materials bottles large glasses and cotton and c loths for recycling purposes The materials from this first stage sorting are collected in certain b ins with weight sensor on it The waste that remai ns on the conveyor is sent to a bag breaker bag break ing machine to break open the refuse bag The broken bag waste is fed into the rotate screen rot ating screening machine that is designed like a tub with specific dimensions In this hole the wast e is separated into different sizes large or small sizes Largesized materials are expected to be mo stly plastic stone textile rubber while the smallsized materials are expected to be mostly org anic waste The small size material is collected by the small collecting belt conveyor and transferr ed by the small transfer belt conveyor to the small material storage for further processing or la ndfill During this process the magnetic separator has sep arated the ironmetal materials in the small materials The largesized material has the same p rocess with smallsized materials process on different belt conveyors After separating the iron metal by the magnetic separator the large materials bigger than the dimension standard are sorted out and the remaining waste is transferred into the wind separator by belt conveyor The wind separator will be designed by a combination of positive and negative pressures which can efficient ly separate the waste into three materials including light materials plastic paper inert m aterials brick stone ceramic chip glass and combustible materials hard plastic textile rubbe r materials wet paper matters The inert material s and combustible materials will be transferred by be lt conveyor to the inert materials and combustible materials storage that are utilised wit h a weight level sensor Useful elements will be identified through a sensor in the sorting platform and they are then sent through a conveyor into a storage bin for further treatment The useless mate rial is collected in a specific bin and then sent t o landfill The light materials will be transferred t o the storage bin and then packed into mass materials which are easy for storage and transporta tion Each of the storage bins includes a weight level se nsor which will send information to the database All information related to the waste flow process i n the system will be sent and recorded in the database The database will provide possible treatm ent technology according to the performance of the waste collected and available treatment technol ogy A feasibility analysis of the economic social and environmental benefits will be provided to help in the decision making For example the collected plastic is possible to be converted into carbon black fuel oil and combustible gas through pyrolysis while inert materials such as muck rubb le construction debris ashes brick and stone can be used for making brick Composting is also po ssible to be applied from the biomass garden food waste and animal while collected metal can b e tagged for recycling Finally the hard plastic textile rubber materials wet paper materials can be used for combustion The following Fig presents the waste flow data flow and logical dec ision making of the proposed system Fig Workflow Design of the Sustainable and Smart Waste Management System The proposed system presents some fundamental agent s including information on the truck weight scale collection and segregating room conveyors hazardous bins tumbler heavy materials compartment light material compartment final wast e material bins accomplished with specific attributes and procedures The agent truck has spe cific capacity with a standard weight The agent truck has a barcode identifying the company name d river source of waste fromto and waste type The agent weight scale measures the weight of the waste truck and a sensor placed at the entrance will help to identify the truck informatio n from the barcode The information is sent to the database of the waste collection centre The agent conveyor will transfer all waste from the segregating area to next station Manual filtering process for hazardous materials will be conducted by labourers during the transfer process Unpacked waste is filtered and returned to segregating facility for reprocessingrepacking Hazardous bin s are used to collect the dangerous materials The bins have sensors which measure the level of the wa ste in which the waste information will be sent to the database The waste is then sent to agent ro tating screening machine agent bag breaking machine agent manual platforms agent magnet separ ator and agent wind separator The sensor will help to provide sufficient data and informatio n of the waste to be further processed composing recycling gasification etc Furthermore a web application is used to deliver a ll information and data of waste flow input process and output from the web page to the desktop or mobile device The illustration of web application a dashboard system is presented in Fi g The dashboard provides the overall status of waste management including the flow process of wast e amount and weight of waste collected the total materials collected the compartments status full or empty for each process the facility map showing the status of the compartments the suitabl e treatment technology for the waste collected and the amount of waste residue sent to landfill Fig Dashboard system of the waste management SDGs Potential Achievements This work contributes to at least five potential Su stainable Development Goals SDGs out of seventeen goals Details of the achievement of thos e five goals created from waste management are described below SDG Good health and wellbeing A good clean and healthy environment is an essent ial component of sustainable development globally In recognition of this concern SDG can be achieved through the following checkbld The proposed smart and sustainable waste management system is one innovation that has potential solutions to solve the issues of waste management i n the community and industry The ability to manage waste properly and to conduct waste treatment appro priately in the proposed waste management system offers direct and indirect advantages to the good clean and healthy environment of the global population which would generate a significant cont ribution to sustainable development SDG Clean water and sanitation A strong interrelation exists between waste and wat er in the waste management system This new waste management system uses various treatment tech nologies to transform waste into valuable materials and resources which could significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill The reduction of the toxins residues emissions and po llution created from waste could correspondingly reduce the water contamination in the land SDG Decent work and economy growth Instead of working unofficially a lot of waste man agement workers ie scavengers waste collectors are underpaid have little education a nd are not properly protected Such unsafe conditions seriously endanger their lives health and social condition Most of them are among the povertystricken in Indonesia This new system prov ides lowincome people a better wage more respect and a better social life by involving them as an important contributor to a formal waste management system Through such a system this work er group will be designated as parttime employees of the Government and their economic per formance will be strengthened SDG Responsible consumption and production One of the SDG targets is reducing pollution emiss ions waste through waste prevention reduction recycling and reuse This new system offers approp riate automated and integrated waste collection separation and treatments which could significantly reduce these environmental problems SDG Climate action Optimising waste collection segregating waste at t he source applying appropriate treatment technology and reducing waste headed to the landfi ll are essential activities These actions allow waste to be controlled and monitored and using ICT and IOT in this system will reduce CO emissions generated from the waste This solution w ill help mitigate aspects of climate change In short when SDGs are achieved not only are envi ronmental aspects improved but economic and social aspects are also enhanced Conclusion In this article we present a new waste management system that is an essential part of our ongoing research objective to design a smart waste management system to implement a sustainable circular economy According to maturity level of th e existing waste management system in four urban cities in Indonesia a sustainable and waste management framework and sustainable and waste disposal system was developed By using the I CT as the core of the system this system finds the capability of existing performance in waste man agement in which realtime smart flexible and reliable waste management performance and infor mation covering governance economic social and environmental dimensions can be achieve d At last this study contributes to the sustainable development goals such as Good health and wellbeing SDG Clean water and sanitation SDG Decent Work and Economic Growth SDG Responsible Consumption and Production SDG and Climate Action SDG Th e use of ICT and IoT improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the waste managemen t system despite having some technical challenges such as limited type of sensors complex ity of system and limited mechanical technology all of which are to be overcome before product development Future research is to improve validity and reliability of the instruments for data gathering The number of characteristics used in this study is only so more criteria is expected to be added to strengthen the classificati on of waste management maturity levels and to improve the determination of thresholds
