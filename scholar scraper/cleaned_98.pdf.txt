RESEARCH ARTICLE Coproduction in solid waste management analyses of emerging cases and implications for circular economy in Nigeria Obiora B EzeuduTochukwu C OraelosiJonah C AgunwambaUzochukwu C Ugochukwu Received November Accepted May The Authors under exclusive licence to SpringerVerlag GmbH Germany part of Springer Nature Abstract Coproduction is a paradigm shift from the traditional model of public policymaking and service delivery that advocates for the involvement and participation of endusers of services as copartaker in the process In this paper we examined the emerging models of coproduction in solid waste management in Nigeria using a case study methodology Four cases were purposefullyselected for detailed exploration The results of the analysis show that the involvement of the plurality of the nonstate actors in waste management coproduction brought in innovation through ICT financial resources through grants and increased public awareness And have also given the service receivers a change of orientation that makes them perceive waste as a source ofincome rather than all rubbish needed to be discarded However possible exploitation of informal waste pickers unclear business models and absence of prior arrangement for coming together of both state and nonstate actors in designing the service production are challenges to the emerging coproduction cas es The current study further shows that the emerging co production efforts have huge potential in promoting circular economy as it creates a better avenue for the implementation of extended producer responsibility EPR the establishment of ecoindustrial parks and safe integration of informal waste recyclers Keywords Waste disposal Waste recycling Informal waste picking Resource recovery Waste Policy Waste reuse Introduction Municipal solid waste is a pervasive urban development chal lenge of the twentyfirst century plaguing both developed anddeveloping societies Poorly managed solid waste constitutes a source of potential threat to environmental sustainability and public health Hoornweg and BhadaTata As such its management has become a major issue of deliberation among policymakers researchers governments businesses and even international organizations One major factor thatproblematizes solid waste is the issue of material and resource requirements that characterize its management which entails incurring both capital and recurrent expenditure Capital ex penditure is required in terms of procuring waste managementfacilities such as compactor vehicles recycling equipment and landfill construction Recurrent expenditures are in the form of costs for fuelling vehicular equipment payment ofstaff salary and so on Because of these associated material and financial burdens providing efficient waste management delivery cannot often be adequately carried out by state actorsespecially in low and middleincome countries where eco nomic resources and other critical capacities are limited Scarlet et al There is a growing understanding that the problems asso ciated with the sustainability of cities and societies such as urban solid waste management cannot be tackled by a unilateral approach alone Hence opinion has been conveyed that such problems require the successful integration of stake holders efforts towards synergizing resources knowledge ideas and technical expertise Adelle et al This posi tion is in rhythm with the sustainable development concept that strongly emphasizes multiple levels of cooperation and Responsible Editor Ta Yeong Wu Obiora

paradigm shift from the traditional model of public policymaking and service delivery that advocates for the involvement and participation of endusers of services as copartaker in the process This new

it is also recognized that in the low and middleincome countries where resources are usually limited due to incomplete devel opment that coproduction is practically inevitable in publicservice delivery Linders In recent times few research works have been carried out on the adoption and implementation of coproductionas a public policy delivery method at the developing lo cations of the globe Lu and Sidortsov M a n g a ia n d De Vries Mukherjee and Mukherjee Gutberlet But most of these works are largely conducted outside Africa explicating the other global south experience especially in waste management Gutberlet L ua n dS i d o r t s o v The heteroge neous characterizing features of cities and societies alongglobal regional lines in terms of social political econom ic demographic and even cultural peculiarities make it unavoidably necessary to study other regional and countriesexperiences towards contributing to the global dis course of coproduction in waste management Nigeria being the most populous nation and the highest producerof urban solid waste in Africa is more appropriately sit uated to be studied as a case study The current work will therefore provide a departure point for understanding coproduction in solid waste management in Africa s context Moreover the previous works on coproduction in waste management had dwelled more on fewer components of waste management systems For instance waste sorting Lu and Sidortsov D iL i d d oa n d Vinella waste reduction and sorting Mclaren and Agyeman waste collection Landi and Russo and informal recycling Failor G u t b e r l e t The current work discussed more components such as waste conversion waste transportation ewaste management recycling informal recycling and resource recovery The paper is structured as follows the introduction de scribes the background of the research study the next section is a brief literature overview and conceptual frameworkSection Methodology explains the study methodology the results and findings are discussed in the section Research findings and discussion The final section is the conclusionLiteratureconceptual framework Waste management status in Nigeria brief overview With a population currently estimated at million people in Nigeria is struggling with enormous socioeconomicchallenges which have been predicted to persist into the future due to i unmitigated growth in both general and urban pop ulation and ii lack of attendant growth in the country sc r i t ical capacities such as stateoftheart urban infrastructure ad vancement in technology and economic resources Ezeudu E z e u d ue ta l Thus the continuous population growth results in the proliferation of both urban and urbaniz ing areas and the resultant rise in the quantities of solid waste generated by communities Ezeudu et al The quantity of waste generated by million people currently living in Nigeria s cities is about tonnes per day TPD and this value is projected to exceed TPD by Ezeuduet al Unfortunately both in the past and the present Nigeria s waste management procedures policies and insti tutional arrangement has followed a topdown structural approach where qualitative laws are made with little or no con siderations to the input of the nonstate actors in the policymaking and service delivery cycle of commissioning design delivery or assessment Agunwamba E z e u d u et al This has led to undesired waste management outcomes in the form of poor waste collection services inef ficient recycling and resource recovery schemes and abysmal waste disposal methods which have characterized manyNigerian cities Ogwueleka N n a j i The current status of waste management in Nigeria is also characterized by the absence of waste management data absence of wastesorting schemes lack of conceptual planning for waste mini mization inadequate financing mechanism and poor waste management policy regimes Ezeudu et al Detailed discussion on the past and current waste management prac tices in Nigeria can be found in Ezeudu et al Meanwhile today s conceptualization of sustainable waste management operations has gone beyond adequate waste col lection and efficient disposal to include business and econom ic possibilities towards achieving a circular economy Centobelli et al The heightening awareness that the global resources are finite in availability has triggered a grow ing focus by businesses exploring better resources and processefficiency at different stages of production and consumption to promote the principles of circular economy Patwa et al Circular economy principles promote waste reduction waste reuse eliminating waste and pollution optimal use of products and regeneration of natural resources EllenMacArthurFoundation Previous works on the circular economy in solid waste management in Nigeria has identified the key enablers to circular economy adoption as the presence of informal waste recycling activities the existenceEnviron Sci Pollut Resof government agencies that serve as formal regulators prov en marketability of the solid waste streams generated across the country Ezeudu and Ezeudu and collaboration among stakeholders Ezeudu et al In recent times many coproduction efforts have continued to emerge in Nigeria to tackle the country s monumental waste management challenges The aim of this paper is there fore to analyze these coproduction efforts to synthesize their prospective challenges and opportunity and also to recommend scientific solutions and guidance that will reposition them towards effective public service delivery in Nigeria The current work will further discuss the implications of thiscoproduction in waste management for a circular economy The concept of coproduction Before the s the dominant interaction method betweenthe public administration and public service receivers waspassive where governments provide services to the public with the limited active participation of the citizens Sorrentino et al The introduction of coproduction as an alternative method of public service delivery is princi pally hinged on the belief that the production and delivery of services unlike the production of goods is often difficultwithout the active participation of the recipients Ostrom Hence the citizen s contributions have proved neces sary for the production and delivery of hard services such as police military service and waste management and soft ser vices such as education health and disaster management Parks et al The advantage of this change in service production method is that it has turned the receivers of public services into consumers that can exercise choices while at the same time reframes the coproduction as something that canbe added to the repertoires of services delivery arrangements to improve efficiency Alford The concept of coproduction as a public policy mecha nism has evolved from traditional methods that constitute mainly of organization and competition in public service de livery to nontraditional methods characterized by differentcollaborative arrangements and multiple actors involvements Sorrentino et al The taxonomy of coproduction in public service has also been highlighted in the extant body ofliterature Bovaird et al Mukherjee and Mukherjee The commonly agreed facts among scholars are that the actors in coproduction can be broadly categorized into two which include i the state actors or agents acting on behalf of the government either through direct or indirect contracts and ii nonstate actors that interact with the state actors in public service delivery Another classification in co production also exists along with the roles and objectives ofthe actors which include individual coproduction andcollec tive coproduction Individual coproduction is defined as a production arrangement where a client or a customerindividually or in a group participates in the production or partproduction of the services they use while receiving ben efits that are largely personal Brudney and England In the collective variant coproduction includes efforts from cit izens volunteers and other non governmental partners intending to provide benefit to the entire communityNabatchi et al classified coproduction according to four service cycles in which it can occur The first is co commission which entails working together of state actors and nonstate actors in strategizing prioritizing and identify ing the needed public services outcomes and users Co design involves undertaking public service delivery planning decisions together state and nonstate actors Codelivery means joint actions undertaken by the two parties at the point of delivering the services while the last stage which is co assessment means post evaluation and monitoring of public services by the two actors Recent scholarships have also pos ited that i the extension of the coproduction process to accommodate behavioral changes among the citizens in the de sign and implementation of public service delivery is equally essential in assessing the outcome of the service productionMukherjee and Mukherjee ii positive attitude on the part of public officers could improve the coproduction out comes Landi and Russo One of the key enablers to co production in public service delivery in modern times is ad vances in information and communication technology ICT Sorrentino et al Through the creation of an interactive platform ICT builds a platform for extensive input from users knowledge integration and user participation which are essential elements required for effective coproduction in public service delivery Frissen et al Although the impacts of digital technologies on different elements of coproductioncould be evaluated through an analytical framework Lember et al Table summarizes the conceptual framework Methodology This study is conducted adopting a qualitative method for the following reasons i surveybased methodologies and quan titative measurements are either lesspreferred or inappropri ate for examining organizational processes such as coproduction arrangement Strauss and Corbin Y i n ii when the specific objective of the research is to gain an understanding of richness and complexity of the phe nomenon quantitative methods such as surveybased and quantitative approach are less capable of providing detailand capturing insights making the qualitative method more appropriate Lincoln and Guba iii qualitative research methods provides a unique avenue for understanding complex nuanced situations where interpersonal ambiguity and multiple interpretations exist Austin and Sutton We therefore use an exploratory case study Yin t oa s s e s sEnviron Sci Pollut Resthe problems and challenges of coproduction arrangements in waste management in Nigeria Four cases were selected forthe exploration through purposeful sampling methodology which is a criterionbased selection method that allows sam pling only by predefined profile and informationrich cases Patton This is to ensure that a great deal about matters of importance can be synthesized for indepth study Patton The criteria for the selection of the first three cases is that the case will be substantially involved in the components of a waste management system which include waste minimi zation waste sorting waste transportation waste recyclingresource recovery waste collection andor waste disposal The initial data collection and analysis show that these first three cases had similar motivations for involving in coproduction The fourth case was added to explicate the roles of ICT in coproduction as mentioned earlier in the conceptual framework to enrich the study The research data was collected through public available archival sources such as company websites news documentaries project documents of interna tional aid agencies archived YouTube interviewsdocumentaries magazines and newspapers The data obtained from different sources were triangulated and it shows a high degree of consistency Denzin and Lincoln Miles and Huberman The data was analyzed using the iterative process of case comparison The cases are described in section Case description In addition to this we conducted a focus group discussion FGD to complement the case data Multiple data collection in qualitative research aids in obtaining maximum insight intospecialized topics Hammarberg et al FGD as a re search method is unique as it employs an interactional but guided discussion as a means of generating the rich details of complex experience and the reasoning behind actions per ceptions beliefs and attitude Carey Also FGD is appropriate where the existing knowledge of a study is limitedand elaboration of pertinent issues is necessary Powell and Single Adopting the purposive sampling method as recommended by Patton ten professionals were select ed from the waste management industry Purposive selection adds potency to the focus group discussion since the bestdesired data can be generated through rich information cases Patton Participants were recruited and selected specif ically because they can illuminate the topic being studied Hammarberg et al The ten selected participants in clude four active researchers in the area of waste managementtwo waste management professionals from the private sector two waste managers working with the government and the remaining two participants serve as observers The two observers will observe to ensure impartiality in the process Powell and Single McLafferty A letter of invi tation and information leaflets were sent to the participantahead of the discussion The FGD lasted for sixty minutes and was videoaudio recorded transcribed and analyzed The themes of the focus group discussion were developed to complement the case research data The following themes were highlighted during the discussion iThe prospects and opportunities of the emerging co production models in waste management in Nigeria ii The challenges and limitations of the emerging models of coproduction in waste management in Nigeria iii The future directions of the emerging models of co production in waste management in Nigeria iv The implications for the Circular economy Case description Case Wecyclers a waste recycling initiative Lagos is the African most populated city and therefore the largest city producing urban solid waste in the continent The population of Lagos was estimated at million people in concentrated in a localized land area of km which makes the city among the most densely populated in Africa The public institutions responsible for the waste man agement in the city cannot properly manage its waste due tofactors such as poor street network traffic congestion inade quate staff poor technology and limited economic resources This has resulted in tremendous waste managementTable The summarized conceptual framework for coproduction

environment and public health Heaps of waste dumped beneath the bridges water channels and railway tracks are acommon sight in the city The collection services are limited to the visibility areas while lowincome areas such as slums and ghettos are left out Ezeudu et al The only known existing private participation in waste management in Lagos is through the traditional publicprivate partnerships where some private entities join in the service delivery through contractterms Aliu et al Going by the full and rounded mean ing of coproduction this practice meets the criteria as co production in the traditional sense but has limitations in todays narrowed conception of coproduction that distinctively separate state actors or contract agents of government from nonstate actors Motivated by the problem caused by thecitys poorly handled waste MIT graduate Bilkiss Adebiyi cofounded Wecylers a waste recycling outfit in Wecyclers first started as a local innovation that collects solidwaste from Lagos s poor urban households The initial aim was to bring waste management services to the underserved population and households in the municipal city Due to poorstreet networks the state waste management authorities are not able to access these areas with standard waste collection trucks and other vehicular equipment Wecyclers designed a tricycle for easy navigation of the streets where the waste will be collected Fig They will take the waste to the designated center for sorting and informs the households through mobile phone messages on how many points they have earned for trading theirdiscarded items The points are converted and rewarded to the households in the form of food items cleaning products and cell phone call units At present the Wecyclers wastemanagement initiative is operating a model that integrates lowcost recyclables waste management facilities which uses technology to raise awareness on the importance of recyclingAs of January Wecyclers has collected over tonsof waste serviced over households and employed over people Guardian Wecyclerscom Further partnerships have been created with small andmediumscale industries and multinational companies that place a demand for recyclables Recognizing the impact of this service on the city dweller the Lagos State WasteManagement Authorities has also formed a partnership with the company in the policy framework that will ensure the sustainability of the operation At the onset of the initiativesthe company visits households to register them as customers partners but over time more and more people are visiting the company to register on their own as they want to be part of thereward system Guardian Another incentive to this is that the waste management regulation of the state requires the households to pay for their waste collection services while theWecyclers offer a reverse model where households get paid for their trash Wecyclers are also issuing franchises for other entrepreneurs at the various Nigerian locations for recreationof the same waste recycling model Case Hinckley Recycling ewaste recycling outfit There is clear evidence that formal recycling of urban solid waste is nonexistent in Nigeria and the previous attempts bythe government to establish recycling schemes on solid waste have not been successful Nzeadibe and Ajaero E z e u d u et al A large volume of ewaste generated in Nigeria annually together with the ones that come from abroad con stitute a serious threat to the public health and environmental sustainability in the country UNEP The informal e waste recycling system in Nigeria which consists of waste pickers scrap dealers and middlemen has been in existence but operates with rudimentary methods This exposes thewaste workers to potential harm and toxic substances Hinckley Group started operations in Nigeria in as a telecommunications consultancy firm servicing the oil and Fig Tricycle designed constructed by Wecyclers for convenient waste collection services from inaccessible areassource authors productionEnviron Sci Pollut Resgas industry When the company began acquiring high vol umes of nonfunctional and endoflife IT equipment they began to explore ewaste management opportunities The aftermath is Hinckley Recycling an ewaste recycling outfit that they established in Because of the heightening aware ness that ewaste embodied some varied amount of hazardoussubstances eg lead mercury and cadmium its handling requires special skill and specialized training to avoid expo sure to harms and health hazards With collaboration with theAssociation of Vendors for Used Electronic and Allied Products the company recruits and trains scavengers on safe methods of ewaste dismantling and handling The Recycler Through their program closing the loop they partner with local entrepreneurs eg students running a small busi ness established companies and waste pickers to collect andstore scrap ewaste material for onward shipment to the devel oped countries following Basel Convention guidelines and the Nigerian local regulations such as Lagos State EnvironmentalProtection Agency LASEPA and National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency NESREA Under the Collect and Recycle Services Hinckley Recycling offers specialized services that target or ganizations that have obsolete or unwanted technology equip ment for recovering redundant electronic items securely de stroy all confidential and protected data and manages the safe recycling of ewaste As of June it is reported that theclosing the loop program has helped over people to earn additional income through safe employment and over million phones have been collected ThisDay Case Pearl Recycling waste recovery and conversion initiative Nigeria s current urban population of million people gen erates about tonnes of waste per day Ezeudu et al The state cannot optimally collect this waste for proper disposal Consequently a large proportion of them ends up in unauthorized places such as drainages roadsides and canals Motivated by the need to fill this public service delivery gapOlamide AyeniBabjide founded Pearl Recycling Pearl Recycling is a social enterprise initiative that collects munic ipal solid waste components eg tyres bottles newspapersmagazines straws CD places plastics for reuse and in re making of innovative products such as furniture and decora tive wares The company employs uneducated artisans as waste collectors or scavengers while the collected waste is treated before being transformed into sustainable furniture anddecorative arts Fig Through the pay for cash initiative Pearl Recycling en courages urban dwellers to bring their discarded products totheir workshop for exchange for cash or swap with finished products at a discounted rate The implication is that the outfit is instigating a mindset change among the urban dwellerswhereby households individually sort their waste before dis posal to remove items that can be traded for a value Pearl Recycling s workshop has turned into a vocational skill transferacquisition center that attracts a large number of un employed youths that come to learn how to convert waste material into an innovative product For instance in partnership with the Ford Foundation through grant funding the company has trained unemployed youths in Lagos on waste conversion techniques thereby increasing the awareness and the population of Nigerians with knowledge of waste conversion Solutionsearch The company has also partnered with artisans like vulcanizers and informal wastepickers to ensure constant and optimal collection of special ized waste such as tyre and discarded CD plates waste By the recycling scheme has trained and empowered over people directly and indirectly and sensitized around million Nigerians on waste recycling through social media channels and have collected and upcycled over tons ofwaste Pearlrecylingcom Another unique thing is that their finished products made from waste are targeted at also providing affordable consumables to the poor and vulnerablewho cannot afford comparable products The inexpensive na ture of the products is probably because the products are made from waste materials Currently Pearl Recycling is creating upcycling hubs across Lagos while making plans for expan sion within and beyond Nigeria Case OkwuEco mobile App for waste collectorsdealers OkwuEco is an IT app created by a Nigerian startup that uses image recognition to educate households about recycling and links them with merchants who can trade their waste material for cash credits or mobile data through the security of anonline platform African Business The app creates a kind of market arena for the interaction of buyers and sellers of waste items Through the OkwuEco app users identify sortbuy and dispose of solid waste from any location in the coun try The transaction could be for cash or product swap The OkwuEco app further creates a platform for automatic schedules for pickups or dropoffs with waste merchants or disposal services OkwuEco was incorporated in November and is currently piloting with users selected among waste mer chants and dealers The app is userfriendly and supports mul tiple languages and payment options and is specifically de signed to capture the needs of even unbanked segments in the Nigerian urban areas It has impact tools that offer action able insights for effective user engagements and decisionmaking Just like what is often common to new IT solutions the mobile app is currently attracting the attention of several stakeholders whose inputs have been useful in finetuning thenew technology and redesigning the business model This is to embrace market dynamics and policy landscapes towards ef ficient quality service delivery OkwuEco generates revenueEnviron Sci Pollut Resby charging a percentage on transactions made through the IT platform while merchants also pay a subscription feeFurthermore the new technology helps the users to mark ille gal dumpsites in their living locations of which they can no tify the state authorities about or organize cleanups and earnpoints In the long term the app will help waste merchants and dealers to lower overhead costs on logistics expand and con nect to new market segments measure the impact of revenueand could track and report data on recyclables in Nigeria Disrupt Africa The summary of the attributes of the cases is presented in Table Research findings and discussion Prospects and opportunities Waste management is a critical and essential public service globally In most places around the world the provision of effective and sustainable waste services is the statutory obligation of governments through policies material deployment financing mechanisms and institutional arrangements Waste management typically involves activities such as waste collection waste transportation waste storage waste recycling resource recovery and waste disposal methods But the poor status of these services at the many Nigerian city locations is evidence to prove the inability of the state actors in delivering and providing these essential services In the four cases described the nonstate actors were motivated by the need to complement the effort of the state which is a critical element of the nontraditional type of coproduction in public servicedelivery This position was succinctly captured by Governance International that regards coproduction as pro fessionals and citizens making better use of each other sassets resources and contributions to achieve better outcomes or improved efficiency Governance International The plurality of actors involved in the four cases that range from entrepreneurs IT engineers artisans to tricycle drivers and bring multidimensional expertise ideas and resourcestowards solving a complex social problem of solid waste man agement Consequently certain elements that were absent in the waste management system in Nigeria such as safe ewasterecycling outfits case conversion of waste to decorative items case and monitoring of waste collection through IT devices case have also been introduced as an innovationtowards improving waste service delivery Currently there is no documented data on waste manage ment in Nigeria for the use of the waste management author ities in the country either at the state local or national levels Scarlet et al E z e u d ue ta l The prospect here is that with the introduction of the ICT in the waste sectors through IT app monitoring evaluation and collation of waste management data could be made possible The FGD unanimously agreed that the coopting of multiple actors with var ied professional skills and backgrounds in public service de livery such as waste management is the right thing to do especially in a multisectional economy like Nigeria Poor awareness and knowledge among the public have often been reported as a major setback to effective waste management in most developing countries Hoornweg and Bhada Tata The four described cases have evidence to show their capabilities in heightening public awareness of wasterecycling from waste products For instance Pearl Recycling through its programs and operations has made the majority of urban dwellers know that most of their household items perceived to have reached the end of their service cycle could be sold or converted to a new product Wecyclers waste manage ment initiatives are increasing awareness among the Fig A decorative household furniture made from the wastetyre at Pearl Recycling source Design Indabacom Environ Sci Pollut Reshouseholds that they can get value for their waste items in the form of food materials cleaning products and mobile phone airtime The use of daily household goods such as milk andshampoo as an incentive to draw citizens into waste manage ment coproduction has also been reported in Shangai China Wu et al Participant during the FGD noted that the emerging coproduction in the country could raise the con sciousness among the urban dwellers that the waste initially meant to be discarded can be traded for value This invariablywould diminish indiscriminate waste disposal habits and in crease waste recycling rates In developing countries municipalities often dedicate about of their annual waste management budget to waste collection at the urban centers Hoornweg and Bhada Tata Scarlet et al Notwithstanding the services a r en o ts t i l le f f i c i e n ta n do f t e nl i m i t e dt oo n l yh i g h a n d middleincome areas while urban lowincome areas such as slums ghettos and shanties are often neglected Iorhemenet al Solomon This is usually because of poor street networks that make it difficult to access by waste col lection trucks Wecycler s case concentrated on these urban poor areas to deliver effective waste management What this means in a broad sense is that additional resources and mate rials have been deployed from nonstate players to supplementthe effort of the state government towards delivering an essen tial public service Also the Wecycler case described has shown the ability to attract fundsgrants from nonstate playersto waste management delivery in Nigeria Wecyclers for ex ample attracted grants from foreign universities while the Pearl Recycling training program for the youths wassponsored by Ford Foundation The FGD participant ex plained that for the emerging coproduction outfits being able to access fundsgrants and supports from donor agenciesshows that they met a certain level of organizational standard and operation protocols such as transparency and integrityThe Focus group unanimously commented on the need for emerging waste management coproduction models to be fur ther strengthened to attracting more resources for waste service delivery Challenges and barriers Despite the progress and prospects brought by the coproduction efforts in waste management in Nigeria asdiscussed in the foregoing section several imminent chal lenges and limitations still abound Firstly the waste manage ment policies and institutional arrangements in Nigeria havefollowed topdown structural settings where the government makes a qualitative law without the input of nonstate actors and the socalled laws are often devoid of scientific economic and business realities on the ground Ezeudu and Ezeudu In the stateoftheart public service delivery it is now increasingly recognized that the complex wicked policy problem such as waste management requires the successful integration of scientific knowledge with local knowledge of particular social environmental and historical circumstancesCoen and Roberts Gollagher and HartzKarp This is called the coproduction of knowledge for policymaking Adelle et al In Nigeria the first and second stages in the service cycle of coproduction as pointed out in the conceptual framework at the foregoing section which are cocommissioning and codesign have been non existent In all the cases except Wecycler that has attracted a partnership with the Lagos state towards a sustainable policythere was no onset arrangement for the coming together of both state and nonstate actors towards identifying prioritiz ing andor planning the waste management service production Because waste management involves a complex chain of activities such as waste minimization collection transpor tation recycling and resource recovery and disposalTable Characteristics of the cases

knowledge at the commissioning and design stages of policy and service delivery is a critical neces sity Waste landfilling for instance is an essential componentof the waste management system since all other methods of waste handling will eventually yield residues that must be disposed of through landfilling Hoornweg and BhadaTata All the four cases described are involved in recycling collection transportation sorting and resource recovery op erations and therefore will still generate a waste stream thatwould be disposed of through landfill Landfilling being the final waste disposal method is still abysmally and solely han dled by the state actorsagents in Nigeria Participants and in the FGD contributed that In essence without a co production in all the components of waste management sys tems the general progress achieved through the emerging coproduction efforts would still be largely undermined Secondly the freeforall proliferation of the waste co production models could lead to abuse and exploitation ofmaterial and resources if not properly harmonized and regu lated Three of the four cases Wecyclers Pearl Recycling and Hinckley Recycling largely involve the engagementand recruitment of informal waste pickers Informal waste pickers consist of the urban poor which are mainly women and children and as such are often prone to exploitation and abuse Made et al At the informal waste recycling system in Nigeria the exploitation of poor waste pickers bythe middlemen has been reported in the past Nzeadibe and Ajaero Middlemen in the waste picking value chain are businessmen that buy the picked recyclables from the wastepickers Ezeudu et al Since they often have the fund to mopup the recyclable in a quantity that the factories can buy they become more influential in the informal waste pickingmarket and most of often than not control the prices and fix transaction conditions that are unfavorable to the poor waste pickers Ezeudu et al Fear of exploitation of informal waste pickers is an imminent challenge in the emerging co productions models For instance it was mentioned in the case of Pearl Recycling that most of the recruited waste pickers areuneducated which has automatically limited their ability to engage in fair bargains and negotiations In the Wecyclers case it was also mentioned that the company rewards households with foodstuff cleaning products and mobile phone airtime which probably could undermine fairness in the re ward system The group interaction indicated an agreementthat though informal waste pickers have become an essential element in the emerging waste management coproduction there is a need for a proper guideline to be laid by the authorities to ensure their healthy and safe inclusion in the co productions efforts Third in all four cases there is nonuniformity in the busi ness model It is not easy to understand the exact business model applied by the emerging coproduction outfits Wecycler Pearl Recyclers and Hinckley Recycling seem topractice a hybrid model that includes both notforprofit and forprofit business models Participants and argued that if these business models are not harmonized through appropriate formal regulations and policies it could likely lead to two outcomes i not being able to attract funding incen tives and grants from appropriate quarters ii fraudulentpractices like an invasion of taxes The standard practice is that if an organization declares for nonprofit it could attract funding from charitable organizations and perhaps a rebatefrom the government to support its public service production Whereas if it declares forprofit it then becomes appropriately positioned to pay taxes and levies while its coproductioneffort in public service delivery could be measured and cate gorized under corporate social responsibility Fourth despite the huge potential in urban solid waste val orization as exemplified in the discussed cases there is still a need for wider consciousness that certain classes of waste such as ewaste Hinckley Recycling and tyre waste PearlRecycling still embodied some hazardous substances there by requires a special guideline for handling Although the case report shows that Hinckley Recycling applies internationalbest practices in its ewaste handling operations and the con version of the tyre to furniture as done by Pearl Recycling was also after proper treatment there is still a need for document ed unified and generalized guideline to be regulated by the state actors through policies and institutions This is crucial forother prospective entrepreneurs that would want to recreate the models in the country Future directions and implications for circular economy Contemporary deliberations on urban solid waste manage ment are largely overlapping with the concept of the circular economy The circular economy involves the application of practices policies and institutions towards ensuring a regenerative and restorative approach to waste and resource man agement It leads to an increase in waste recycling rates job creation business profitability while ensuring the current andfuture sustainability of the environment and safeguards of public health The implications for the circular economy as it concerns the emerging coproduction models in waste management in Nigeria will be discussed in what follows iEcoindustrial park The ecoindustrial park is an essential element of a circular economy system where industries factories and businesses are located in proximity to each other for mutual benefit and for the goal of waste reduction and pollution control andachieving environmental quality promotions at large Sacirovic et al Participant contributed that the emerging models of coproduction in waste management inEnviron Sci Pollut ResNigeria are already creating an avenue for collaboration among businesses and undertakings that share mutual objec tives and goals It therefore has created an avenue for theestablishment of ecoindustrial parks in a mesolevel circular economy system through appropriate policies Although the Henckely Recycling case tends to observe standardizedmethods in its operations there are still no clear indications that the ewaste recycling facilities are located far from house hold settlements Environmental pollution resulting from ewaste recycling activities is tipped as a major contributor to negative health impacts in the communities where this infor mal recycling takes place with women and children being themost vulnerable Perkins et al Singh et al Group discussion submitted that the emerging coproduction efforts have created the opportunity for the onset planning for ecoindustrial parks especially for ewaste recycling outfits that would be sited far from human inhabitants ii Extended producer responsibility Nigeria s waste management policy landscapes and prac tices have not extensively integrated extended producer re sponsibility in the circular economy manner Ezeudu and Ezeudu One key factor that is likely responsible for this could the absence of information and lack of knowledge on how EPR could be implemented However the vast majority of items used in Nigeria can be linked to either a foreign or local producer The Hinckley Recycling case described has shown the practical possibility of shipping ewaste back to thedeveloped countries while Wecyclers entered into partner ships with indigenous multin ationals eg CocaCola GlaxoSmithKline on the return of recyclables Even in absence of a formal proclamation of circular economy in the country the studied coproduction cases have established ef fective collaborations in the form of EPR Participant suggested that these existing EPR could serve as an avenue and key enabler to the implementation of EPR in the country in a circular economy manner iii Informal waste pickersjob creation Informal waste pickers often regarded as the informal econ omy plays a key role in the circular economy by promoting the integrated management of the city s solid waste Siman et al It is an activity that mainly involves the urban poor that use the most rudimentary method to retrieve a value from waste material for onward recycling Safe inclusion of theactivities of informal waste pickers requires taking measures that will ensure that their occupational health and safety are guaranteed The major challenge associated with informalwaste picking is their lack of organization poor economic status illiteracy and vulnerability to harm and illness The coproduction efforts studied have shown that informal wastepickers are crucial to urban waste management delivery in Nigeria Therefore the advent of interactions between waste pickers and formalcorporate businesses is a development thatwill foster circular economy introduction in Nigeria Nevertheless this will require a policy change that will ensure that their interests and health will be protected iv Endoflife waste treatment practices For a complete articulation and implementation of a circu lar economy model in waste management there is a need for effective and environmentally efficient endoflife waste treatment methods Ferronato et al None of the four co production cases described involves endoflife waste treat ment However it is already indicated that the coproductionoutfits will eventually produce waste residues that still require treatment and disposal This is another good opportunity for the integration of modalities for final waste treatment in thecoproduction models For instance the majority of the resi due that will be generated by Hinckley Recycling ewaste would best be handled by incineration Although the highcost of incinerators has been hinted at as the major impedi ment to its massive deployment in subSahara Africa Scarlet et al But through appropriate policy incentives the waste management recycling outfits could be supported by the governmentNGOs through grants to acquire incineratorfacilities for appropriate waste treatment Another way to look at it is that the large quantity of residue from coproduction outfits eg Pearl Recycling and Wecyclers are usually nonrecoverable resources lefto ver after resource recovery recycling and therefore only suitable for final disposal in the landfill Depositing only sorted waste items in the landfillprolongs its lifespan minimizes the cost of maintenance pro tects the underground water sources and reduces environmen tal air pollutions All these attributes are essential in effectivecircular economy implementation in solid waste management Further policy implications Successful implementation of circular economy requires thedesign and implementation of appropriate policies and enforcement of regulations Morseletto The existing waste management practices in Nigeria are typically such that state actors collect waste from designated locations and dis pose of them at the dumpsites and landfills Nnaji Asides from the payment of waste management levies theexisting policies never specify the roles and contributions of the citizenry in urban solid waste management Consequently the vast majority of Nigerians only participate in waste management by only selfdelivering their wastes to community bins with little or no effort at sorting or separating from the source This has indirectly affected the country sw a s t eEnviron Sci Pollut Resrecycling rates and also negatively reflects on the overall waste management status Restructuring of policies is there fore a way forward The Wecyclers and Pearl Recycling experience have shown that with incentives the urban house holds can be coopted into waste sorting and recycling It has therefore given a clue on how incentivize policies canaffect the attitude and interest of the masses on waste manage ment We believe that the current waste management policy framework can be finetuned as it was done in Shanghai Chinawhere the local government in collaboration with the Bank of China introduced a household Green account Wu et al Through the initiative household waste sorting results in points in the account which can be redeemed for items such as milk and shampoo andor deductions in utility bills Lu and Sidortsov Meanwhile there is an urgent need for regulation of the existing and emerging coproduction efforts through policy and institutional frameworks The targeted areas of this regulation should be on ensuring optimal occupational health and safety conditions of the participating informal waste pickers harmonization of the business models and involving thewaste management coproducers in the design and commis sioning stages of service production It is our opinion that the existing waste management authorities in the various states of the federation should be restructured to undertake these func tions and empowered by law to enforce them Conclusions Waste management is a complex and hard public service A large body of evidence has also shown that due to multiple socioeconomic challenges such as poor economic resourcesand inefficient urban infrastructure cities in low and middle income countries cannot adequately tackle their waste man agement problems relying solely on the resources and effortsof the state actors Participation and contribution are required from the citizenry Based on this understanding the current work examined the different models of coproduction in wastemanagement in Nigeria to synthesize and analyze their pros pects challenges opportunities and future direction towards possible circular economy adoption The result of the studyrightly shows that several actors with varied skills and profes sional backgrounds are already partaking in waste manage ment delivery in the country These actors have introduced increased awareness on waste recycling extra resources through grants and innovations through ICT and waste conversion thereby complementing the efforts of the government However lack of onset arrangement on cocommissioning and codesigning of waste management service productionnonuniformity in the business operating models and absence of generalized guideline for regulation are challenges to the effective waste management coproduction in the countryAlso the studied coproduction cases have huge potential in fostering the adoption of circular economy in the country es pecially in promoting the establishment of ecoindustrialparks extended producer responsibility and safe integration of informal waste recycling Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge the support received from
