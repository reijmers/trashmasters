resource and waste challenges that are inadequately managed in the current linear product system circular economy ce strategies o er potential to close the loop on electronic products and materials but often lack the futureoriented perspective needed to keep pace with this dynamic sector the present study addresses this challenge by developing a logistic forecastingmaterial ow model that can predict future resource and waste ows for products with abundant historic sales data mature products as well as for products that have just entered the market emerging products one of thekey trends observed across current and legacy electronics is the steadily shrinking innovation cycle where thetime between a product s market entry and peak sales is decreasing over time this trend coupled with extensive historic and modern product sales data was used to create adoption scenario forecasts for emerging productsliketness trackers smart thermostats and drones findings show that these devices are likely to have rapid uptake in the market but may be quickly replaced by subsequent product innovations in contrast waste ow forecasts for mature products like crts desktops monitors and at panel tvs showed their declining con tribution to the us ewaste stream this study contributes a modeling framework that can be used to inform cestrategies in electronics by identifying near term opportunities and risks in endoflife management of productsto extend product life and close the loop on key materials introduction consumer electronics make up one of the fastest growing market segments in the united states with annual shipments worth over billion in revenue consumer technology association un precedented innovation and increased consumer demand for fastersleeker and smaller devices have drastically changed the electronics landscape in the last decade large single function products have been replaced with multifunctional portable products ryen et al and electronic components are increasingly integrated into accessoriesclothing appliances and tness products perera et al industry groups predict that consumers will increasingly adopt smart hometechnology products including thermostats and security systems while at the same time maintaining high ownership levels of traditional products like smart phones and televisions consumer technology association while the evolution and expansion of consumer electronics has enabled social education and communication advances it has alsocreated new sustainability challenges balde et al electronic products are characterized by environmental impacts across all lifecycle stages from raw material extraction to endoflife productmanagement kohler and erdmann the functionality of modern electronics is realized through a mix of complex components composed of precious scarce and base metals cucchiella et al tansel which are extracted through energy intense processes leading to signicant upstream emissions dutta et al many of the critical materials found in electronics such as cobalt lithium and rare earth elements are also widely used in electric vehicles and clean energy technologies leading to concerns about their longterm supply security gaustad et al in addition legacy electronic components may contain hazardous materials like mercury lead and cadmium whichmay cause harmful health and environmental impacts if not managed properly at endoflife chen et al kiddee et al given rapid innovation cycles increasing consumer adoption and decliningproduct lifespans in the electronics sector bakker et al material consumption and waste generation are bound to increase in the futuretherefore consumer electronics are ripe for a transformation via the circular economy to minimize resource

materials are recovered recycling economics often hinge on a few lowvolumehighvalue materials such as gold which are increasingly diluted in the ewaste stream due to product lightweighting trends kasulaitis et al the presence of hazardous materials like lead and mercury in complex components like older printed circuit boards and display units also can limit recovery e orts chen et al kiddee et al in addition shrinking product lifespans babbitt et al are e ec tively narrowing the window in which circular innovation can be de ployed leaving our ewaste management system to be backwards looking focusing on legacy devices that have been in the market for a long time even while new products are emerging in the waste stream babbitt et al these factors underscore the importance of creating circular economy ce strategies that are agile and responsive to the evolving demand for and waste from consumer electronics consumption ce in terventions in electronics should respond to key leverage points that maximize resource e ciency and minimize environmental burden through green product design creation of reuse markets developmentof material recovery technologies to improve use of recycled materials in products and policies to e ectively engage multiple stakeholders in resource conservation and recovery activities bocken et al gaustad et al oconnor et al green product design strategies include design for longevity bakker et al ease of disassembly vanegas et al and reduced use of critical and environmentally intense materials boks and stevels however for most of these ce interventions to create proactive rather thanreactive solutions they must be attuned to future resource demand and waste generation take for example the case of current us ewaste policy im plementation the product categories that are most commonly covered under each state s policy mostly re ect mature product categories that have already saturated the market omitting emerging products whosematerial opportunities and risks are unknown electronics takeback coalition near term forecasts of consumer discards can inform ewaste policies especially in setting the scope of products to be cov ered under the policies and establishing realistic annual ewaste col lection targets similarly new product design would bene t from better predictive capacity about which materials may be available from sec ondary sources eg used electronics in a closedloop scenario and which materials may be scarce due to consumption in other competing industries in any of these cases proactive insight is necessary but fundamentally limited by a lack of the predictive tools and data needed to forecast physical ows in the evolving electronics sector which is key in circular economy implementation kalmykova et al therefore this paper addresses the question how do we proactively plan and deploy ce strategies for the rapidly evolving electronic product sector this challenge is addressed by creating and validating models to forecast product sales and ewaste generation and then using these models to identify issues and opportunities for circular economy in the electronics sector to this end historic product adoption data are studied to generalize the factors that govern product adoption trajec tories and then applied to the model based on established ewaste es timation methods from literature to generate near term forecasts for both mature and emerging products the paper is organized as follows section reviews forecasting literature that guided the development of the model section describes the methodology including model de velopment validation and application to inform ce planning sub sequent sections discuss results and broader implications literature review ewaste estimation methods in the literature include inputoutput models factor models time series econometric analysis and directwaste analysis li et al wang et al among these ma terial ow analysis mfa which is an extension of inputoutput modeling is widely used and an appropriate choice for ce planning as it enables estimation of the product and material demand and man agement of secondary resources kalmykova et al mfa esti mates the stocks and ows of materials within a de ned temporal and spatial system commonly using data on commodity ows into the system and their discard rates brunner and rechberger in most ewaste literature mfa applications are typically static or retrospective kasulaitis et al li et al miller et al wang et al due to the nature of available data however ce planning re quires a more proactive approach thus requiring forecasts of product adoption and obsolescence such information is not commonly avail able but potentially can be approximated according to models of pro duct adoption cycles forecasting product adoption is commonly achieved using the s shaped logistic curve or sigmoid curve to describe a product market adoption cycle fisher and pry kucharavy and de guio marchetti and nakicenovic meyer et al yang and williams the three parameter logistic curve commonly used insociotechnical systems kucharavy and de guio has its roots in ecology where it was originally used to model population growth ofbiological species lefkovitch while the logistic curve describes a product s growth until it reaches market saturation it does not cap ture the entire market life cycle which includes an inevitable decline due to substitution by competing technologies the nortonbass model which includes logistic distribution as a special case captures both adoption and substitution leading to a product s decline norton and bass this approach has been applied to forecasting consumer electronics including lcd tvs tsai mobile phones computers islam and meade and desktop displays lu et al however as pointed out by tseng et al the nortonbass model is mostly suited for modeling direct substitutions by successive gen erations of technology which is not always observed in consumer electronics particularly in the case of disruptive innovation the fisher pry model has also been applied in electronics forecasting an approach that uses a twoparameter logistic model to describe tech nology substitution cho and daim the logistic fisherpry model was extended by marchetti and nakicenovic to include mutliple generations of energy technologies based on the assumption that technologies grow and decline at logistic rates this model has been used to study adoption of music media meyer et al and oled tvs tseng et al while these studies show that logistic growthdecline is an apt approximation to describe product adoption cycles these models are again reliant on knowledge of subsequent generational replacements in reality replacement cycles and product innovation in consumer electronics are challenging to predict as decline of one technology generation is not always predicated solely on substitution by the next generation in many cases functional convergence leads to decline of many single function devices due to simultaneous substitution by one new multifunctional product for example the decline of digital cam eras camcorders and mp players was driven by the advent of smartphones which would not be otherwise predicted as a successive generation of those products similarly in the case of av audiovisual media the decline of bluray and dvd players was triggered by the advent of new streaming media services rather than a new product generation fig s in the supplemental information illustrates the technological shifts and substitution in av products therefore to in tegrate product adoption cycles in electronics forecasting it is useful to develop modeling capability that can capture adoption trends on a productbyproduct basis even in the absence of information abouts althaf et al resources conservation recycling subsequent generations of technology the methods applied in this paper build on the foundation of models described above through use of the logistic growth and decay curves that have been applied to technology adoption broadly and ewaste forecasts speci cally one new contribution is the construction of these curves independently without the speci cation of an unknown suc cessive replacement technology required to trigger product decline another contribution is the focus on emerging electronic technologies that are not yet widely adopted literature examples have provided several demonstrations of forecasting waste ow from speci c product categories that already comprise a major part of the ewaste streamsuch as computers kahhat and williams petridis et al rahmani et al yang and williams yu et al or on products with known hazards such as cathode ray tube crt tvs gusukuma and kahhat however for ce planning it is equally important to forecast adoption for newer technologies requiringmodeling advances in datascarce cases methodology this paper s objective is to present an mfa model developed to proactively inform key leverage points that can enable ce solutions for electronics for example for mature products that are declining or no longer sold in the market a critical ce challenge is how to recover and manage these products over the remainder of their life cycle particu larly if no demand exists for their reuse or for their component mate rials another challenge is to understand how ewaste policy im plementation might be a ected by the decline of these products in the waste stream for emerging products which may have unforeseensustainability risks but that are not typically covered by ewaste po licies projections are essential to model timing and magnitude of po tential resource demand or the extent to which circular material sys tems can provide these resources with secondary or closedloop supply thus the predictive mfa model was developed with the aforemen tioned ce challenges in mind the overarching approach was to use historical sales data to construct logistic curves of product adoption anddecline and then apply these curves to project future product con sumption and waste ows fig as explained in more detail in the following subsections mfa model framework the mfa model eq estimates annual waste ows using pro duct sales and lifespan probability distributions wls pt in pi pt where wp tis the waste ow of product p in year t l is the probability that product p will reach its endoflife with a lifespan of i years s is the annual product sales into us households for each year and n is the maximum lifespan product sales based on ndings from the literature review described above pro duct sales s pt were approximated by a threeparameter logistic curve eq which includes phases of product growth saturation and then decline in the market similar to the approach of marchetti and nakicenovic andmeyer et al stt ttpt a ea e peak peak btcbtc here a product s sales over its entire market cycle can be described by the time it takes to reach peak adoption t peak the maximum adoption level or peak sales units a growth and decay rates b and b and growth and decay midpoints which are the times at which the curve reaches the in ection point of a c and c for simplicity the parameter b is replaced by the equation ln t wheretis the time required for the logistic curve to grow from to of the carrying capacity for b or decay from to for b a simpli cation demonstrated by meyer et al additional information on the estimation of parameters a t and c is provided in section the choice of logistic curve was veri ed by testing eq against real product sales data ten products were selected that had high quality sales data spanning the entire period between the product s entry into the market to present or to the point at which the productwas no longer sold these data were provided by the consumer technology association as reported in babbitt et al the growth and decline curve for each product was tested against candidate distributions using a least squares estimation approach as implemented in matlab goodness of t parameters including rsquared sse sum of squared errors and bic bayesian information criterion were used toconrm that logistic curves were the best distribution to represent adoption cycle of electronics the matlab code for the mfa model andall related data sheets are provided at althaf product lifespan the other key input to the forecasting mfa model according to eq is the lifespan probability distribution for each product a weibull distribution is applied here as it is the most commonly used distribu tion to model lifespan of electronics in literature bakker et al gu et al nakatani and moriguchi oguchi and kameya the weibull pdf probability density function is given below ft t e t fig

electronics industry sources all other boxes and arrows represent model calculations and outputss althaf et al resources conservation recycling where is the shape parameter is the scale parameter and t is the time the shape and scale parameters describing the distribution are computed from mean and maximum product lifespan estimates from literature see the supplementary information si le table s in this study lifespan is de ned as the total time that a product resides within a household during its rst life after which it becomes available for endoflife management which may include reuse recycling formaterial recovery or discarding mfa model parameters for mature products parameterizing the model described in eqs andis relatively straightforward for mature products because past sales data are readily available the products considered in the mature product category are crt cathode ray tube monitors crt tvs desktop computers printers laptop computers lcd liquid crystal display monitors lcd tvs plasma tvs led light emitting diode monitors led tvs and tablets for these products parameter estimation was carried out by tting the threeparameter logistic curve to each product s unit sales over time depending on the product di erent degrees of the market life cycle are covered by the available sales data ranging from only a few years for led displays to a full life cycle for crt tvs in all cases parameters were extracted from the productspeci c logistic curve based on least squares estimation see si table s for logisticparameters extracted for each product in the mature category the application of the mfa model to mature products is particularly important from the standpoint of assessing ewaste policy in relation to ce planning the mature products analyzed here are those that are most commonly covered by ewaste legislation in us states the mfa results describe waste ows in units of products which were then translated to overall waste stream magnitude based on each product s average mass mass results help relate the waste projections to massbased collectionor recycling targets used by most states in the us product mass esti mations were determined using literature and disassembly as described inbabbitt et al andkasulaitis et al as summarized in si table s mfa model parameters for emerging products in the case of emerging products for which historic adoption data are scarce the guiding approach in estimating parameters for logistic forecasting was to analyze how past products behaved in the market identify trends in the underlying logistic curve size and shape and then extend these trends to products recently introduced the historic sales data of over products table that entered the market between and were compiled and the key parameters that describetheir logistic market trajectory time to peak sigmoid midpoint and t were extracted one of the clear relationships revealed was that theseparameters were inversely related to year of market entry in other words innovation cycles or the time between a product entering the market and reaching saturation at peak sales are shrinking in a steady and predictable way curve tting to this temporal trend was tested to determine if year of market entry could e ectively predict time to peak and growth rate resulting in an exponential curve r as shown in fig where t peakis the time until a product reaches its peak sales and y mis the year the product enters the market to validate this trend the predicted exponential curve was compared against a di erent set of products also shown in table that were not part of the original curve formulation this strong agreement was consistent forexponential curves relating year of market entry to other necessarylogistic parameters including growth rate and sigmoid midpoint see si table s and fig s and s thus most of the parameters required to construct the logistic sales curve eq for emerging products can be predicted by specifying only the year in which that product is rst sold in the market the other parameter required to apply the logistic model eq i sa the carrying capacity or in terms of electronic products the max imum level of product sales for emerging technologies this parameter is dicult to anticipate given the unpredictable nature of technological progress and the rate at which consumer attention ickers from one gadget to the next however past product behavior can again inform projections of future product trends in this case the type of product and the functions it provides was observed in historical sales data to be strongly related to the maximum peak sales some products like phones are owned by individuals rather than households and are seen to be commonplace in modern work and life which is supported by high sales rates over smartphones were purchased per average us household in on the other hand stationary homebased av equipment is shared among members of a household and the saturation point will be lower about vcr or dvd players were purchased per household in the year that each of these products sales peaked the historical peak sales per household were tabulated for all pro ducts listed in table and grouped under categories that describe a product s form or function computing including computers monitorstable products used to identify temporal trends in parameters describing logistic product adoption curves products shaded in gray were used to construct predictive trends while remaining products were used to validate the resulting curves fig the time between a product entering the market and reaching its peak sales volume is shown here to steadily decrease over time a predictive re lationship is built using products represented by lled circles and then validated by comparison against additional products open circless althaf et al resources conservation recycling and printers tvs including multiple technologies of crt lcd led and plasma home media vcr gaming consoles etc small mobile devices mp players digital cameras portable navigation systems etc and phones including basic and smartphones and tablets a full list of products assigned to each category and their peak sales is pro vided in the si table s these data are summarized in fig which visually illustrates the ranges in peak sales observed most productcategories demonstrated consistent ranges of adoption peaks one ex ception was for those products that were ultimately only adopted to a limited degree maximum sales of only about products per household even in the highest sales year these products which represent a scenario of limited adoption included devices like plasma tvs and ereaders both of which were quickly outcompeted by products seeing mainstream adoption such as lcd tvs and tablets re spectively the limited and main stream adoption ranges assigned toeach product category is presented in si table s using the approximations described above the logistic parameters for an emerging product could be generated using only two pieces of information the year of market entry which was used to extrapolate the curve shown in fig to determine time to peak and the type of product it was as best represented by product categories listed above which would establish ranges of the curve s maximum sales in either a trajectory of mainstream or limited adoption to demonstrate the mfa model s applicability in forecasting re source demand from emerging products it was applied to four casestudy products that represent a spectrum of new electronic technolo gies tness trackers smart thermostats drones and oled organic light emitting diode tvs fitness trackers were modeled assmall mobile devices smart thermostats and drones as home media products and oled tvs within the tv category while tness trackers and drones are fundamentally new products smart thermostatsrepresent a case such that a nonsmart alternative already exists and adoption would be related to replacement of legacy systems based onthese observations emerging products were modeled under both po tential trajectories limited adoption which constrained a or peak sales to between products sold per household and mainstream adoption which set peak sales to be equivalent to the mean value observed for the product category to which each of these devices is categorized including an uncertainty range of mfa model application to study interactions of mature and emerging technologies finally the potential usefulness of the predictive model to study interactions of mature and emerging technologies for ce planning whentechnology substitutions occur was demonstrated using the case of tv technologies tvs are the most commonly covered device across all us state ewaste policies and have historically been a primary focus of hazardbased ewaste management due to lead contained in crt glass and the mercury contained in uorescentlit lcd displays oled tvs represent a natural innovation in display technology that has beenprogressing over multiple generations and therefore the forecasts of oled tv adoption were coupled with logistic models of past tv tech nology and the potential evolution of ewaste in the tv category was projected for the next years a time period selected to re ect the long lifespans of these products within the household perfect substitution ofoled for led technology was assumed based on similar observation of each past tv technology generation results the key outcome of this study is the development of an mfa model based on logistic forecasting that can be used to predict ows of pro ducts with abundant historic data and for those with scarce adoption data to inform proactive ce strategies the following sections detail the results for model validation and then demonstrate the model s applic ability in addressing key data challenges in circular economy planningfor electronics model validation the use of a threeparameter logistic curve in modeling adoption cycles growth and decline of products was tested against real sales curves of existing electronics products logistic was the best distribu tion of those compared based on goodness of t parameters such as sse r square and bic the full list of curve tting statistics is reported in si table s the forecasting capability of the mfa model is validated by comparing model generated ewaste ows of crt monitors desktops printers led monitors lcd tvs and laptops with wasteows estimated using actual annual sales data from to fig ranges of peak sales in units sold per us household for products according to functional categories median values are shown as a line across each box fig comparison of ewaste ows estimated using the threeparameter model of logistic sales to ewaste ows calculated directly from real sales data of the products ewaste ows reect annual out ows from us households in thousands of units line plots indicate forecasting model results while scatter plots indicate waste ows estimated from real sales datas althaf et al resources conservation recycling results fig show that forecast results are in strong agreement with those generated from real data with less than error in cumulative ows across products waste ows forecasted ve years forward show how the model captures the e ect of product market decline on ewaste estimations waste ow forecasts in fig predict that crt monitor units in the residential ewaste stream will soon be insigni cant which should help alleviate concerns about lead exposure during their downstream management however in the short term few opportunities exist for closing the loop on these materials as no demand exists for product reuse or crt glass recovery waste ow forecasts for computing and display technologies like laptops and lcd tvs and monitors show that theseproducts have likely reached their peak and will start slowly declining in the waste stream in ve years laptops and printers are forecasted to decrease from their current waste ow while waste lcd tvs are predicted to decline more than from present desktop computers are expected to sharply decline in the waste stream in the next ve years which is expected to have interactive e ects on monitors which are typically purchased to use with desktop computing a comparison with waste ow forecasts by past studies mars et al show that while our model results deviate for some products such aslaptops and printers mfa results are results are close to past estimations for desktops at panel monitors and tvs while desktop waste ows estimated by the mfa model for year di ered by less than from low adoption scenario from those reported by miller et al monitor waste ows de viated by more than from the study which applied the same sales lifespan mfa method here the di erence is likely due to our under lying assumption that monitor adoption follows a ratio with desktopsales based on input from consumer technology industry experts babbitt et al rather than using real monitor sales data which is available to a limited degree but does not account for monitors soldwith desktops as a package other di erences from past studies could be attributed to un certainties in lifespan assumptions as de nition of product lifespans vary widely babbitt et al while model forecasts are impacted by lifespan uncertainties the trends shown in this and other studies areconsistent and the projected decrease in forecast ewaste ows is un likely to change as it is primarily driven by in ows to households in the way of new sales which have begun to decline for all mature products studied these results have signi cant implications to ewaste policy planning as the products analyzed here are the commonly covereddevices in us state ewaste policies forecasting implications to us ewaste policy under extended producer responsibility epr policies adopted for endoflife management of electronics in many us states collection targets are set based on manufacturers shares of covered products in the waste stream as determined by salesadjusted mass estimateselectronics takeback coalition the process of setting collec tion targets often relies on observed trends in past years product col lection rates as the main factor in determining the next year s recovery goals oregon ecycles program neither states nor manu facturers typically have the modeling capability to predict future waste ows limiting their ability to set appropriate targets or plan for endof life management therefore the predictive mfa model o ers sig nicant utility for these stakeholders in its ability to project ewaste ows over a nearterm time horizon to assess how this model might be used by policy stakeholders it is applied to commonly covered devicesin us state policies which include mature products such as tvs monitors computers and printers to estimate their cumulative waste ows in the us fig these estimates were generated using the logistic forecasting model for a year period which includes recentpast and six years beyond the present note that the model predicts the total mass of products coming out of households which may then gointo reuse recycling or discard pathways ewaste ow forecasts in fig suggest that the mature products that are currently the focus of state ewaste policies are beginning todecline in the waste stream a trend expected to continue in the next several years this trend is largely attributable to the changing mix of display technologies where heavy crt tvs and monitors are no longer sold and slowly empty from consumers households while being re placed with lighter products such as at panel displays and tablets these results point to potential sustainability bene ts of reducing the overall amount of ewaste requiring management particularly deviceswhich contain hazardous materials such as crt lead and lcd displays mercury on the other hand the shift introduces new uncertainties for the recycling industry which has long been established around pro cessing large products with high potential for disassembly and com ponent and material recovery further the decline of mature products will be o set to a degree by other products that are now emerging or growing but that are not covered under such policies for examplesmartphones which are a small contribution to ewaste by mass con tain a high concentration of valuable materials including gold cobalt and lithium cucchiella et al in addition tvs which show signicant dynamism within this policy case contain indium a scarce material for which very limited recycling is currently possible buchert et al as policy is a key enabler of the circular economy ewaste regula tions are expected to increase the ability to repair and reuse products orrecover materials that can be returned to functional use in new devices however the forecasted decreasing trends in cumulative waste ow suggest that states will need to fundamentally shift from product collection and recovery targets based on mass alone already states have informally reported declining collection rates and at least one state illinois is moving away from mass targets to conveniencebased sys tems which emphasize consumer access to ewaste collection points it is challenging to benchmark these forecasts to other studies as mostliterature applies a retrospective rather than prospective approach comparison of ewaste ow estimates with past studies powell and chertow u s environmental protection agency b show comparable trends in the leadup to peak waste ows estimated in fig to be however it should be noted that results presented here are for the us residentialconsumer sector only and so the magnitude of ows will naturally be smaller than the abovemen tioned studies which include residential and commercial sectors together a direct comparison of results to a us environmental protection agency study which applied the same saleslifespan method for ewaste estimations from to is provided in si fig s con rming consistency in trends for the overlapping period forecasting implications of emerging technologies the predictive mfa model was applied to four case study products that represent a wide array of emerging technologies for which data arescarce and nearterm forecasting is necessary to identify potential op portunities and risks for ce planning for each of the emerging tech nologies tness trackers smart thermostats drones and oled tvs both mainstream and limited adoption trajectories were projectedbased on the peak sales ranges for the product categories to which these technologies most closely align the forecasts shown in fig were generated using only the year of market entry as predictor of logisticparameters associated with growth rate and time to peak sales and the product category as predictor of the maximum sales forecast results compared against the limited real sales data that are available see si table s show that among the products studieddrones and tness trackers have reached or may soon approach their peak as per the adoption forecasts tness trackers have entered mainstream adoption in a manner consistent with other small mobile products and have reached the maximum carrying capacity or peak sales to households on the other hand drones appear to be unlikely tos althaf et al resources conservation recycling enter mainstream adoption as a household product annual sales of tness trackers which are currently around million units are un likely to go above million units while maximum annual sales ofdrones are unlikely to go above million units if these products follow the trends of past products in their respective categories the smart thermostat results suggest that they are still in the growth phase but as a home product the annual sales will likely peak at less than million units even if they enter mainstream adoption even though it is too early to con rm which adoption scenario oled tvs will follow the mainstream ranges are more likely given past tv turnover and a recentpeak of led tv sales which is usually a harbinger that a substitute product is beginning to invade the market niche these case study ndings which can easily be extended to any electronic product with only a limited amount of data have signi cant implications for circular resource management many of these productscontain complex components like lithiumion batteries which contain critical materials that are in high demand in other sectors includingelectric vehicle manufacturing in the case of emerging display tech nology oleds which contains display units that employ thin organic carbonbased lms for lighting bagher the implications on resource consumption and endoflife management are unknown thisuncertainty underscores the need for forecasts that predict likely ma terial implications as discussed before whether a technology will achieve mainstream adoption depends on similar competing technolo gies in the market in the case of tvs another emerging technology is also beginning to grow qleds quantum dot leds are a variation of display technology recently introduced that may ultimately compete for market share with oleds qled displays are typically constructed using indium or cadmiumbased nanostructured materials for which additional environmental risks are unknown bagher forecasting interactions between mature and emerging products tv technology evolution is a unique case because it allows for a fig application of the predictive model to inform ewaste policies demonstrated through estimation of cumulative waste ows in metric tons

of the two adoption trajectories each product may follows althaf et al resources conservation recycling direct assessment of how product interactions technological shifts and substitution cycles ultimately in uence ewaste ows and resource demand from a circular economy standpoint this information is critical to understand the capacity for closedloop systems in which ma terials are recovered from one type of product and returned to another of the same type such an approach may be most useful in products containing unique materials such as the cobalt contained in mobile products batteries or the rare earth phosphors used in ledlit at panel tvs as technology shifts gaps open between increasing sec ondary material supply from products that have peaked and the de mand for secondary materials by the product starting to emerge kasulaitis et al this dynamic is illustrated in fig by coupling the waste ow forecasts of oled tv with those of mature tv tech nologies presented in section tv technology forecasts are important to ce planning because these products are characterized by high mass contain materials of interest and form a signi cant part of the ewaste targeted for collection by state ewaste policies the technology shifts in this product category havehistorically created challenges in their waste management due to changing material pro les currently crt displays continue to persist in the waste stream but no closedloop solutions exist as these products are no longer on the market there is no demand in the electronics sector for the materials or components they contain lcd tvs which contain mercury in the coldcathode uorescent lamps used for back lights have also peaked in the waste stream and are beginning to decline the forecasts suggest that these tv technologies lcd and crt will become insigni cant in the waste stream in vetoten years whereas led tvs will make up a signi cant fraction of the waste ow these forecasts highlight the need to prepare for endoflife manage ment of led and oled tvs to recover critical materials like indium contained in at panel displays back into the manufacturing pipeline it is to be noted that we have assumed maximum adoption scenario ofoled tvs in this analysis and have not considered in uence of a competing technology like qled in the market which may bring itsown challenges in endoflife management of tvs as their displays are based on cadmium and indium nanostructured materials bagher chopra and theis scalbi et al these results emphasize the utility of the forecasting mfa model in understanding the im plications of interactions between mature and emerging products in the material pro le of the waste stream and associated circular economy strategies implications to ce planning applying the forecasting mfa to mature and emerging electronic products provides insights on key factors for e ective ce planning given the evolving nature of the ewaste stream and rapid pace oftechnological innovations for example the ewaste stream undergoes dematerialization when new technologies have signi cantly lower mass than products they substitute especially in the case of tvs the masscontribution of tvs in ewaste is forecasted to diminish in the next ve years mainly due to dematerialization trends babbitt et al another key trend is the decline in tv technologies that contain hazardous materials like lead and mercury where lead from crts is forecasted to drop to less than thousand metric tons by from the current level of thousand metric tons in the ewaste stream on the other hand increased demand is expected for potentially scarce mate rials like indium due to continued growth of at panel display tech nologies however combining the tv forecasts with literature estimates of indium content per tv buchert et al suggest that indium in the waste stream from lcd and led tvs may actually exceedits demand in these technologies by more than within years due to increased adoption of lighter tv technologies these trends suggest great potential for circular strategies that would close the loop on scarce materials in at panel tvs if recycling technology were devel oped to recover these materials similar potential for circularity is observed in critical metals like cobalt and lithium found in lithiumion batteries that are key components of mobile electronics for example adoption and waste ow es timates of laptops show that cobalt contained in laptop batteries in theus ewaste stream outweighs its demand in batteries for new laptop computers a product where sales are slowing while batteries are also becoming lighter and more material e cient in fact the projected cobalt waste ow from laptops metric tons in year is likely to soon exceed the combined cobalt demand for batteries in laptops and drones metric tons in see si tables ss for the data and calculations used in these informal estimates while these trends in material ows where material content in ewaste ex ceeds its demand indicate theoretical potential to close the materialloop in electronics implementation is limited at present by lack of ef fective recycling technologies and infrastructure this highlights the need to enable other circular economy strategies that extend product and component lifespan such as product reuse repair refurbishment and remanufacturing the methods developed in the present study can support these ce strategies through estimations of product waste ows that represent the products available after primary use for life spanextension or material recovery measures however consumer educa tion and implementation of e ective ewaste policies and collection systems are key in ensuring circular endoflife pathways to recover used products from consumers and for enabling all aspects of ce in cluding reuse repair remanufacturing and recycling gaustad et al the study ndings also imply the need to shift the focus of endof life management of electronics away from massbased diversionfig the evolving us tv waste ow re ecting multiple generations of technology substitution and its implication on reducing the ewaste stream due to light weighting over times althaf et al resources conservation recycling mechanisms and towards a broader perspective on sustainable mate rials management the projected trends in ewaste generation empha size the need to move away from the use of policy where all materials are treated equally to explore alternate methods for setting collection targets such as those based on environmental or economic savings associated with the circular economy a holistic waste management approach was proposed by anshassi et al in which they de monstrated use of life cycle inventorynormalized collection targets forsolid waste management in florida similar waste management me chanisms are worth exploring in the electronics sector as it will shift the focus to materials and products with the greatest bene t for re covery via circular economy initiatives in electronics a similar approach was proposed by wang and gaustad to prioritize eco nomic value energy saving potentials and ecotoxicity in prioritizingmaterial recovery from printed circuit boards however planning for such policy targets requires product level sustainability analysis the key barrier being the lack of comprehensive knowledge on environ mental and economics tradeo s associated with material use and ma terial recovery topics that should be prioritized in future study conclusions for ce strategies to keep pace with the rapid pace of innovation in the electronics sector proactive tools are needed to generate near term forecasts of resource demand and ewaste ows this study contributes a novel method for informing circular economy planning in the electronics sector the key contribution of this model is the use of historic sales data for over products to create futureoriented sales curves that can then be used to forecast demand and waste ow of products irrespective of their historic data availability application of the modelto mature and emerging electronic products helped identify nearterm challenges and opportunities for ce planning this model is exible and with appropriate validation can be used to study other product categories and a broader range of consumer electronics the model also provides a sca old on which other circular economy metrics can be built coupling product ows with material pro le data and sustain ability impacts associated with speci c materials while material ow forecasts for emerging products based on generalized trends can beburdened with uncertainty this study takes the view that we cannot wait until data are perfected or otherwise proactive opportunities to implement circular economy strategies will be lost acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge and thank hema madaka mosunmola odulate and dr erinn ryen for their assistance in elec tronic
