vol journal of material cycles and waste management  original article circular economy model framework in the european water and wastewater sector marzena smol christian adam micha preisner received august accepted december the authors abstract one of the key elements in the transformation towards a circular economy ce is providing more sustainable practices for resources and waste management improvement actions focused on transformation towards a ce should be targeted at all groups of materials and waste as water is essential for human survival and wellbeing and plays a significant role in sustainable development sd the actions related to the reuse of water and the recovery of raw materials from wastewater and other waterbased waste should be taken the paper presents a proposition for a new ce model framework in the water and wastewater sector which includes the six following actions r eductionprevent wastewater generation in the first place by the reduction of water usage and pollution reduction at source reclamation removalan application of effective technologies for the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater reusereuse of wastewater as an alternative source of water supply nonpotable usage recyclingrecovery of water from wastewater for potable usage recoveryrecovery of resources such as nutrients and energy from waterbased waste and rethinkrethinking how to use resources to create a sustainable economy which is free of waste and emissions the novelty of the proposed ce model framework is that it presents possible ways of implementing ce principles in the water and wastewater sector with a strong emphasis not only technological but also organisational and societal changes application of the proposed model may help to further transform the european economy to the ce model moreover the indicated model can be significant tool supporting an assessment of local or regional progress towards ce in the water and wastewater sector and further environmental management and planning keywords circular economy ce zero waste waste management wastewater european union eu introduction transformation towards a circular economy ce has become a popular and important issue in environmental management in recent years the ce concept is a global strategy which was introduced first into china in as the key strategy for the national development plan in the european economy the ce concept was adopted in in the first communication concerning the ce towards a circular economy a zero waste programme for europe the european commission ec defined the ce as a system which keeps the added value in products for as long as possible and eliminates waste in in the second communication closing the loopan eu action plan for the circular economy an extended definition was provided ce is a system where the value of products materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible and the generation of waste is minimised in the given definitions two important aspects play a key rolemore rationale use of resources and waste management it should be noted that the improvement actions should be tar geted at all groups of resources and waste in every branch of industry in this context more rationale usage of water resources which are under pressure and more sustainable practices of wastewater are expected as a way towards the ce in the water and wastewater sector marzena smol smolmeeripl agh university of science and technology antoniego gramatyka str cracow poland department materials and the environment bundesanstalt fr materialforschung undprfung bam unter den eichen berlin germany polish academy of sciences mineral and energy economy research institute wybickiego a str cracow poland journal of material cycles and waste management water and wastewater management is one of the biggest challenges for the ce as many kinds of industries depend on water and a limited access to clean water resources can limit both production capacity and profits moreover a disposal of wastewater which can cause environmental damage is an inherent element of water management as more than half of the global freshwater km per year is released into the environment as wastewater in the form of municipal and industrial effluent and agricultural drainage water the remaining of global freshwater km per year is mainly consumed by agriculture through evaporation in irrigated cropland to prevent contamination of the environment by insufficiently treated wastewater introduced into natural receivers the european union eu introduces systematic changes in the structure of waterbased waste disposal practices which are impor tant elements of the water management on the european level the ec is working on common principles to coordinate member states efforts to improve the protection of european waters in terms of quantity and quality to promote more sustainable water usage to protect aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands directly depending on them to contribute to the control of transboundary water problems and to safeguard and develop the potential uses of community waters the ce assumptions adopted by the ec could strengthen actions recommended in water and wastewater directives to protect water resources and environment in europe but this requires a new approach to water and wastewater management and development and implementation of innovation however not only in technologies but also in organisation policies society and finance structures in recent decades water scarcity which is a consequence of increased urbanization or climatic variability has forced people to take action to reduce pressure on water resources mainly through the reduction of water demand anyway this practice alone is not sufficient to maintain the quality of life that highquality water services are necessary therefore further efforts should be sought that will make it possible to lessen the pressure on water resources while limiting the occurrence of wastewater and if it arisesto use the most efficient methods of its treatment to protect the health and life of people and the environment moreover water and wastewater disposal is a significant part of the path to a ce model due to water being a carrier of materials eg nutrients as phosphorus and nitrogen and energy integrated initiatives should be proposed to intensify the implementation of the ce principles in water and wastewater sector in many cases the sustainable management of water resources is not sufficient because the production service and domestic activities still generate large amounts of waste water that must be managed therefore special attention should be paid to the wastewater disposal practices as it is a part of waste management in practice a number of waste prevention methods are available and they are summarized as the socalled rs reductionprevent wastewater generation in the first place by the reduction of water usage and pollution reduction at source and reusereuse of wastewater as an alternative source of water supply rs reduction reuse and recycling recovery or reclamation of water from wastewater for potable or nonpotable usage and rs reduction reuse recycling and recoveryrecovery of resources as nutrients and energy from waterbased waste in the current paper a circular economy model framework for the water and wastewater sector is proposed based on the mentioned waste prevention rules reduction reuse recycling and recovery and also two additional aspects reclamation removalfocused on highly effective removal of pollutants widely used in water and sewage management and rethinkwhich is the basis for introducing systematic changes in the whole value chain the overall goal of this paper is to develop a model framework covering the possibilities of applying circular economy principles in the water and wastewater sector the structure of the current work is as follows presentation of the main aspects of the ce model in the eus water and wastewater sectormethods used in this paperclarifying the importance of management of resources and waste in the ce modelclarifying the ce approach in the water and sewage sectorcharacteristics of the proposed ce model framework for the water and wastewater sectorconclusions methods and scope the current study is divided into two parts the first part is a summary of the state of knowledge in the research area showing the importance of implementing the ce approach in the water and wastewater sector special attention is paid to the management practices of waste generated in the wastewater sector there is a wide spectrum of possible actions in a closed cycle through better management of both water and further raw materials eg phosphorus which are present in the wastewater environment in the second part of the research the circular economy model framework in water and wastewater sector has been developed it was proposed based on the identification of the role of integration of all possible actions such as a reduction of wastewater generation wastewater reuse and recycling removal of hazardous pollutants and recovery of valuable materials from wastewater the presented ce model framework includes the fol lowing elements reduction reclamation removal reuse journal of material cycles and waste management recycling recovery and rethink an integration of these solu tions is proposed as a path towards ce in the water and wastewater sector the proposed model is recommended based on a com prehensive review of world literature the selection of primary literature was based on fulltext databases elsevier scopus elsevier sciencedirect web of knowledge wiley online google scholar eurlex eurostat and available publications the choice of literature was associated with the use of a few keywords waste management water wastewater sewage circular economy ce reuse recycling removal reclamation recovery which have been selected by the team of four expertsone technological scientist an economist a productionline manager and a representative from an environmental organization the amount of used reviewed articles reached documents there are also eu official documents as communications eu directives and regulations documents international reports documents and statistic reports documents used in the review an important source of data comes from the waste framework directive fig eu statistics report fig the report water and circular economy white paper of the ellen macarthur foundation table the proposed model was developed based on the articles reviewed and the research carried out by the authors of this publication fig the importance of waste management in the ce model waste management is one of the most significant priori ties in the eu the general framework for waste management is provided by council directive ec on waste waste framework directive ec which established the waste hierarchy set out the basic waste management definitions including defining when a byproduct is not waste and endofwaste status is reached it forced eu countries to take necessary measures to recover reuse and recycle waste and created a european recycling society controlled hazardous waste through a ban on the mixing of hazardous waste with the exception of household waste and established principles such as extended producer responsibility epr and the polluter pays principle the ec underlined that the most important objective of the eu waste policy is to minimise the negative effects of the generation and management of waste on human health and the environment moreover the waste policy is also designed to reduce the use of resources and favour the practical application of the waste hierarchy the adopted scheme for a waste management hierarchy with an indication of water and wastewater aspects is presented in fig it estab lishes a priority order for prevention preparation for reuse recycling and energy recovery through to disposal such as landfilling the main goal of the eu in realising the hierarchy presented is to achieve sustainable development in waste management leading to a reduction of its generation and the safe recovery of waste it is in line with the ce model and a zero waste strategy which is one of the most visionary concepts for solving waste problems by striving for zero waste of resources energy materials human zero emissions water air soil zero waste in activities production administration zero waste

has to be pointed out that even in a highly circular model some elements of linearity will remain due to the fact that virgin resources are required and residual waste is disposed of the ec is working on documents which have set the con text for many of the policy instruments to be implemented and could therefore be considered the most significant drivers in the changes seen in the waste management sector one of the most important documents in relation to the transition to the ce model in the waste sector next to the waste directive is the ce package which estab lishes a concrete and ambitious programme of action for the whole cycle production consumption waste management marketing of secondary raw materials and a revised legislative proposal on waste which sets clear targets for the reduction of waste and establishes a credible longterm path for waste management and recycling in the ce action plan the ec declared to revise provisions to promote greater use of economic instruments develop and improve the general requirements for epr schemes simplify and harmonise the definitions and calculation methods and step up its work with all member states to improve waste management on the ground including avoiding overcapacity in residual waste treatment moreover the ec also declared to assist eu countries and regions in ensuring that cohesion policy investments in the waste sector contribute to supporting the targets of eu waste legislation and are guided by the european waste hierarchy in the ec proposed the monitoring framework for measuring the transformation towards the ce in european countries since the economy is a very wideranging concept eg it applies to all branches of industry there is no indicator that can be a single measurement for the ce however several existing indicators could be helpful in measuring performance in selected areas that directly or indirectly contribute to the development of a ce the ec proposed to group those indicators into the four follow ing categories production and consumption waste management secondary raw materials competitiveness and innovation the data regarding the ce indicators were adopted in the official european statistics and are available in the eurostat databases in the waste management group two indicators were proposed fig total freshwater abstraction by public water supply in the selected eu member states million m journal of material cycles and waste management overall recycling ratesthe recycling rate of municipal waste and all waste apart from major mineral waste the recycling rates for specific waste streamsthe recy cling rate for overall packaging waste plastic packaging wood packaging waste electrical and electronic equipment recycled biowaste per capita and the recovery rate of construction and demolition waste the first results of the adopted ce action plan in the waste sector indicate that waste management generally shows positive developments inter alia eu recycling rates for municipal waste increased from in to in yet with significant room for improvement and differences between member states and across waste streams these indicators will be regularly monitored by the commission in the years to identify key trends and patterns by monitoring this is the key element in understanding how the various elements of the ce are developing over time to help to identify the success factors in the individual eu countries and to assess whether sufficient action has been taken the results of monitoring the waste management systems should form the basis for setting new priorities towards the longterm objective of a ce in the waste sector circular economy approach in the water and wastewater sector water is essential for human survival and wellbeing and plays a significant role in sustainable development and cir cular economy it is a renewable resource since the amount on earth always remains the same as water continuously works its way through the water cycle water is a key element not only in the life of the planets inhabitants but it plays a very important role in many sectors of the economy as agriculture production heating and cooling tourism and other service sectors as it is an extremely valuable source it must be used in a sustainable way however as a consequence of human activity and economic development water resources are under pressure therefore the protection of water resources has become an important topic of many environmental debates and is indicated in numerous documents and strategies for development at the regional national european and even global levels many aspects of water issues were incorporated in the sustainable development goals sdgs adopted in as sgdzero hunger end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture sdgclean water and sanitation ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all sgdaffordable and clean energy ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all sgd life below water conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development and other the inclusion of water issues in sdgs was made possible thanks to the longterm hard work of various stakeholders involved in the implementation of sustainable development principles as policy makers nongovernmental organisations ngos individual companies academia and research centres and society on the european level water management has changed over the past years the eu member states have made significant progress in improving water quality in european freshwater reservoirs adopting eu legislation in particular the water framework directive the urban waste water treatment directive and the drinking water directive these key legal acts form the basis of the eus com mitment to improving water status in europe one of the achievements is the significant improvement of water quality in the european freshwater and coastal bathing in the last four decades in over bathing areas were inspected across the eu countries of them met the most stringent standards confirming the excellent state of water thanks to the provisions laid down in eu legisla tion concerning the quality of bathing and wastewater eu member states have managed to solve the problem of bathing water pollution through the discharge of wastewater or water from agricultural land which posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems however despite the progress made the overall state of many european water bodies is still uncertain currently renewable freshwater resources in the eu calculated as the sum of internal flow and exter nal inflow are equal to million m per year and they differ between the member states the freshwater availability in a given country depends on climate conditions and transboundary water flows external flows as can be seen from fig the greatest quantities of freshwater resources annual average available waterltaa are noted in the developed countries such as sweden germany france and united kingdom uk while in the european free trade association efta and candidate countries higher longterm averages were recorded for norway on the european level there is also interesting phenomena related to the development of freshwater abstraction by public water supply it is shown in fig that for selected eu member states that between and there was a marked decrease in water abstraction in countries that joined the eu in or eg bulgaria poland this fact is affected by various factors in different countries as reduction of water losses by improved maintenance of the networks implementation of watersaving household equipment increasing level of awareness about the importance of water and its cost and the environmental consequences of wasting this valuable resourcejournal of material cycles and waste management anyway the abstraction rates were relatively stable in countries as belgium and the netherlands which are the majority of the remaining member states according to the latest european environmental agency eea water europe report the vast majority of lakes rivers river estuaries and coastal waters in europe have problems with achieving the eu target of a minimum of good ecological status of the eu set in the eu framework water directive the objective of eu policy is to significantly reduce the negative effects of pollution excessive water abstraction and other factors exerting pressure on water and to ensure a sufficient amount of good water quality for both people and the environment the improvement actions focused also on the management of wastewater in recent years wastewater treatment and the reduction of the use of nitrogen n and phosphorus p in agriculture have led in particular to a significant improvement in water quality it should be pointed that the ec seeks to harmonize the situation at european level so that there are no such differ ences in individual countries and even regions for example in poland in the financial perspective for in which applications are still being submitted there are a number of possibilities for financing investments in the water and sewage sector in addition an increased support was allocated to less developed regions such as eastern poland mainly rural communities which should make it possible to adapt the situation in this region in the field of water and wastewater management to other more developed regions of the country and other european countries the ec emphasis the importance of sustainable man agement of water and wastewater as one of the elements in the transition towards the circular economy the first ec communication on the ce is strongly connected with waste management as it focuses on the zero waste strategy the main circular approaches in waste management have been proposed in this document it was indicated that the sustainable resource management includes interactions within waste water energy and raw materials in this context integration of activities in terms of both wateras a resource and wasteas a source of raw materials and energy should be developed and implemented in general improvement actions in the water management should be proposed but alsoin the management of waterbased waste to recover raw materials and energy occurring in it the ec also pointed out that waste generated in the water and wastewater sector as wastewater sewage sludge or sewage sludge ash is an important source of biogenic raw materials one of the most important biogenic raw material is phosphorus which is a limited source for the european econ omy it is indicated as a critical raw material crm due to its high economic and strategic importance associated with a high supply risk europe has very limited primary resources of p and is dependent on outside providers for phosphate rock and for phosphorus therefore the ec considers developing a policy framework on phosphorus to enhance its recycling foster innovation improve market conditions and mainstream its sustainable use in eu legislation on fertilizer food water and waste moreover the ec indicated other specific waste challenges for the water and wastewater sector eg full implementation of the measures in the revised eu waste legislation package by and by could positively affect marine waters quality setting a dedicated reduction target for would give a clear signal to european countries currently developing measures to achieve good environmental status for marine waters by the deadline under the marine strategy framework directive and would provide an impetus for the development of marine litter action plans within the four regional sea conventions the ec indicated some key aspects of water and wastewater management from the point of view of zero waste strategy anyway no more recommendations have been proposed in first european ce communication in the second ce communication the ec pro posed actions including initiatives related to the water and wastewater sector due to water scarcity has worsened in some parts of the eu in previous decades with damaging effects on the european environment and economy boosting the market for secondary raw materials and water reuse is proposed next to the waterefficiency measures the reuse of treated wastewater in safe and costeffective conditions is recommended it is a valuable however underused means of increasing water supply and alleviating pressure on overexploited water resources in europe the importance of water reuse in agriculture was underlined due to it contributes to nutrients recycling by substitution of solid fertilizers therefore the ec proposed many actions to promote the reuse of treated wastewater including legislation on minimum requirements for reused water the following waterrelated proposals have been presented in this communication in the area of the market for secondary raw materials proposed legislation setting minimum requirements for reused water for irrigation and groundwater recharge promotion of safe and costeffective water reuse including guidance on the integration of water reuse in water planning and management inclusion of best practices in relevant best available techniques reference document brefs and support to innovation through the european innovation partnership and horizon and investments both initiatives have been included in the european com missions work programmes from they should contribute to the political priorities set by the ec to promote a journal of material cycles and waste management more circular economy other key legislative proposals on fertilizers are also pointed in this case the recycled nutrients are indicated with strong emphasis on the phosphorus recovery from waterbased waste in the proposal laying down rules on the making available on the market of ce marked fertilizing products has been published and in the regulation laying down rules on the mak ing available on the market of eu fertilizing products has been adopted fertilizers produced from waste meeting quality safety and labelling requirements and limits of organic microbiological and physical contaminants will be able to be traded freely within the eu and receive the ce marking in the previous mentioned communication on monitoring framework for measuring the transformation towards the ce in the eu which has been published in january the ce indicators have been proposed only for selected groups of waste among these groups no aspects were considered that are related to the measurement of circularity in the water and wastewater sector which is one of the most important considerations for health and social life in future the list of ce indicators should be extended to issues related to the reuse of water and the recovery of raw materials and energy from wastewater sewage sludge and sewage sludge ash and other waterbased waste in may the ec presented new rules to stimulate and facilitate water reuse in the eu for agricultural irrigation the general objective is to contribute to alleviating water scarcity across the eu in the context of adaptation to climate change notably by increasing the uptake of water reuse in particular for agricultural irrigation wherever this is relevant and costeffective while ensuring the maintenance of a high level of public health and environmental protection in general reuse of treated wastewater shows lower environmental impact than for example water transfers or desalination moreover it offers a range of economic environmental and social benefits and it extends the water life cycle thereby helping to preserve water resources which is in full compliance with the ce objectives the proposed regulation in combination with other nonregulatory actions as outlined in the ce action plan is a proportionate response to the specific objective of fostering the development of safe reuse of treated wastewater the treated wastewater could be used for a wide variety of purposes by many industries eg in agriculture in agricultural irrigation was mentioned as the main potential source of demand for reused water due to the high potential in terms of its higher uptake scarcity alleviation and european relevance in the report on the implementation of the ce action plan which has been published in march the ec underlined that water management is an important part of the transformation towards ce the proposed in circular actions seek to boost the market for reused water to tackle water scarcity across europe therefore in the dedicated legislation setting minimum requirements for reused water for agricultural irrigation was proposed it should be also pointed that practices on water reuse are integrated into water planning and management or in the review of the relevant best available techniques refer ence documents brefs summarizing all presented information it can be stated that water plays a critical role in the worlds transition from the linear consumption of resources towards their circular use water issues are incorporated into the ce model due to water being a carrier of materials and energy therefore it is important to develop and implement technologies focused on water reuse or recovery of resources and energy in water and sewage management in accordance with the nutrientsenergywater paradigm new moreover the relationship between ce principles and water systems management needs to be identified and dis seminated among individuals organisations and companies to integrate their efforts in this area the watercircular economy relationship was presented in the white paper developed by the ellen macarthur foundation in this foundation is one of the most important actor in the transition process to the ce in europe it published a lot of reports and documents on ce presenting the main ce approaches ce models and white papers dedicated to specific sectors or areas the most important assumptions of the water and circular economy white paper are presented in table they include design of waste externalities with the strong focus on optimization of water and energy minerals and chemicals usage keeping the resources in use with focus on the optimiza tion of resource yields and energy or resource extraction from the water system regeneration of natural capital by the reduction of consumption and nonconsuming use of water the white paper focuses on the presentation of main ce principles and their connections to the sustainable water management including key intersection topics as indication of water as a carrier of chemicals particles and droplets dissolved and suspended state which could be treated as a potential resource or pollutant as it was mentioned before water is a carrier of biogenic raw materials therefore there is high potential for recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater and produce the ferti lizers the white paper also underlines the impor tance of water in the economic systems including enter prises created value and its impact an application of ce assumptions in water and wastewater sector can bring new business models development improvement of functional journal of material cycles and waste management performance and impact and greater value and commercial opportunity currently the issues of transformation water and waste water sector to the ce model are also one of the key works of the international water association iwa in the iwa proposed the framework that may support the water utility leaders in the identification of opportunities that can boost their progress along the pathway to the ce the following approaches have been identified integrated urban resource management connecting to stakeholders beyond traditional boundaries urban and basin leadership innovation new business models the general idea assumes that water cycle needs to be managed from catchment to consumer back to catchment and the transition to the ce model needs to consider both the consumption and production of resources across this entire value chain it also must create both connections and synergies within the water cycle for more efficient water management and connections outside the sector such an integrated approach takes into account not only water management but also a waterbased waste as sewage sewage sludge sewage sludge ash and other it should be also noted that waterbased waste management via reuse or recycling may face numerous barriers such as public perception to pricing and technological regulatory and safety challenges however more sustainable management of all the above waterbased resources is necessary for the achievement of the environmental social and economic objectives indicated in the ce action plan circular economy model framework in the water and sewage sector to transform the european economy to the ce model it is necessary to provide more sustainable practices of resources and waste management this also applies to the water and wastewater sector and its basic elementswater wastewater sewage sludge sewage sludge ash and other residues as it was mentioned in practice some prevention methods are already used in waste management as rs reduction and reuse rs reduction reuse and recycling rs reduction reuse recycling and recovery as far as the implementation of the ce principles in the water and wastewater sector is concerned an extension of the existing xrs techniques cited above is proposed the proposed ce model framework includes two additional aspects reclamation removalfocused on highly effective removal of pollutants characteristic for a water and wastewater sector and rethinkwhich is the basis for introducing systematic changes in the whole value chain for water key element of the transformation toward ce in all branches of the economy all the above elements must be in the line not only with the ce assumptions but also with the waste management hierarchy therefore in the proposed model ce actions are ordered from the most desirable solution to the least recommended the exception is rethink which is applied to all other elements of the model the concept of ce model framework in the water and wastewater sector is presented in fig reduce reduce is the first option in the presented concept and the best way to save the quality of the environment it indicates that the first element in preventing wastewater generation should involve considering the reduction of water usage and pollution reduction at source through better planning and design currently human activities use over half of all accessible water runoff approx of total water use is for industrial purposes and less than is for domestic purposes households are the smallest consumers of water however they have a large potential impact as they can experiment with strategies to develop watersaving habits which can be implemented outside of the home household water use is the largest growing sector by upwards of over the next years and it is a testing ground for developing the strategies and social behavior needed to reduce water use in agriculture and industry there are several benefits arising from the reduction of water consumption such as a decrease in individual expenses and time spent acquiring water a decrease in demand for the extension of water supply systems and facilities as well as for costly wastewater treatment plant wwtp facilities and the improvement of the availability of water for other uses and purposes it should be pointed out that the environmental attitudes and environmental behavior of people at home should be transferred to workplaces however the deep literature review shows that attitude change is not necessarily a prerequisite for behavior change in the workplace this requires further raising peoples awareness of the importance of mak ing changes in every aspect of life both in households and in the workplace the society is becoming more and more environmentally aware and it could be assumed that they journal of material cycles and waste management will try to adopt some changes in their households and work places in the nearest future as a consequence of zero waste initiatives and fashion the behavior transfer creates a great opportunity to introduce the methods to reduce water consumption in companies which is particularly important in the industrial plants that depend on water consumption fig reclamation removal reclamation is associated with highly effective techniques for the removal of pollutants from wastewater and it is the second option in the presented hierarchy wastewater is treated due to the necessity for sanitation in the maximum possible number of cities towns and villages and the consequent need for safe disposal of the wastewater collected into the environment after treatment complying at the same time with the disposal regulations accord ing to the eu regulations and national laws treatment of wastewater is obligatory due to the discharge of untreated effluent in water bodies leading to eutrophication human health risks and greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the form of nitrous oxide and methane moreover treated wastewater should be reused whenever appropriate to reuse the treated wastewater it is necessary to decompose or remove dangerous substances and impurities such as microbial pathogens particulates nutrients toxic organic compounds and other matter there are several treatment options which differ from each other due to the different types of wastewater industrial municipal which require various treatment methods biological physical chemical and a combination of those methods are applied in wwtps to meet specific water quality objectives currently unit wastewater treatment operations and processes are combined together to provide primary secondary and tertiary treatment in the european wwtps of the load is treated at primary level at secondary level and at tertiary level primary treatment is related to the initial treatment processes physical and chemical secondary treatment deals with the biological treatment of wastewater and in tertiary treatment pro cesses wastewater treated by in the primary and second ary processes is converted into good quality water that can be used for different types of purposepotable drinking and nonpotable industrial in the tertiary process almost of the contaminations are removed and the water is converted into the safe quality for a specific use treated wastewater provides an alternative source of water which is extremely important in areas where water is scarce moreover from irrigation to industrial purposes to potable supply fig the ce model framework in the water and wastewater sectorjournal of material cycles and waste management wastewater treated to the required quality could replenish water supplies and reduce the availabilitydemand gap reuse reuse is the third option in the proposed model framework water can be nonpotable reused as an alternative fresh water supply in particular for agricultural irrigation urban landscape irrigation and other urban uses and industrial practices reuse of treated wastewater as an alternative source of water supply has been well recognised and embedded within international eu and national strategies the united nations un sustainable development goal on water sdg specifically targets a substantial increase in safe reuse globally by moreover water reuse is a priority area in the strategic implementation plan of the european innovation partnership on water and maximisation of water reuse is a specific objective in the commu nication blueprint to safeguard europes water resources it has been indicated that reuse of treated wastewater could bring important environmental economic and social benefits by water reuse it is possible to quantitatively improve the status of the environment alleviating pressure by substituting for abstraction and qualitatively relieving the pressure of discharges from urban wwtps to sensitive areas compared to alternative sources of water such as desalination or water transfer in many cases water reuse requires lower investment costs and energy treated wastewater can also be reused in agriculture in particular providing a reliable continuity of water supply during the irrigation period it can reduce the risk of crop failure and income loss another important aspect is the use of treated wastewater with a controlled level of nutrients which can also reduce the use of additional fertilizers thus bringing further benefits in the form of savings for farmers and the environment and reducing the need for wastewater treatment according to information provided by the ec water reuse contributes to the broader water sector which has been indicated as a key component of the european ecoindustrial landscape the global water market has been growing rapidly in recent years and it is estimated that it will reach trillion euros by taking into account the above forecast water reuse provides a significant potential in terms of the creation of new green jobs in waterrelated industry it is estimated that a rise in the rate of growth of the water industry in the eu could create up to thousand new jobs an example of water recuse in the wastewater sector is the use of water grey water that enters the drains from showers and sinks in houses for irrigation purposes the rest of the water socalled black water can be applied for irrigation after going through a conventional primary or secondary wastewater treatment process eg filtration or disinfection wastewater treated in this way is recycled and can be used to irrigate golf courses cemeteries parks and other landscaping another example of water recycling is the use of rainwater that is collected or harvested from stormwater drainage systems in urban areas this includes rainwater runoff from buildings roads and open land which is usually evacuated by drains recycling recycling is the fourth option in the proposed ce model water recycling is related to the recovery or reclamation of water from wastewater for potable drinking usage which can be supplied back to the water system either directly or indirectly although recycling does help to conserve resources and reduce waste it should be noted that there are high economic and environmental costs associated with wastewater collection and recycling therefore recy cling should only be considered for wastewater which cannot be reduced or reused in the water recycling high effective technologies for the removal of pollutants from wastewater must be applied as for example membrane techniquesnanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro or forward osmosis fo membrane technology has been used for the water recycling from palm oil mill effluent pome this technique shows high potential for eliminating the environmental problem and in addition this alternative treatment system offers water recycling the treated effluent is characterized by high quality and crystalclear water that can be used as the source of drinking water production or the boiler feed water recovery the recovery of materials is the fifth option in the proposed model wastewater has considerable potential to support circular approaches due to the wealth of potentially recov erable resources in wastewaterincluding inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus organic fertilizers biogas biopolymers heat cellulose heavy metals pharmaceutical products and water the aspect of the recovery of nutrients is indicated in the first implementing regulation of the ce action plan a proposal laying down rules on the making available of ce marked fertilizer products on the market one of the most important elements which can be recovered in the wastewater sector is phosphorus precovery potential appears in several places in wwtps such as wastewater outflow from the treatment plant sedimentary liquid leachate dehydrated sewage sludge and sewage sludge ash in each of the subsequent processes of wastewater treatment and sewage sludge processing a smaller volume of the substrate used for the recycling of p is obtained however the concentration of p per unit volume increases and reaches up to g pkg dry matter dm one journal of material cycles and waste management of the most promising methods is the recovery of p in the form of struvite from the liquid phase of wastewater struvite precipitation can bring several benefitsit can improve the operation of treatment processes and helps to reduce the environmental impacts of effluent discharge on receiving water bodies moreover it can secure a renewable supply of p which is a critical raw material for the european economy due to there being no significant p mines existing in the eu phosphorus is imported from outside providers some of which are considered politically risky such as morocco and russia due to one of the main fertilizer constituents being phosphate rock and taking account of europes need to import more than of its requirements domestic prich waste could potentially cover about of the eus demand for phosphate fertilizers the eu has indicated that there is currently a largely unexploited investment potential remaining in relation to this a rise in recycling rates and a decrease in import dependency for p are considered essential to european agriculture and are mentioned as one of the key objectives in coming years following the revision of the eu fertilizer regulation to extend its scope to nutrients from secondary sources and organic sources other possibility of recovery of nutrients from sewage sludge is composting of it it could be used for example in urban agriculture and organic farming but also in gardens landscaping or hor ticulture anyway it should be mentioned that the composition of the sewage sludge could be complicated due to this waste stream is rich in micro and macroelements but also it could contain toxic compounds and pathogenic organisms therefore the sewage sludge treatment methods should be adopted in specific wwtps moreover the amount of sew age sludge that can be used as fertilizers is subject to limits provided in the european and national regulations rethink rethink is the last option in the adopted ce model but the most important from the perspective of transformation process towards ce which requires the holistic changes in all value chain of water and wastewater ie in all previously mentioned xr rules therefore rethink should be applied to all previously described elements of the ce model frame work the whole concept of the ce is about rethinking how to use resources to create a sustainable economy which is free from waste and emissions it requires systematic change from the current linear model of take make waste to the ce model economy where the reduce reuse recy cle recover rethink process is put into practice in the zero waste programme the ec defined the waste targets for a move to a recycling society a recyclingoriented society should be built based on the transfer of knowledge and solutions technological organisational societal and financial from more advanced regions in the realisation of ce targets currently europe has made substantial progress in turning waste into a resource and promoting sustainable ways of waste management such as recycling however performance varies considerably between european countries and regions some of them have already effectively imposed legal restrictions and installed technologies for nutrient recovery in wwtps as in switzerland and ger many in others no research is conducted in this area due to the transition to the ce model in europe public awareness is one of the major driving forces and more and more attention is paid to actions focused on change in societys way of thinking therefore new educational and promotional activities are conducted to increase the level of public knowledge of the importance of water protection it should bring a change in behavior of all consumers as a significant factor in the passage from a linear to a cir cular economy transformation towards the ce in the water and sewage sector should take into account an integrated approach to water management by increasing the scope and division of responsibilities incumbent on administrations and integration with other fields including energy transport navigation agriculture forestry fishing nature protection in the broad sense tourism social communication spatial planning as well as regional policy the novelty of the presented circular economy model framework is that it presents possible ways of implementing ce principles in the water and wastewater sector including the importance not only technological but also organi sational and societal changes its application may help the european economy further transform into the ce model it is extremely important for wateraddicted companies and wastewater operators due to their ecologically aware decisions regarding the implementation of sustainable and cir cular solutions in water and wastewater sector can speed up the process of transformation toward ce it should be clearly underlined that the circular economy is now an irreversible global trend on a large scale the european commission strongly indicates that efforts need to be intensified at national eu and global levels to fully close the loop and take advantage of the competitive advantage that the circular economy provides for eu businesses all mentioned water protection conservation reuse and recycling methods next to materials recovery solutions produce substantial environmental benefits arising from reductions in water diversions and reductions in the impacts of wastewater discharges on environmental water quality these directions of waste and wastewater management are in line with both ce concept and the strategic direction for eu environmental policy outlined by the th environmental action programme eap adopted in and in the targets defined in the europe strategy which plans to turn the eu into a smart sustainable and inclusive economy deliv ering high levels of employment productivity and social journal of material cycles and waste management cohesion in setting the vision for it refers to the ce where nothing is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably the transition to the ce will also help to meet the objectives of the agenda for sustainable development due to it encourages a more efficient use of water and waterbased waster in this context the ce perspective may bring water and wastewater innovation that supports the implementation of the proposed ce model framework for the water and wastewater sector moreover the indicated model can be a significant tool supporting an assessment of local or regional progress towards ce in the water and wastewater sector and further environmental management and planning conclusions management of water and wastewater is an important part of the ce model due to many industries depends on water and it is a carrier of materials and energy the ec underlines the importance of water and wastewater disposal practices in the ce documents which indicates that the ce objectives can be achieved in water and wastewater sector through more sustainable management of water resources more rational disposal and processing of wastewater and other waterbased waste in some cases the sustainable management of water resources is not enough to reach ce objectives due to the production service and domestic activities still generate large amounts of wastewater that must be disposed therefore special attention is paid to wastewater disposal which is an integral part of waste management in this paper the circular economy model framework for waterbased waste management is proposed it includes six following actions ways helpful in the implementation of ce principles in the water and wastewater sector reductionprevent wastewater generation in the first place by the reduction of water usage and pollution reduction at source reclamation removal application of effective technologies for the removal of pollutants from water and sewage reusereuse of treated wastewater as an alternative source of water supply for nonpotable usage recyclingrecovery of water from wastewater for pota ble usage recoveryrecovery of resources as nutrients and energy from waterbased waste rethinkrethinking how to use resources to create a sustainable economy which is free of waste and emissionsthe novelty of the presented ce model framework con cerns the integration of all possible ways of implementation of ce principles in the water and wastewater sector including technological organisational and societal changes application of the proposed model may help the european economy to make further transformations towards the ce model acknowledgements this work was
