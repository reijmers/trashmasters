Decision-making plays an important role during the risk assessment in e-waste recycling. This study aims to develop a decision tool under uncertain and risky conditions for achieving sustainability in electronic waste  recycling in circular economy. Prospect theory and its aspects are integrated with the sustainability risk assessment in e-waste recycling. In order to evaluate the irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers in a risky and uncertain environment, the prospect theory-based TODIM (acronym in Portuguese for inter - active and multicriteria decision-making, i.e. Tomada de Decisão Interativa Multicritério) method for a previous computer disassembly problem is used. Using prospect theory, the relationship between loss aversion, reference point, framing and two selves effect, and sustainability dimensions is presented with a sustainability risk assessment point of view. Further, tasks of computer disassembly processes are prioritized by considering risk factors. The results showed that random access memory modules, motherboard and power supply are the highest priority risks based on the evaluation of listed twelve sustainability risks. In this study, it is suggested that prospect theory is suitable for decisions under risk and uncertainty, and it is applicable to integrate sustainability risk assessment and prospect theory in order to fulfil the gap of knowledge.

There is a direct relationship between the consumption rates of electronic goods and the amount of generated electronic waste . Due to shrinking product life cycles, e-waste is a dynamic category of waste, as the new models of the products are introduced to the market, the consumers tend to purchase the latest versions, and therefore, adaptive recycling methods are needed . This rapid growth in e-waste leads to the circular economy and sustainability-related concerns in terms of impacts on environment, society and economy. More research is needed focusing on e-waste recycling  activities . Advantages of e-waste recycling were categorized under economic, environmen-tal and public health and safety benefits . Four economic benefits of e-waste recycling are, firstly, recovery of e-waste with an estimated value of £ 48 billion, and based on value the recovered metals include copper, gold, silver, palladium, aluminium and iron. Sec-ondly, concentration of metals in the e-waste stream is considerably higher than in the mining operations. Thirdly, e-waste provides the opportunity for reusing rare natural elements including gallium and indium. Finally, e-waste industry creates jobs and economic opportunities. In addition, three main environmental benefits of e-waste recycling are: Firstly, it reduces risks of disposal keeping hazardous waste out of landfills. Secondly, it decreases demand for new metal production and consequently reduces greenhouse emissions caused by metal production and finally energy saving by e-waste recycling. Adding to that, main public health and safety benefits of e-waste recycling are further stated as, the reduction in harmful effects of e-waste on public health and safety, including skin problems, damage to organs and bone structure, prob-lems in nervous system, etc. Among advantages or benefits of e-waste recycling,  e-waste management is a complex activity. Managing e-waste contains many hazardous materials, and the pro-cess of e-waste recycling involves significant risks to the environment, human safety and business  and also for circular economy. Moreover, recy - cling of e-waste, which is one of the effective strategies of circular economy, directly benefits to circular economy and it is crucial to have circular economy approach to gain more value based on sustainability .  Therefore, a systematic approach is essential to evalu-ate risks of e-waste . In this sense, treatment of the e-waste is the most important subject in terms of minimizing negative impacts. Structured risk assessment for e-waste recycling is essential to under - stand the impacts on society and environment . With this view, sustainability risk assessment   of e-waste recycling would be beneficial to deal with environmental, social and economic risks in an indus - trial context. Different risks of e-waste recycling require crucial deci- sions due to the presence of uncertainty in the process. Decision-making plays an important role during the SRA, as assessing risks further seen as the main domain of such process . However, decision-making attitudes of human are usually neglected, and a theoretical integration is missing. From this point of view, research question for this study is  stated as: “How shall we incorporate decision making under risk and irrationality within SRA for e-waste recycling?” This research aims to develop a decision-making method  in uncertain and risky conditions in e-waste recycling sys-tem. To achieve this aim, firstly prospect theory, which is a behavioural theory that considers decision-making under uncertainty and risk, is proposed to examine sustainability risks of e-waste recycling. Secondly, a prospect theory-based multicriteria decision method, TODIM , is used to evaluate listed risks. In order to show the applicability of this work, a computer disassembly problem is used as a case study, where computer disassembly tasks are evalu-ated according to relevant sustainability risks. Therefore, the novel point in this study is to evaluate the risks to the sus-tainability, within a system approach by integrating SRA and prospect theory to consider irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers within the risky and uncertain nature of e-waste recycling system. This study is structured as follows: in “Sustainability risk  assessment  in e-waste recycling” section, the SRA in e-waste recycling is presented. In “Prospect theory” section, the details of prospect theory are given. In “Integration of SRA with prospect theory based TODIM” section, the inte-gration of SRA and prospect theory is explained. “ TODIM  method” section gives the details of methodology, and “Case study” section presents the case study. “Results” section cov - ers the discussion and conclusions. Sustainability risk assessment   in e‑waste recycling Sustainability is used for describing the conditions of the  society, environment and economy . From the risk assessment point of view, sustainability risks have  Risk assessment for sustainability in e -waste recycling in circular economy   1 3 become growing concern for organizations. Thus, adequate  risk assessment procedure is essential to deal with such risks. From managerial context, the SRA should be applied aligning environmental, social and economic risks under the roof of sustainability perspective . Further, Aziz et al.  defined sustainability risks as ethical concerns related to social and environmental effects of organizational transactions. Dumay and Hossain  suggested that SRA provides key information for companies and stakeholders to evaluate the performance of processes. The climate change, population growth, rapid technologi-cal developments and unpredictable sustainability risks are some of the reasons that increase the importance of SRA . Sustainability risks threaten  the sustainable development of organizations causing long-term environmental, economic and social impacts. There - fore, identification and control of these sustainability risks by SRA are important for achieving sustainability goals . Sustainability plays an important role during the entire  life cycle of system development, starting from raw material selection and use, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, distribution to customer, use, maintenance and finally dis-posal and recycle phases, where there is always a sustain-ability risk and a continuous SRA is essential . However, assessing sustainability risks on all levels is also beneficial for reducing the possibility of problems and helps to achieve sustainable development objectives . As in line with this view, this study focuses on  one of growing global problem, e-waste recycling, where SRA is important to deal with the environmental, social and economic impacts of e-waste and threats on the circular economy. E-waste is a hazardous concept for human health, envi- ronment and businesses. To manage risks of e-waste, a sys-tematic process is needed to identify sustainability focused risks . In this regard, SRA is applicable due to its holistic structure combining sustainability dimen-sions during risk assessment. The Directive of the European Parliament and of Council divides the WEEE into ten cat-egories, large household appliances, small household appli - ances, monitoring and control instruments, medical equip-ment systems, electronic toys, electrical and electronic tools, lighting equipment, consumer equipment and information technology and telecommunications equipment . After 2015, new Catalogue of WEEE Recycling was  published, in which the following more categories were added: range hood, electric water heater, gas water heater, printer, copier, fax machine, monitor, mobile phone and single-machine telephone . E-waste includes a high variety of materials and con- tains a wide range of toxic substances that can contaminate environment and threaten human health and safety . E-waste is different from other industrial wastes,  chemically and physically, where it includes both hazard-ous and valuable materials that need special handling and recycling methods . If e-waste is recycled or disposed without proper controls, negative impacts on environment and human safety are inevitable and also pro-vide benefits for the circular economy. Moreover, the biggest advantages of the circular economy approach are to pro-pose a regenerative system for e-waste recycling . Therefore, using SRA approach during e-waste  recycling is beneficial for organizations and society to have systematic benefits. Disposal of e-waste includes three main phases: the  collection of the e-waste, the pre-treatment, including the activities as disassembly, separation of parts and shredding and finally extraction and purification of the valuable parts for recycling . The process of the separation of parts of e-waste can be done by using the automated machines or manually . Espe-cially, in developing countries, dismantling and recycling activities are performed manually, which leads to generation of chemicals and plastics into the environment via water, air and soil . According to the study of Widmer et al. , e-waste contains more than 1000 types of substances, many of which are toxic, such as mer - cury, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, hexavalent chromium and flame retardants. Examples of hazardous chemicals in e-waste are: heavy metals and metalloids including barium, mercury, copper, etc., brominated flame retardants including exabromo cyclodo decane  and polybrominated diphenyl ethers , plastics including bisphenol‐ A,  polychlorinated biphenyls  and lead glass . However, the potential health  risks of e-waste affect each part of the human body, includ-ing central nervous system, digestive and urinary system, reproductive and endocrine system, respiratory system, blood, skeleton, and immune system, as summarized in the report of UN Environment . Among studies of specific group of e-waste, Lim and  Schoenung  draw attention to the effects of cellu-lar phones wastes on human health and ecology and used triple bottom line  approach and named dimen-sions as consumer responsibility, corporate responsibility and government responsibility. Consumer responsibility includes environmentally responsible purchase behaviour and return products to recycling processes, whereas corpo-rate responsibility focuses on design for environment, the take back system, environmental performance declaration, technology development and compliance with environ - mental regulations, and finally, government responsibility emphasizes the establishment of systems and institutions for waste management, coordination of stakeholders and environmental education . The   Y. Kazancoglu et al. 1 3 study of García et al.  paid special attention on end- of-life computers in Mexico and presented both the chemi-cal risks including toxic elements and the risks related to processes such as storing. Pinto  also focused on computers under e-waste and divided potential risks of computer waste as occupational and environmental risks, where occupational and environmental risks are itemized for each component of the computer. In their study, details of hazards are also given. For instance, under human safety hazard physical hazards are exemplified as cuts from glass, acid contact with eyes, inhalation of chemical gases and contact with phosphor. Environmental hazards are further divided as air emissions, ground water toxicity due to lead, barium, emission of dioxins and heavy metals. . In addition, a recent study by Thais et al.  was conducted for disassembly, transport and reassembly processes and the environmental risks of disassembly were defined under four subgroups: physical hazards, chemical risks, ergonomic risks and accident risks. Crush or impact, explosion, environmental impact and  environmental impact are presented as potential risks of disassembly in Liqui-Cel Membrane Contactors Disas-sembly and Assembly Manuel , in which each risk is analysed for the disassembly processes. In the Euro-pean Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road  Report , risks are further categorized as oxidizing flammable, explosive, infectious, radioactive, toxic, corrosive and spontaneous combustion. Avikal et al.  aimed to solve a dis- assembly problem, and used following criteria to evalu-ate tasks: task time, part demand, number of followers, revenue generated, part hazardous, state of material and fragility. The quality specifications/standards are also sig-nificant in recycling activities, and there are different kinds of specification for each type of waste, including e-waste, household plastic packages, batteries, etc. (Resource Asso - ciation 2017). Although it can be an accepted view that risks of  e-waste recycling can be categorized under sustainabil-ity dimensions. Yet, various knowledge gaps related to SRA have been presented by Palousis et al.  as: need for dealing with uncertainty by a risk management-based approach, the need for characterizing sustainability risk to identify and assess them, and linking entire product lifecycle with SRA. In addition to these, decision-making behaviour of human is generally neglected in SRA. How - ever, in real life, decisions are not always rational, and the decision makers can be risk neutral, risk averse or a risk seeker. Therefore, in this study, it is suggested that prospect theory is suitable for decisions under risk and uncertainty. Further, the prospect theory-based TODIM method is proposed to develop a decision tool to evaluate SRA and fulfil the gap of knowledge.Prospect theory The way of people make decisions has long been a topic of research interests. Utility theory and prospect theory are two main theories that try to define how and why people make decisions. Utility theory is based on assessing the utility of gain by comparison of the utilities of two stages of wealth, while prospect theory assumes and shows that the outcome of decision-making under conditions of gains and losses is not symmetrical . Utility theory was found as simple and lacks a mov - ing part in terms of final states of wealth. The reference point is the missing variable, which is the earlier state relative to evaluation of gains and losses. The main dif-ference between utility theory and prospect theory is that in Bernoulli’s theory to determine utility, only the state of the wealth needs to be known, while in prospect theory, additionally, the reference state need to be known. Hence, prospect theory is a more complicated theory. The three main principles of prospect theory were  explained by Kahneman  as follows: • “Evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point ,  which is sometimes referred to as an “adaptation level”. Better outcomes than reference points are named as gains, otherwise losses. • A principle of diminishing sensitivity relates to sensory dimensions and the evaluation of change of wealth. • Loss aversion is related to asymmetry between power of pain and pleasure. People generally take risks to prevent losses, where loss aversion explains variety in risk seek - ing and aversion. When directly compared or weighted against each other, “losses loom larger than gains”. Diminishing sensitivity for both gains and losses is rep - resented by a salient feature it is S-shaped. The curves of the S-shaped are not symmetrical. The slope of the func-tion differs at the reference point because reaction to losses is greater in effect than reaction to gains, which is referred as loss aversion. • In problems where both loss and gain are possible, loss aversion causes highly risk-averse choices • In problems where loss is inevitable and when com - pared to a larger loss that has low probability, diminish-ing sensitivity causes risk seeking. There are two other effects which support the use of  prospect theory in the decision-making process of e-waste recycling: Framing and Two Selves. • Framing Risk assessment for sustainability in e -waste recycling in circular economy   1 3 Basically, framing refers to process through which people  make sense of their external environment .  In other words, the approaches and reluctance of decision makers are affected by words, and it is expected that decision makers are to be biased towards the certain option in the case of KEEP, and against in case of LOSE. Therefore, prefer - ences of decision makers are frame bound, not reality bound. Depending on whether the consequences are bad or good,  different selections in the two frames appropriate for pros-pect theory. When the output is good, decision makers are inclined to choose the certain things over the gamble. On the other hand, when the output is bad, they prefer to take risk. Hence, framing effect exposes that risk averse and risk seeking choices are not reality bound. • Two selves According to utility decision viewpoint, expected utility  theory concerns the directions of rationality, which should rule decision utilities. Therefore, it is not about hedonic experiences. Kahneman  categorized experienced utility as  the experiencing self and the remembering self. In this definition, experienced utility concerns perceived pain and pleasure. The experiencing self aims to answer the question “Does it hurt now?”. On the other hand, the remembering self-answers the question “How was it, on the whole?” Further, the retrospective assessments are insensitive to  duration and emphasize the weight of two singular moments, peak and the end, much more than other moments. Peak-end rule The global retrospective rating is foreseen well by the average of the level of pain/loss at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.Duration neglect This refers to the procedures’ duration which had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total pain/loss. In this sense, the integration of SRA for e-waste recycling  activities with prospect theory is explained in the following  section. Integration of SRA with prospect theory  based TODIM The risks of e-waste recycling are studied within the scope  of SRA approach. In e-waste recycling business factors, human and environmental safety need to be considered while assessing risks. Utility theory is not suitable for decision-making under  uncertainty and risk due to its sole dependency on out-puts rather than the decision-making process. Features of prospect theory including loss aversion, reference point and diminishing sensitivity are very appropriate to explain irra-tionality and risk attitudes of decision makers. While exam-ining risks of e-waste recycling activities under sustainabil - ity dimensions, potential behaviours of decisions makers according to prospect theory are summarized in Table  1. Business factors can be considered with the objective of  maximization, and it is a mixed gamble problem. In such situations, both gain and loss are possible, and therefore, loss aversion causes extremely risk averse choices. Potential gains or losses can be related to financial conditions, cus-tomers, sales rates, market share and reputation of the firm. In business decisions, organizations tend to determine a  reference point. In this case, organization’s financial power, competitiveness and the reputation can be taken as a refer - ence point to make decisions. However, the marginal effect of loss in financial loss in  sales and loss in market share decreases over time, which coincides with the rule of diminishing sensitivity. Human and environmental safety are considered under  the objective of minimization. For human safety, job satis-faction and commitment of employees, overall productivity, labour productivity, compensation costs, fines and reputation of the organization could be the potential business losses. For environmental safety, potential losses may be consid-ered in terms of gas emission, carbon emission and loss of reputation. Depending on the location of the organization, the atti- tude of the government, level of enforcement, and rules and regulations may be of the determinants of reference points for both the human safety and the environmental safety. On the other hand, rule of diminishing sensitivity is not  applicable for human and environmental safety, as environ-ment and the losses affect the future generations’ well-being; therefore, it is not appropriate to claim that there is a dimin - ishing effect of losses. Framing and two selves effects fit well with prospect  theory. Further, the gambles are framed in terms of gains or losses. All three dimensions of our model are in line with framing and two selves effects. In Table  2, relationship  Table 1  Relationship between prospect theory aspects and sustain- ability dimensions Type Loss aversion Refer - ence  pointDimin-ishing sensitiv - ity Business factors Gain/loss ✓ ✓ ✓ Human safety Loss ✓ ✓ – Environmental  safetyLoss ✓ ✓ –  Y. Kazancoglu et al. 1 3 between dimensions of sustainability and framing and two  selves are presented. When business factors are analysed in line with the fram- ing effect, the reputation of the organization is emphasized and reputation may alter as a result of framing effect. For two selves, including experiencing and remembering, occur - rence time and severity influence the effects. Notably, the change in market share, decrease in productivity, financial losses and reputation problems can be given as examples of when two selves effect is applicable. The framing effect means that experts provided greater  importance to the human safety and the environmental safety to be used to change perceptions. For instance, related to human safety, even though the level of occupational acci - dents is low, working conditions may be harmful for employ - ees, causing potential chronic physical or mental problems. Additionally, environmental factors can also be framed easily. An example is focusing on improvements in emis-sions rate and presenting it to public, while disregarding the amount of solid waste generated. However, for two selves effect, if experts have past work  experiences about human and environmental safety, the remembering selves effect comes into prominence. There-fore, their decisions especially affected by peak-end rule and duration neglect. Thus, the relationship was revealed between the three  main principles of prospect theory and the three main dimen-sions of sustainability with a focus of e-waste recycling risk factors. Additionally, our models’ relationship with fram-ing and two selves effect, which are related concepts with prospect theory, are presented. With these explanations, an applicability of the integration of prospect theory and SRA in e-waste recycling is shown. Next, an appropriate technique is needed for SRA of  e-waste recycling. In risk assessment, there are many tech-niques for identification and evaluation; the most commons are as follows: brain storming, Delphi technique, checklist, preliminary hazard analysis, structured what-if technique, scenario analysis and business impact analysis. However in this study, focus is on risk evaluation techniques, and some of these are: hazard and operability , toxic-ity assessment, failure modes and effects analysis  , failure modes and effects and criticality analysis , cause and effect analysis, fault tree analysis, human reliability assessment, event tree analysis , cause-consequence analysis, root cause analysis, layers of protection analysis and decision tree analysis. Moreover, multicriteria decision analysis , risk indices and consequence/probability matrix are other techniques used in risk assessment . Bovea and Pérez-Belis  categorized methods for  evaluating environmental aspects under qualitative tech-niques, semi-qualitative techniques and quantitative tech-niques. Qualitative techniques include checklists, ten golden rules, materials, energy, toxic emissions  matrix and matrix element checklist. Semi-qualitative techniques include environmental product life cycle matrix environmen - tally responsible product/process assessment matrix, eco-design checklist method and product investigation, learning and optimization tool . Finally, for quantitative tech-niques different types of life cycle assessments were given such as Markov models, Monte Carlo methods, qualitative uncertainty analysis, statistical models, component failure and initiating event models . For environmental risk assessment, FMEA is one of the  most widely used techniques. Zeng et al.  integrated environmental and quality risks of project management using the FMEA method, Hu et al.  integrated FMEA and fuzzy AHP for the risk evaluation of green component to hazardous substance. Sherwood and Shu  used modi-fied FMEA to support design for remanufacture in terms of waste stream analysis. To sum up, to create SRA, the risk identification and risk  analysis based on sustainability dimensions were conducted in e-waste recycling. To account for irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers under risky and uncertain envi-ronment, the prospect theory is proposed. From this point of view, for risk evaluation the prospect theory-based TODIM method is recommended, which is explained in the follow - ing part. TODIM method The TODIM is a prospect theory-based discrete multicri - teria method . The word TODIM is a Portuguese acronym in for interactive and multicriteria decision-making . Unlike most of the multicriteria methods, which assume that decision mak - ers seek the maximum global measure value for the cor - responding solution, TODIM utilizes global measurement of value calculated by the application of prospect theory . From this point of view, the main rea-son to use TODIM in this study is, it focuses on the way of people make decision under risky conditions and accepts the philosophy of prospect theory.Table 2  Relationship between framing-two selves and sustainability  dimensions Framing Two selves Business factors ✓ ✓ Human safety ✓ ✓ Environmental safety ✓ ✓ Risk assessment for sustainability in e -waste recycling in circular economy   1 3 As a prospect theory-based method, TODIM gives the  shape the value function similar to gains/losses function of  cumulative prospect theory as shown in Fig.  1, where gains  and losses are always recognized concerning a reference point . The TODIM method is useful since it utilizes verbal scale  in the evaluation hierarchy of criteria, relationship between alternatives, and fuzzy judgements . TODIM is a beneficial method for behavioural decision- making. The main benefit of the TODIM is to define the relative degree of dominance for each alternative using pros-pect theory-based utility function . The TODIM method can be used for both the quantita- tive and the qualitative criteria, since the linguistic scales of the qualitative criteria can be transformed to cardinal ones, and both scales are normalized. Pairwise comparison is used in TODIM to measure dominance of alternatives over each other, and in the calculation part relative gain/loss values of alternatives are summed for each criterion . A decision matrix that involves alternatives and criteria  should be defined as shown in Table  3. The normalization  of matrix is further conducted. In Table  4, A 1, A2, …, Am are m  alternatives, C1, C2, …,  Cn are n  criteria, Pij is the rating of the alternative Ai regard - ing criterion Cj, and ω  =  T is the weight vec - tor related to the set of criteria C  = {C1, C2, …, Cn}, which  satisfies the following conditions ωj ∈  and ∑n j=1/u1D714j = 1. Formulation of the TODIM method is summarized from  the studies of Gomes et al.  and Qin et al.  as following;Step 1  Relative weight ω ir of the criterion Cj to the ref - erence criterion Cr is calculated as following: where ωj indicates the weight of the criterion Cj and  ωr= max{ωj}. Different methods such as analytical hierarchy process   or entropy can be integrated in this step for cal-culating weights for criteria. In this study, AHP is used. Step 2 Dominance degree of each alternative A i over  each alternative Ak regarding to criterion Cj are calculated  using Eq. . while θ is named as the attenuation factor of the losses. A  variety of θ  lead to different shapes of the prospect theo- retical value function in the negative quadrant. The range of the values of this parameter is θ  > 0, if 0 < θ  < 1, then the  effect of loss will increase; if θ  > 1, then the effect of loss  will decrease. /u1D714jr=/u1D714j∕/u1D714r  𝛷c=⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪⎩� Wjk ∑m j=1wjkifPij−Pkj>0 0 ifPij−Pkj=0 −1 𝜃��∑m j=1wjk�  wjkifPij−Pkj<0 Fig. 1  Value function of the TODIM methodTable 3  Matrix of normalized alternatives’ scores against criteria Alternatives Criteria C1 C2 … Cn A1 P11 P12 … P1n A2 P21 P22 … P2n … … … … … Am Pm1 Pm2 … Pmn Table 4  Specifications for computer disassembly tasks Task Definition of the removed com- ponentCom-ponent demand 1 Top cover 300 2 Optic disc 550 3 Floppy disc 250 4 Storage unit 800 5 Back plate 400 6 PCI cards 500 7 RAM modules  900 8 Power supply 350 9 Mother board 700  Y. Kazancoglu et al. 1 3 Step 3 Calculation of the overall dominance degree of  each alternative Ai over Ak regarding to criterion Cj as shown  below: Step 4  Further, the global prospect value of the alternative  Ai  is calculated: Step 5 In the final step, all alternatives are ranked according  to their global prospect values.

Case study Advanced technological developments lead to increase in purchasing rates of electronic devices, including mobile phones and computers; therefore, reuse activities, including collection and recycle, is increasing vital in today’s market place . Currently, e-waste is one of the priorities in waste management practices, and thus, decreas - ing the environmental effects of product from design phase to its end of life has become very important  /u1D6FF=n/uni2211.s1 j=1/u1D6F7j  /u1D709i=∑m k=1/u1D6FF−min∑m k=1/u1D6FF max∑m k=1/u1D6FF−min∑m k=1/u1D6FF.Osibanjo 2008). Potential risks of e-waste should be consid- ered while designing disassembly line due to its hazardous effects for human safety and environment. Therefore, disas-semble is one of the important stages that should be included into SRA in e-waste recycling. From this point of view, this study is narrowed down to a disassembly problem as a part of SRA in e-waste recycling, where disassembly risks are considered for SRA. This study involved a numerical example, a computer dis- assembly problem, formulated by Ilgin and Gupta . The aim of the problem is to find the optimal sequence of the computer disassembly tasks. The information about the problem is given in Table  4. As mentioned earlier, there are different types of risks in  e-waste recycling processes. However, since the computer disassembly is taken as a numerical example, so it is impor - tant to specify the risks based on the problem for SRA. For this, a focus group discussion has been conducted with six experts including three from e-waste recycling company, two computer engineers and one chemical engineer. As a result, following risks are selected for this study to evaluate each part of the computer and used as criteria for TODIM implementation and shown in Table  5. These given risks are used to evaluate tasks of computer  disassembly processes and to prioritize tasks by considering risk factors. Briefly, these risks are used for the SRA and specified for the computer disassemble problem.

Risk assessment for sustainability in e -waste recycling in circular economy   1 3 Results Explained totally, twelve risk factors were used as crite- ria and parts of the computer were used as alternatives. Microsoft Excel is used for the solution of problem via TODIM. Criteria 1–4 are business factors, criteria 5–8 are human safety risk factors, and criteria 9–12 are environ-mental risk factors. These criteria are presented in Table  5. The part of the computer which are disassembled is the  alternatives for TODIM and named as A1—Top Cover, A2—Optic Disk, A3—Floppy Disk, A4—Storage Unit, A5—Back Plate, A6—PCI Cards, A7—RAM Modules, A8—Power Supply, A9—Motherboard. Numerical example of this study was developed by Ilgin  and Gupta . Thus, values of part demand were taken from their example. Rest of the risk factors were evalu-ated by expert’s inputs in group decision-making. Since higher risk causes higher priority in disassembly tasks, in the scale, 5 means highest risk and 1 means lowest risk for evaluation. Evaluation of alternatives against criteria is given in  Table  6. The AHP method was hired to calculate weights and  was applied separately for business, human safety and environmental dimensions as a part of SRA. Same, six experts, who participated to the risk evaluation, are par - ticipated to the AHP implementation and asked to evalu-ate criteria. Weights of main criteria were found same, and rest of the weights of each criterion are presented in Table  7. A sensitivity analysis is needed to verify the stability of  the results, which can be done by varying values of attenu-ation factor of losses . With this view, sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the value of attenuation factor of losses ,  aiming to determine whether or not it has an effect on the order or not. Due to alterations in risk attitudes, it has been thought that the result may vary for different attenu-ation factors. In doing so, Θ  = 1, Θ = 2, Θ = 3, Θ = 4 and Θ = 5 are used, respectively, for the sensitivity analysis  and shown in Table  8. From Table  7, the changes in attenuation factors have no  significant effects on the prioritization of the tasks, which reveals the overwhelming dominance of certain alternatives over others. Further, RAM modules, motherboard and power supply received the high priority in terms of risk assess-ment. The floppy disc needs less attention, according to the numerical results. However, it should be remembered that criteria selection can alter and depend on the product and it affects the numerical results. Therefore, implementation of the suggested methodology may give different numerical results, according to the needs of the organization. Discussion and managerial implications Due to decreased product life cycles and improvements in technological developments, e-waste is a rapid growing waste stream and one of the significant threats on circular economy . Increasing concerns about environment reveal the importance of the end-of-life phase  Table 6  Evaluation of  alternatives against criteriaC1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10 C11 C12 A1 3 300 2 2 4 4 2 4 1 5 2 1 A2 2 550 2 4 2 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 A3 1 250 1 3 2 2 1 1 2 4 1 3 A4 5 800 3 5 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 4 A5 2 400 2 2 4 4 1 1 1 5 2 1 A6 4 500 4 5 3 3 1 1 1 4 1 4 A7 5 900 4 5 3 3 1 1 3 5 1 2 A8 3 350 3 4 3 4 1 3 4 4 1 5 A9 4 700 5 5 2 2 1 1 3 5 1 4Table 7  Criteria weights Main criteria weights Criteria Criteria weights 0.33 C1 0.135 C2 0.049 C3 0.097 C4 0.052 0.33 C5 0.031 C6 0.194 C7 0.080 C8 0.028 0.33 C9 0.056 C10 0.181 C11 0.017 C12 0.081  Y. Kazancoglu et al. 1 3 of products and the activities of reuse, remanufacturing, dis- assembly and recycling. The SRA requires integrating the risks related to human,  environment and business . The  SRA not only seeks to consider the organizations’ finan-cial performance, but also aims to maintain the longer and broader survival of the company . There-fore, risks to be evaluated under SRA can act both indepen-dently and dependently. The dependent behaviour of these risks is caused by the interrelated aspects. Thus, the assess-ment of these risks should consider the interdependency. As asserted by the study of Asante et al. , systematic approach is essential to deal with the risks of e-waste, and hence this study is based on systems approach to embrace both three dimensions of sustainability and different types of risks inherent in the e-waste recycling. Thus, the SRA and the proposed methodology are the reflection of system approach. This study integrates SRA and prospect theory to con- sider irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers within the risky and uncertain nature of e-waste recycling. Furthermore, this study contributes the literature by integrat-ing sustainability and risk concepts in e-waste recycling, where a gap in the literature related to combinatory dis-cussions in these subjects is stated by Rafi-Ul-Shan et al. . From the managerial viewpoints, e-waste recycling is  an economically promising sector and it directly affects the circular economy. However, inherent potential risks should be considered by organizations to achieve sustainability by preventing environmental, human and business losses. Appropriate resource allocation is needed for risk preven-tion in a risk management process . These resources include labour, finance, machinery and equipment. Organizations should allocate their resources considering the different risks. Considering environmental and human safety widens the number and scope of these risks. Hence, the proposed study can contribute to the planning and organ-izing activities of managers in a holistic manner. The pro-posed risk-based task prioritization process further enables effective resource allocation. In addition, organizations need to consider bottlenecks in resource allocation while prior - itizing tasks in e-waste recycling. The proposed work can easily be applied on various different tasks in a wide range of industries dealing with e-waste and recycling. Further - more, considering human risk attitudes during the e-waste recycling activities would be beneficial for organizations in terms of reducing potential effects on society. In addition, it is apparent that the managers cannot  achieve a sustainable growth and continuous improvement without conducting risk management. The risk assessment is an important part of risk management, and it should not only be applied at the strategic level but also needed at tac-tical and operational levels. Thus, the deployment and dis-semination of the risk assessment are essential for long term success, sustainability and circular economy. Therefore, the proposed model in this study will support and equip manag-ers aiming to integrate risk management and human decision process with an ultimate aim of achieving sustainability in e-waste recycling. Conclusion E-waste becomes a global problem, which threats the sus - tainability and circular economy. The focus of this study is evaluating the risks of e-waste recycling and developing a decision tool under uncertain and risky conditions. SRA is adopted as a tool to categorize risks of e-waste recycling, and decision-making attitudes of human is taken into the centre of the research question of this study, which is “How shall we incorporate decision making under risk and irra-tionality within sustainability risk assessment for e-waste recycling?”. In order to achieve the purpose of this work, Table 8  Results for the each  attenuation factorΘ = 1 Θ = 2 Θ = 3 Θ = 4 Θ = 5 ALT Normal  global valueALT Normal global valueALT Normal global valueALT Normal global valueALT Normal global value A 7 1.000 A7 1.000 A7 1.000 A7 1.000 A7 1.000 A9 0.907 A9 0.906 A8 0.910 A9 0.913 A8 0.917 A8 0.901 A8 0.904 A9 0.903 A8 0.901 A9 0.900 A6 0.778 A6 0.766 A6 0.755 A6 0.746 A6 0.738 A1 0.610 A1 0.630 A1 0.648 A1 0.663 A1 0.677 A4 0.474 A4 0.477 A4 0.479 A4 0.480 A4 0.482 A2 0.460 A2 0.461 A2 0.462 A2 0.462 A2 0.463 A5 0.413 A5 0.415 A5 0.417 A5 0.418 A5 0.420 A3 0.000 A3 0.000 A3 0.000 A3 0.000 A3 0.000 Risk assessment for sustainability in e -waste recycling in circular economy   1 3 the prospect theory and its aspects are integrated to the SRA  for e-waste recycling, and prospect theory-based TODIM method is used for a computer disassembly problem as a case study. In this work, the tasks of computer disassembly processes are prioritized considering risk factors. The results showed that, while RAM modules, motherboard and power supply received the high priority in terms of risk assess-ment, the floppy disc needs less attention. From a manage-rial context, it is revealed that integration of prospect theory with SRA is applicable for fulfilling the gap in knowledge related to considering irrationality and risk attitudes of deci-sion makers within the risky and uncertain nature of e-waste recycling. Among limitations, this study can handle the ambigui- ties and vagueness in the problem, but the results are not generalizable. Another limitation is that the proposed work has been applied in e-waste recycling. Further, in order to increase the effectiveness of the pro- posed methodology the continuous monitoring of risks is needed and risk evaluation may be adjusted further. Organi - zational culture, strategic priorities and vision of the com-pany, the demographic, social and educational background of the experts may alter the outcomes of this work, which appears as another limitation. Future studies could apply the proposed methodology  for other sectors and implement the suggested methodol - ogy on other real-life problems. Comparative analysis can be also conducted among different companies, sectors and even countries. Further, the scope of the proposed method can also be extended by covering circular operations other than recycling.
