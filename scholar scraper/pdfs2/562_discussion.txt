A critical consideration of legislative interest is the evaluation of environmental haz-
ards associated with the REE industry and the EU’s existing environmental and radiation
protection. To this end legislation and best practice documentation should be anticipated
and a comparison of key regulative aspects among selected countries with existing REE
mining industries can be deployed (Keith-Roach et al. 2015).
However, the aforementioned best practice documentation can be considered in align-
ment with the companies’ size and the time span of implementation. Indeed, while the
applicable processes can be proven appropriate for all business types, the time span re-
quired for realization varies signiﬁcantly. In particular, large companies tend to suffer
from bureaucratic structures, whereas small and micro sized companies are commonly
lacking knowledge and resources available (Miehe et al. 2015). In practice, the aforemen-
tioned lengthy and complex legislative constraints could be treated by the development of
database architectures, which can take into consideration the minimal technical require-
ments, access and display of records, as well as searching and administrating facilities
offered (Macovescu and Guta 2012).
Actually, the foundation of relevant industry-centered legislation for, ﬁrst, industrial
health and safety and, second, environmental orientation, should be convergent with the
ongoing technological progress, workforce protection, and local societies’ acceptability.
To this end shortcomings in legislation should be treated in a proactive way, being un-
