In the extensive literature on various proecological behavior issues, we can highlight
several articles that consider various factors and barriers that affect environmental respon-
sibility, which implies a more efﬁcient use of natural resources. Thus, the article [ 27,49]
noted that in addition to environmental awareness, the availability of ﬁnancial resources,
time, and opportunities affect the desire to purchase environmental goods. Studies [ 50–52]
demonstrate that time preferences inﬂuence the valuation of PEBs even in very different
cultural contexts (US and India), and people who have free time are more engaged in
energy-saving proenvironmental behavior. Unlike previous research, our study did not
reveal the differences in the frequency of some PEBs between the groups of economically ac-
tive and inactive respondents, which can support our original hypothesis that having more
free time in the absence of a permanent job can contribute to more careful handling of all
resources and the use of more labor-intensive waste management practices. The exception
is the pattern P8 “turning off lights in empty rooms”.
On the contrary, economically active respondents demonstrate greater environmental
awareness. In a study [ 37] on the example of European countries, the author showed
evidence of a positive inﬂuence of education on the proecological behavior of individuals.
The same kind of positive correlation was recently found in [ 53] on the example of Peru for
the PEBs, connected with plastic consumption. Our results also showed that involvement in
the educational process has a positive effect on the respondent’s values and attitude towards
