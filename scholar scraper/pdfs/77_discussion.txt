Packaging waste management is a complex issue in an y setting. However, packaging waste 
management in low institutionalized countries, such  as emerging economies, is even more 
complex due to the institutional voids that are pre sent.  Notwithstanding this, some countries, 
such as India, have in place laws and regulation th at require and push the agenda for a CE on 
packaging. A case in point is the SWM (2016) law in  India as previously mentioned. 
With this research we start to uncover the black bo x that brands created around the 
divorce between products and packaging. Brands, and  particularly large MNEs of fast-
moving consumer goods, need to rethink the way they  look at their product as consumers will 
more and more follow an integrative approach where packaging is part of the product.  This 
approach is also in the government’s and individual ’s interest. 
However, and due to the resource constraints and ot her limitations, the enforceability 
of such regulations is not effective, leaving brand s to operate on a linear economy (Ferreira et 
al., 2014; Huysman et al., 2017).  However, and hav ing in mind the stakeholders theory and a 
CE approach, combined with some of the features off ered by some emerging technologies, 
we believe that the right systems with the right in centives can help in alleviating the situation
