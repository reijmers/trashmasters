Nonhousehold enduse plastics the forgotten plastics for the circular economy Kerstin Kleinhans Ruben Demets Jo Dewulf Kim Ragaertand Steven De Meester It is commonly agreed in the current legislative and scientic discourse that plastics recycling rates should be increased Many recycling studies are dedicated towards this but often they focus on posthousehold plastic waste Nonhousehold enduse plastics seems to be forgotten in data gathering policy making and research but have promising potential for high quality recycling In this manuscript we bring together the most recent existing literature on nonhousehold enduse plastic waste and offer a framework for shifting future waste management plans to effectively help increasing recycling rates Addresses Laboratory for Circular

Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd This is an open access article under the CC BYNCND license  commonsorglicensesbyncnd Introduction Currently the global average plastic recycling rate is below C This low plastic recycling rate is widely addressed and targeted for example in European policy or the US Plastics Pact Increasing plastic recycling rates is important to become a sustainable and resource efcient society as plastics released in the environment cause environmental problems and the traditional pro duction of plastics is dependent on our fossil fuel reserves The focus of policy guidelines as well as researchoften lies on postconsumer packaging waste as it is the largest plastic waste stream In this the terminol ogy of consumption means household consumption whereas the ISO denition of postconsumer in fact relates to all activities where waste is disposed by an enduser including endusers that are for example com panies industrial waste or shops commercial waste Postconsumer waste of industrial or commercial origins is quite diverse in type composition and level of contami nation depending strongly on its disposing entity How ever this waste is signicantly different from household waste Some examples include exible lm that is used as secondary packaging be it around pallets or for individual items like in clothing shops EPS for packaging purposes and rigid plastics from temporary products like displays or crates Pots tubes and trays PTTs crates canisters barrels Quantities and recycling rates for these specic plastic waste streams are typically poorly reported in scientic and grey literature if reported at all The goal of this manuscript is therefore twofold rstly to address the often confusing terminology regarding types of plastic waste and secondly to review the most recent studies that address quantities composition collection and recycling potential of nonhousehold enduse plastic waste Additionally we discuss the bottlenecks and opportunities for this type of plastic waste to contribute to a circular economy for plastics Terminology The rst issue is that the terminology and commonly used denitions do not specically address nonhousehold enduse plastics ISO distinguishes pre and postconsumer material Preconsumer material often referred to as postindustrial waste is dened as material diverted from the waste stream during a manufacturing process Excluded is reutilization of mate rials such as rework regrind or scrap generated in a process and capable of being reclaimed within the same process that generated it The same ISO norm denes postconsumer material as waste generated by endusers such as commercial industrial and institutional facilities next to households This denition is commonly used for example in Eurostat or EPA databases In parallel the term municipal waste is used to address wastes collected by municipalities no matter the origin eg household commercial institutional Available online at wwwsciencedirectcom ScienceDirect wwwsciencedirectcom Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering The common terms postconsumer waste and municipal waste are thus a group term for both house hold and nonhousehold waste An overview of commonly used terminology can be found in Figure When looking deeper into these types of waste we can see that they are inherently different Plastic waste from households often comprises a complex material mix that is prone to contaminations as it contains typical products bought for example in supermarkets as PET Bottles PET trays PE bottles PP bottles and trays lms such as food wraps and so on On the other hand when the end user is a business industry or institution typical plastic waste products are secondary packaging that might be eligible for high end recycling on their own but might not end up in a suitable recycling scheme Looking to thedifference in typology of waste it can be questioned if they should fall within the same terminological classi cation being postconsumer Another commonly used terminology is commercial and industrial CI waste This might cause confusion as preconsumer waste is also referred to as postindustrial waste which also includes industrial scraps of high purity In this sense there is a distinction between industry that produces and industry that consumes Following a standardized classication for economic activities for example the European NACE codes  europaeucompetitionmer gerscasesindexnaceall html plastic producing sectors include amongst others Manufacture of plastics in primary forms and Manufacture of plastic

LDPE wrapping lm that serves as packaging of car parts in a car manufacturing company and is disposed there is not postindustrial waste but should be more clearly classied separately Therefore we propose to consistently differentiate between the terminology nonhousehold enduse plastics and household enduse plastics Note that in this proposed terminology the term consumption is also replaced by enduse as this seems more suited to capture what happens to plastic as consumption might be more suited for applications such as food Quantities To our knowledge there is hardly any scientic study with a systematic focus on solely nonhousehold enduse plastics and its potential for the circular economy The few studies on this topic focus on mixed commercial and industrial waste including but not limited to plastics Table gives an overview on the studies available on non household plastic waste typically performed with a specic regional focus Already in it was pointed out that literature with nonhousehold type waste in general is scarce Sev eral other authors conrm that this waste streams are notwell recorded in the EU and that detailed global data are missing CC This is said very aptly by De Weerdt et al in a study focusing on the effect of waste incineration taxation by noticing the asymmetry between the limited studies compared to its amounts of waste generation calling it even paradoxical This lack of data hinders policy makers to set clear target and recognition of opportunities C Those presented studies Table give a rst glimpse on the quantities of nonhousehold enduse plastic waste produced but it remains hard to deduct numbers with great condence The scarce data sources indicate that nonhousehold type waste streams when collected comingled with other materials have a plastic content of approximately Following the assumption that nonhousehold enduse plastic waste mainly consist of secondary packaging it allows the estimation based on the study of Hestin et

Belgian study  wwwvalipacbenlwaarbel andtonsbedrijfsmatig plasticverpakkingsafvaluiteindelijk that more than of nonhousehold plastic waste is exported outside of the EU WRAP conrms this and gives an indication that the amounts estimated could be even higher than Exported plastic waste and landlling can be identied as one of the main pathways that release plastics towards the environment for example as ocean debris Composition The recycling potential for plastics is among others dependent on the polymer types and contamination levels present in the waste stream Diving deeper into compositional data of nonhousehold enduse waste big varieties can be noted in the share of plastic explained by the diversity of types and size of thebusinesses CC Hestin et al C report specically a share of lm bottles and asks and of Pots Tubes and Trays PPTs in European commercial and industrial plastic packaging waste see Table Dehne et al conrms that lm and rigid plastic are the biggest types in municipal commercial waste A study from the United Nations Environment Programm reports that nonhousehold enduse plastics mainly comprises PE PP PS and PVC This can be con rmed by other authors and the fact that these polymers make part of the biggest types of polymers produced CC Hestin et al C provides information on the share of polymer type per type that can be found in Table Next to that Table gives data on the share of polymer type in CI waste in Australia C Collection The collection rate of commercial and industrial plastic packaging waste in the EU is stated to be C Collection costs of nonhousehold waste are signicantly lower compared to posthousehold waste as there are more consistent and the amounts are generally large According to ongoing research and expert judg ment from recyclers and collectors it can be stated that signicant amounts of nonhousehold plastic waste still end up in the residual bin especially from small and mediumsized enterprises SMEs Companies state that they either do not know other collection systems think their waste amounts are insignicant or think that it is more convenient than a source separated collection In comparison to posthousehold waste the collection is often done by private operators instead of being organized by the local municipalities Plastic waste from the com mercial sector and SMEs in contrast might also be collected via a municipal collector but often as part of a mixed residual waste fraction Furthermore they Frontiers energy environment and sustainability plastics in the environment Table Share of

wwwsciencedirectcomare not always prone for the extended producer responsi bility EPR schemes C Both these points have as consequence that data on these fractions is not systemat ically monitored per region and producing sector C Potential for the circular economy Studies on the recycling potential of nonhousehold end use type materials are likewise scarce Whole frac tions of mixed commercial waste like plastics could in fact be recyclable but due to technical issues eg disassem bling of composites or contamination this is not econom ically feasible Therefore it is commonly used as solid recovered fuel SRF thanks to high caloric value and low water content To our knowledge there are no studies yet on the recycling potential merely focusing on nonhousehold enduse plastics Some sources state that this waste tends to be of higher quality compared to household plastic waste CC According to the authors experience this valuable material is often downgraded by mixed collec tion which signicantly contaminates the cleaner plas tics turning recyclable plastics into residual waste Analyzing the studies discussed in Sections Quantities and Composition gives a glimpse on the quantities of nonhousehold enduse plastic which can give a rst estimation on their potential contribution to the circular economy Knowing that total postconsumer plastic waste generated in the EU NOCH is M ta or M ta in the EU the quantities estimated in Section Quantities M ta shows that the non household plastic waste is expected to contribute some where between of the recycling rate of the EU and it thus has a big potential to reach the ambitions plastic recycling targets of the EU and beyond These numbers have a focus on the EU but it is expected to be in the same order of magnitude for other areas such as the USA or Southeast Asian data for plastic content in MSW for example to be found in Refs or Discussion Based on the above ndings we introduce the term forgotten plastics for nonhousehold enduse plastic Generally industrial actors and some policy makers are well aware that these waste streams exist yet these potentially highly recyclable plastics typically disappear in the overall waste statistics and consequently policies and scientic research does not address it separately also caused by the lack of data Literature indicates that in terms of quantity and quality they could signicantly contribute to the circular economy for plastics To give nonhousehold enduse plastic waste a chance to become part of a circular economy the lack of data and the related of lack of attention that has been lasting for a few decades has to end We therefore propose astrategy to mitigate the current status quo of recycling nonhousehold enduse plastic waste which is depicted in Figure First a clear terminology has to be introduced that allows setting the right focus on data collection research and policymaking We propose to systematically subdivide the ISO denition of postconsumer waste into household and nonhousehold material and thereby acknowledging the difference in origin composition and recycling potential Secondly to mitigate arguments on the economic feasi bility of recycling these nonhousehold fraction a struc tural collection of data on quantities and qualities has to be done based on the terminology as described above Thereby it is crucial to analyze different sectorsNonhousehold enduse plastics forgotten plastics Kleinhans et al Figure Und erstand ing the status qu o by structural coll ecti on of data of waste generati on and compositi ons per

Opinion in Chemical Engineering Flowchart suggestion to bring focus on nonhousehold enduse plastics in the future Blue arrows indicate codependencies wwwsciencedirectcom Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering separately by for example using a NACE classication Gathering data on this type of waste will be a challenge as a statistically relevant number of business should be analyzed preferably per NACE code to gain insight in the diversity of this type of waste Furthermore there is also a diversity within each NACE code related to for example company size Data should thus preferably be analyzed per NACE codes and expressed as waste per employee or per turnover CC Data on composition up to polymer level is lacking as well despite this being crucial information for highend recycling solutions Thirdly based on this data tailored waste management solutions that nd an optimal tradeoff between collecting sufcient tonnages to be economically feasible but also providing highest qualities possible should be introduced Some streams might be sufciently clean to reprocess as such whereas others need to be kept separate Based on the experience of the author team we tend to believe that it will be difcult to achieve the same qualities when performing postseparation instead of source separation even with stateoftheart technology We encourage putting future research focus on this Extended studies on lumping strategies of different kind of substreams eg per sector per polymer type per contamination level of nonhousehold enduse plastics to optimize the tradeoff between quality and quantity are needed In this sense lumping can be dened as the investigation on which plastic waste streams can be mixed or absolutely need to be excluded during collection and recycling to ensure best recycling quality possible This can depend amongst others on polymer types contamination level and quantities Further we are convinced that especially urban areas have a big potential for developing tailored collection solutions due to the high density of business activities Moreover innovative and sustainable collections solu tions for example reverse logistics electronic vehicles or transport bicycles should be investigated Also introduc ing EPR schemes specically for nonhousehold enduse could provide more pronounced nancial incentives C This steps can be the starting point to also nd linkages between industries like recommended by Chertow et al to create circular business cases To reach this studies like Bremner et al or Patricio et al for multiple business sectors with focus on plastic waste should be conducted CCC The purpose of a circular economy for plastics and thus for circular business models is to maintain products and materials in the loop through several valuepreserving cycles such as repair reuse remanufac turing and recycling This can be done by tailoring business models and product design amongst others but since plastics often move fast through the value chain it might be important to apply for example quadruple helix approaches to reach a broader group of stakeholders LudekeFreund give a comprehensive review on existing circular business models in literature and conclude that six major patterns for circular business models are repair and maintenance reuse and redistribution refurbishment and remanufacturing recycling cascading and repurpos ing and organic feedstock business models Accent ure strategy identies the following ve circular business models as most promising resource recovery productservice systems productlife extensions sharing platforms and circular value chains Especially the latter circular value chains can be promising as local business cases for nonhousehold plastic waste for exam ple in forms of a local plastic hub with product makers and waste owners that share the positive and negative value of the circular plastics All this is not possible without behavior change of businesses and business cases Being open for setting up a recycling system for plastics in business using more materials with recycled content or using recyclate in ones own production needs engaged decision makers in the businesses A recent study by Khan et al analyzed the barriers and drivers towards recycling in several businesses They conclude that there is an intentionbehavior gap businesses have posi tive intentions towards best practices in plastics recycling but seem to fail to implement these They recommend that governments have to offer incentives disseminating knowledge and creating networking platforms for collab oration among decision makers to overcome this Conclusions Because of the lack of clear terminology and the com monly used division in preconsumer and postconsumer waste enduse plastic waste from nonhousehold origin is not sufciently addressed in policy making data gather ing nor in research despite its high potential for recycling Therefore we address them as the forgotten plastics of the circular economy and introduce the term nonhouse hold enduse plastic The limited number of current studies on quantities of nonhousehold waste like streams indicate to have a plastic content of around We estimate a range of C kta of nonhousehold enduse plastic waste in the EU but this is prone to high variations as it depends on the number type and sizes of businesses Nonhousehold plastics can thus probably contribute by to recycling rate targets and thus play an essential role in the circular economy Nevertheless overall data availability is poor CC This holds also for compositional analyses Only a few studies show that the main polymers in nonhousehold enduse plastic are of PE PP PS and PVC and the biggest waste type is lm material according to Ref C yet from a different typology compared to household plastic waste Nonhousehold enduse plastic from SMEs are often collected as a mixed waste fraction and which Frontiers energy environment and sustainability plastics in the environment Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering wwwsciencedirectcomdecreases its potential for qualitative recycling as the separate waste stream would usually contain less contam ination compared to household waste Nonhousehold enduse plastic streams can play an important role to increase overall plastic recycling rates To do so it has to be brought into the picture of policy makers statistical institutes and research by introducing clear terminology structural data gathering tailored waste management solutions and the creation of circular business cases Moreover general behavior changes of business play a roll into all these points This review hopes to have sufciently highlighted these forgotten plastics as a subject for further research and policy making Conict of
