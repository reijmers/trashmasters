nivanovapgupsru Abstract This article is about regional development based on the principles of circular economy and the industrial symbiosis framework Nowadays tremendous amount of solid waste from household industrial and agricultural materials accumulate in the territories of different countries around whole world Finland has experience in waste techno parks design and in the development of waste branch around the whole country Finland has considered be one of the leading country in Circular Economy and its government strategic goal is to be the leading country in the world in Circular Economy until The Finnish experience shows that there has to be close cooperation between companies universities and authorities but also common goal and understanding The main questions which are the elements that could be adapted from the Finnish Circular Economy and the resource efficiency thinking and how to implement ideas into other cultural and industrial environments in Russia Our researchers together could discuss and decide which are the key elements that can be used and which of them contradict to using industrial symbiosis development in Russia Introduction The World Economic Forum report has termed this period of accelerating innovation in science and technology the transformative change in data and technology capabilities combined with a merging of digital physical and biological realms and its consequences on society as the Fourth Industrial Revolution It is not only transforming social networks scientific research and whole industries it is also radically reshaping biological and material science innovations Harnessing these opportunities and proactively managing the risks manifest by the rapid evolution of new science and technologies will inevitably require more creativity and agility in current governance frameworks and financing arrangements A crucial role in market evolution is happening by exploring how businesses can use the circular economy to drive arbitrage opportunities across complex global supply chains A circular economy is restorative and regenerative by design and aims to keep products components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times It questions whether with creativity and innovation we can build a restorative economy To be successful on new challenges of Industry development enterpriseuniversity partnerships has to be intense and main objective should be a shared learning Longterm cooperation creates a background for new coinnovation and co evolution The technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution have generated enormous excitement about the opportunities they offer as well as concern about governance regulation and ethics Efficient waste treatment IOP Conf Series Earth and Environmental Science IOP Publishing doi There are as well exciting possibilities The convergence of new technologies is creating unprecedented opportunities in all aspects from businesstobusiness commerce to humanitarian intervention The melding of artificial intelligence AI with big data capabilities not to mention the actual exponential accumulation of data itself has created a fascinating world of communications collaboration and interaction not just between people but also between machines and between people and machines Through digital transformation the use of new technologies like big data open data cloud IoT platforms artificial intelligence and social networks with increasing intelligence and automation enterprises can capitalize on new opportunities and optimize existing operations to achieve significant business improvement Theoretical background The new approach is the revised legislative proposal on waste It covers longterm recycling targets for municipal and packaging waste measures to limit landfilling and incentives for Member States to use economic instruments at the national level It also aims to promote cooperation between industries with waste from one process becoming secondary materials for others through a simplified legal framework for byproducts and endofwaste status creating more certainty for operators in these markets That leads us for an opportunity to build value networks from the point of side flows of waste It leads to a business opportunity for industrial symbiosis The key notice on sustainability is what extent it will be impact to specific business sector and influences on creation of circular economy business and industrial symbiosis It is an industrychanging paradigm integrating innovation differentiation and transformation Tajani has started that there will be no sustainability without competitiveness and there will be no longlasting competitiveness without sustainability and there will be neither of them without a quantum leap in innovation Industry describes the organization of production processes based on technology and devices autonomously communicating with each other along the value chain Industry architecture takes account of the increased digitalization of various industries where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into the information network allowing for decentralized production and realtime adaptation in the future What is characteristics to Industry is that it involves connecting products to each other Industry is a closely linked to CyberPhysical Systems CPS and can be defined as transformative technologies which manage interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational capabilities To be successful on new challenges of Industry development enterpriseuniversity partnerships has to be intense and main objective should be a shared learning Longterm cooperation creates a background for new coinnovation and co evolution Adapting Industry framework as a basis for development activities has expected to provide an opportunity for remarkable competitive advantage for businesses but also for regions Nidumolu Prahalad and Rangaswami explain widely why sustainability is now the key driver of innovation The biggest benefit comes from generating and processing big data Information technology helps make large amounts of data available for different purposes in the public or private sector with minimum effort and costs Conradie Choenni have recognized that the most reliable method how to identify the datasets with big potential is a demandbased approach which means a close cooperation with potential end users Every participant in ecosystem has an opportunity to participate on creation of innovations and value which generally is produced on the boundaries of ecosystem stakeholders Business ecosystem can be born as group activity or a single company can create it by collaborative activities Research questions and research approach Nations are struggling with big global challenges like climate change lack of resources waste problems etc but nations and companies are also facing changes because of digitalization at the stage of the fourth industrial devolution The role of circular economy and digitalization as a business driver is growing in waste management and as digital symbiosis in industrial innovation platform The main research questions are a What are the future key factors to solve waste problem on a sustainable way Efficient waste treatment IOP Conf Series Earth and Environmental Science IOP Publishing doi b How to manage change towards circular economy from waste management c How to evaluate the profitability of circular economy development investment This article introduces a concept model for utilizing circular economy and digitalization as a business and innovation driver to facilitate the transition from waste management towards circular economy and digital symbiosis Circular economy framework The circular economy refers to an industrial economy that is restorative by intention aims to rely on renewable energy minimizes tracks and hopefully eliminates the use of toxic chemicals and eradicates waste through careful design The system diagram in figure illustrates the continuous flow of technical and biological materials through the value network The term goes beyond the mechanics of production and consumption of goods and services in the areas that it seeks to redefine examples include rebuilding capital including social and natural and the shift from consumer to user The concept of the circular economy is grounded in the study of non linear particularly living systems This ensures enhanced flows of goods and services Figure The circular economy an industrial system that is restorative by design New business via industrial symbiosis Changing economic structures intensifying environmental problems and increasing demandrelated requirements all mean that companies need to come up with more resourceintensive solutions These can be achieved through cooperation between companies operating in various sectors and alongside local authorities and municipalities Industrial symbiosis is an industrial ecosystem in which unused or residual resources of one company are used by another This results in mutual economic social and environmental benefits It is a process involving several companies firms that complement one another provide mutual added value through efficient use of raw materials technology services and energy Joint development of industrial symbiosis provides an efficient way of thinking up developing and testing product and service innovations This in turn engenders new competencies on which new business operations can utilize Business ecosystems based on industrial symbiosis provide more added value by using fewer natural resources than traditional industrial value chains This means more efficient energy and water consumption and reduced waste In industrial symbiosis industrial operations energy production primary production waste processing and the services supporting these combine to form an entity that provides products and services for enduser needs while optimizing resource use Challenges and opportunities in Russia st century is characterized as the first Urban Century in the history of humankind Efficient waste treatment IOP Conf Series Earth and Environmental Science IOP Publishing doi In Russia waste management was a challenge already in Soviet times but since the beginning of ies it has become one of the most critical economic and environmental problems in Russia For many years the Russian governments priorities focused on oil and gas defence and heavy industries while waste management was considered to be an issue for future generations and continuously neglected Russia has a legal and regulatory framework in the environmental area but responsibilities are distributed between many bodies that enforce and control the regulations poorly As a result environmental protection in general and waste management in particular is an increasing concern With recent changes in lifestyle increasing waste volumes to such high levels that current facilities and outdated technologies are insufficient the problem becomes definitely crucial Experts believe that poor environmental situation contribute to a also short life expectancy at birth in Russian Federation Figure There is huge potential to develop circular economy in Russia Anyhow comparison to western European development can be misleading because of size of country or the structure of industry or the consumer habits Eg in case of Finland all the waste is not collected and treated in a proper way because of long distances Figure Treatment of Household waste in European countries in year Circular Economy concept has also a very strong strategic approach for many countries Since some materials which are needed in hightech products are running short and availability from the ground is decreasing Therefore those strategic materials which are needed are mainly in the products which we use now In case of Finland circular economy is a part of Finnish innovation policy and Finland wants be the leading country in circular economy in the year Efficient waste treatment IOP Conf Series Earth and Environmental Science IOP Publishing doi Experiences coming from Finland show that joint development of industrial symbiosis provides an efficient way of thinking developing and testing product and service innovations This in turn engenders new competencies on which new business operations can be based The cooperation between government enterprise and universities is essential to succeed in co evolution when building up cumulative competence in creation of solutions for circular economy by benefiting digitalization in it It is also essential to have a common vision to direct the local operation and funding Otherwise the activities can splinter as small pieces and do not form parts of the whole vision In rapidly changing operational environment it a clear and commonly understood vision is required Forming triangle Industrial symbiosis digitalization and legislation On the above mentioned we can suppose that triangle consists of the industrial symbiosis digitalization and legislation This industrial symbiosis can involve stakeholders at all levels companies authorities of different levels and municipalities smart and digital technologies and legislation agencies and experts to develop a methodology and software platform to facilitate the exchange of information that can support industrial symbiosis networks create and support pilot projects and replicate their results at local and regional levels Such model has to be designed on the triangle presented on the Figure and considering Economical Environmental and social issues during whole companies lifecycle it can lead to use fewer natural resources and more benefit Applying these models can create new business and new challenges for companies and economy Figure Industrial symbiosis digitalization and legislation as forming triangle Towards the opportunities of new material sources Megacities are facing challenges in its waste management On the other hand megacities have not yet been active to take use the latest concepts in circular economy thinking Including this in the fast Industrial symbiosis digitalization and innovations New business New challengies legislation Environmental issue Economical issue Social issue Efficient waste treatment IOP Conf Series Earth and Environmental Science IOP Publishing doi development of digitalisation there will be new technical solutions in market which can provide new possibilities and business models Therefore there are new tools and concepts to build up the future approach and strategy to solve waste problem or in the other words take benefit to circulate material and use the waste for the materials of new products or turn into energy One proposed approach is to take full use of the concept of circular economy and learn the best practices from other countries Anyhow learning the best practices does not mean simply coping ideas from other countries and bringing copies In these cases we should see learning so that we are able to implement the best practices so that they fit into local environment and traditions In this case the approach will be related to circular economy and digitalisation there will be need for large and longlasting cooperation between government universities and enterprises to be able to manage the change Anyhow this change has to be seen so that it creates huge amount new innovation and buildup new business models and business The expenses of circular economy development should not be calculated in short turn business profit basis but it should be seen as long term strategic investment which will bring long term benefits to different sectors of society Discussion and Conclusions Circular economy and industrial symbiosis should not be seen only the way to solve the waste management problem but it can also be seen as the part of social and economic development The change towards circular economy takes time and it needs actions from different sectors universities government and private sector Digital ecosystems and industrial symbiosis should be seen as continuous developing entirety which will change and renew themselves thus maintaining their competiveness Digitalization circular economy and industrial symbiosis are the key drivers which will change the business environments a way to act and create innovation Innovations will need real life transdisciplinary piloting environments Both resource efficiency and digitalization are directing towards service business and environments The expenses of circular economy development should not be calculated in short turn business profit basis but circular economy development should be seen as long term strategic investment which will bring long term benefits to different sectors of society
