accepted december published december gidgidgidgidgidgidgidgidgid gid gidgidgidgidgidgidgid abstract cotonou is the largest city and main economic centre of the nation of benin africa following independence the city has experienced major population growth resulting in the extensive development of slums on ood plains and marshes causing the loss of biodiversity of these fragile ecosystems infrastructural development unable to keep pace with informal settlement development and a cumbersome municipal service system have led to the illegal dumping of organic and plastic wastes and extensive land pollution in addition due to its primary dune coastal location cotonou is facing sea level rise risks demonstrating the urgent need to sustainably address urban development through a sociotechnical framework this paper considers the use of transformed plastic wastes as new settlement building blocks to reduce solid waste create jobs and develop lowcost housing this new strategy offers employment empowerment and a strategy to generate an income of us per annum and the creation of permanent jobs keywords cotonou plastic waste housing job creation circular economy sustainability environmental technologies introduction cities currently comprise of land area on earth but boast a total human population of according to the global activity report this population number is expected to soar up towards of the earths total human population by while cities are hailed as nodes for commerce culture science productivity social human and economic development addressing issues of quality urban planning transport systems water energy and waste management are city policy priorities lagging behind these nodal subaspirations and the host city infrastructure is constantly in need of upgrading to accommodate these priorities within this context addressing waste management has been pointed to as a key indicator of the success of environmental sustainability efforts in a city urbanisation coupled with population increase and economic growth has resulted in an enormous increase in the number volume and mass of all kinds of wastes including hazardous and nonhazardous garbage biological and clean ll wastes fumes gases and domestic and industrial trash sourced from homes industries and institutions hoornweq and bhadatata from the world bank reported that in that approximately billion urban dwellers generated over billion tons of waste every year this waste number was projected to reach billion tons per year by in it was calculated that every person generated kilograms of waste daily which translated to billion tons of solid waste per year this gure is projected to reach over billion tons in correlate this data to the fact that over of the total global population lives in urban centres and you realise that the disposal including conversion urban sci doiurbansci wwwmdpicomjournalurbansciurban sci of deterioration disintegration and storage of waste is a key issue confronting human survival and has major collateral damage to our environments and the earths nonhuman residents increased purchasing power demonstrated by a majority of city dwellers especially the middle class enabled by economic growth and improved disposable income has resulted in excessive consumption and demand for goods housing infrastructure electronics automobiles amongst others this consumption pattern has led to an increased generation of wastes from industries households ofces and the transportation sector additionally increased consumption results in increased tangible wastes in the packaging of goods and services to enable conveyance and to comply with burgeoning occupational health and safety protocol regimes that are further escalating this situation despite attempts at biodegradable materials and waste conversion the management of waste on site then becomes a major challenge with demand for residential space increasing waste inll sites are no longer deemed viable because there is little or no space left in cities to accommodate this waste the issue is omnipresent especially in developing countries which have piles of uncollected waste on almost every corner increasing waste generation exerts pressure on local municipal councils who are grappling with ways to reduce collect and effectively dispose of waste with a majority especially in developing countries struggling with collection and the sustenance of management efforts this struggle emanates from insufcient waste management infrastructure poor funding insufcient space and venues for waste disposal and inappropriate waste management technologies mukhtar et al relate that developing cities struggle with waste management due to their adoption of uncontextualized solutions such have been adopted without realising the recognisable differences between contexts policy challenges population and waste volume temporal growth and the underlying investments various cities require to address this issue in the longer perspective negative impacts like pollution ooding reduced supply of clean potable water increases in health burdens and challenges of climate change will become apparent the consequences of these variables render waste management efforts even more daunting as monetary funds are diverted into adaptive mitigation rather than addressing proper sourcebased waste management strategies this context is very prevalent in cotonou one of the main cities of the african nation of benin with an inexorable increase in population limited land availability coupled with scarce and inadequate waste management services the city of cotonou is facing an unprecedented administrative dilemma how to reduce waste provide human accommodation and increase employability in a bid to enhance liveability this research considers this dilemma and offers a conceptual framework based upon the theory of multilevel perspective mlp to transform plastic wastes by converting them into building bricks for accommodation lodgings such an endeavour could provide both work and housing for the people of cotonou as for all major projects the nancial side remains a major hurdle but there are possibilities for publicprivate partnerships and international aid in this instance to support this initiative background despite portonovo being the capital city of benin cotonou remains the largest city and main economic centre of the nation of benin cotonou hosts the cotonou international airport a major port together with a population of inhabitants in living in a total area of km despite these statistics dossou and glehouenoudossou claim that more than half of the nations population is in cotonou these authors highlight the urgent need to address the issue of urban development from a sustainability perspective due to the increasing vulnerability of cotonou to sealevel rise one particular area that has dogged the cotonou authorities for decades is that of waste management brock and foeken recognised that collection and disposal of solid waste is a highly critical issue in urban areas in benin the world bank has

been viewed as an urgent problem and challenge requiring immediate action however despite an escalating volume of literature highlighting that waste should be viewed as a resource that can be utilised as a means to generate revenue to innovatively serve as an alternate input in select industries and sectors and thereby as a source of permanent employment little action has been effectively taken at a city or national level internationally as collaborating evidence romerohern ndez and romero argue that waste management practices have the potential to reduce costs and at the same time generate substantial revenue qualifying the viability of this circular economy initiative to generate revenue traditional methods of waste management strategies are being phased out in favour of the reuse remanufacturing and recycling of different materials we argue that having a rationally planned and managed urban centre is a prerequisite for proper waste control monitoring and management in such cases it becomes possible to provide incentives to reduce waste generation as well as to introduce green taxes focusing on ensuring reduction and proper disposal of waste through those taxes and application of a polluter pays initiative local governments are able create new revenue streams as well as to encourage waste reduction and the application of the rsreduce reuse and recycle in addition besides those measures various cities are utilising waste as a source of energy this initiative facilitates the reduction of greenhouse gases ghg and provides an additional option for energy security the positives of these initiatives have however been disputed as having negative impacts upon the environment through recycling especially in cases where waste sorting is practiced different industries are able to ensure quality raw materials that yield products such as asphalt for road paving metal chain links concrete blocks and wood for diverse construction applications amongst many other uses for example general motors has related how this strategy has contributed to the diversication of their revenue sources through the sale of unwanted and unused cardboard and leftover steel in through the sale of leftover cardboard the company was making us per month waste generated from the electronics sector is an increasing challenge but there are recycling potentials present silicon has become an irreplaceable raw material in the production of solar panels which are key in the renewable energy drive and have been adopted in many economies in london as reported by mitchell a circular economy model enabled the earning of bn in and the gure is projected to grow at a rate of yearly for this reason stahel advocates for the rethinking and redesigning of products to ensure a reasonable lifecycle and for transferability of use into other sectors after they have become obsolete in their primary aim this is known as closing loops the increasing adoption of circular economy models not only allows for reuse and waste valorisation but has been instrumental in economic growth through the creation of jobs for both skilled and unskilled workforces in the european union it is reported that the repairing of different materials has contributed signicantly in job creation with almost half of people employed under a circular economy this has shown to encourage the creation of jobs in sectors like energy transportation manufacturing and building amongst others the sale and resale of old and recycled materials in nations such as china united states and the european union has also been seen to contribute signicantly to job creation and ultimately in supporting the economy esposito et al claim that remanufacturing activities created over new jobs in the united states alone in and the trend is set to expand further mitchell reported that the adoption of circular oriented economies would inevitably equate to an increase in demand for labour thus helping in the local economy and societal levelsurban sci of methodology this paper considers the expanding issue of waste management in cotonou benin and proposes a new model to achieve a circular economy model for waste reuse that is coupled with addressing cotonous issues of housing an increasing population and the relocation of slum dwellers into quality housing units the approach argued is an approach that provides a theoretical foundation that ensures a coherent and inclusive implementation policy section offers a literature review of waste management and conversion techniques currently in adoption and introduces the identied social tool the sociotechnical transition theory following which a review of literature was performed to understand waste composition in benin section proposes a new model that is set to better respond to the local challenges and section discusses its implementation potential contributions to society and the novelty of the approach literature review practices in waste management and waste conversion efforts to address waste has led to an increasing body of literature investigating waste management and waste conversion even though it is known that waste leads to environmental degradation and increased health problems it has been shown to also create revenue for local residents create employment and help solve building and construction challenges while providing an alternative revenue stream for local government amongst others in the recent past there has been numerous strategies aimed at converting waste into reusable products in numerous municipalities both organic and nonorganic wastes are now being converted into usable fueloften biofuels this is resulting in a strategy that patni et al view as an alternative to fossil energy generation organic wastes such as food and garden wastes are being converted into composts as in ireland while in other areas as explained by dou et al some of these wastes are valuable in making nutritious animal feeds especially garden wastes with urbanisation and population increase exerting pressure on housing and infrastructural development sectors conversion of wastes into building materials has become a key adopted strategy for waste conversion in addition the conversion of wastes into construction materials has also been seen as a way to address environmental degradation issues and increasing energy consumption prompted by current construction technologies a case in point is the conversion of sugar industry waste sugarcane bagasse into cleaner energy and construction inputs such as bricks paver blocks and cement recycling of wastes such as plastics demolition wastes mining wastes and agrowastes have now become one way through which building and infrastructure development materials of comparable standards to readily available market products are being produced in different nations dakwale and ralegaonkar posit that wastes from the demolition of old structures can be converted into ecobricks which are of suitable high quality and light weight for use in the construction of different housing structures wastes from similar sources can also be used in infrastructure development hence rediverting them from landlls liuzzi et al explain how different agrowastes are now being converted to produce high quality and sustainable insulation materials to replace the conventional nonrenewable materials which has been occurring for a long time in mediterranean areas similarly apriantis has explained how different waste materials like agricultural wastes which are rich in silica and industrial waste are being utilised in supplementing cementitious materials in concrete production gunnings et al have demonstrated how aggregate from different waste matters when treated with carbon dioxide can be converted into valuable products such as concrete construction blocks and substrates for green roofs hence beneting the united kingdom construction sector they argue that production of these secondary aggregates relieves the environment from the conventional virgin aggregates extraction and the authors note the concern to environmental issuesurban sci of linked to source material their report is supported by tripathi who shares how different wastes including aggregates are being valorised into building materials that meet

the desired course of action is orientedurban sci of towards sustainability through the smart management of plastic wastes and hence there is need to select which level of the mlp should be pondered upon as the pressure point geels offers an insight on the matter of pressure points and posits that transition management through such a strategy focuses essentially on the lowest level of the mlp model the niche the niche is where radical innovation emerges and where the whole system can be geared into a sustainable vision critiques of the mlp model have been offered by several researchers smith et al have highlighted the need to consider an extension of the model through a thorough focus on the central role of power in sociotechnical transitions other criticisms argue for the need to consider an expansion of the concept of change into interpretivism and relationism as advanced by genus and coles while shove and walker have identied the need to consider other theories of change in a bid to explain sociotechnical changes within a society nonetheless the scope of this paper is limited to the original narrative of the mlp as proposed by shove and walker with the main drivers of change being the three planes of i niche innovations ii sociotechnical regimes and iii sociotechnical landscapes niche innovations the core dimension of the mlp lies within a niche which refers to specic dimensions of a particular society the users within a niche have specic demands and are the main proponents of change kemp et al and hoogma et al have identied three major social dynamics within niches being learning processes that involve an understanding of issues pertaining to infrastructural requirements market demands and policy dynamics within the end users the vision of innovative ideas and practices that act as the conspicuous dimension that will attract funding and constructing new social networks geared principally at promoting new innovations geels posits that through social projects the main proponents within each niche could be exposed to the innovations being proposed on a rsthand basis this provides an impetus for promoting a general acceptance of the model of change being proposed for example the niche level for plastic waste transformation in cotonou lies within the need of inhabitants having access to proper municipal services and housing the need creates the drive for change sociotechnical regimes giddens described sociotechnical regimes as being the subtle rules that act as beacons in guiding and in coordinating enduser perceptions and actions within a particular social structure verbong and geels elaborated on three dimensions of the sociotechnical regime as being i material and technical elements ii network of actors and social groups and iii formal normative and cognitive guidelines that provide responsibilities frameworks for human actors however geels warns that sociotechnical regimes have rigid structures that permit restricted incremental upgrading provided that they follow already established pathways and do not radically upset extant stabilising mechanisms these mechanisms revolve around vested interests sunk investments and stable beliefs for example transforming plastic wastes into building bricks requires specic technical inputs from various groups including the municipal services and the main proponents of change social groups technical experts or cooperative societies who will be the ones directing the transformation of plastic wastesurban sci of sociotechnical landscapes above niche innovations and sociotechnical regimes there prevails a larger dimension known as the sociotechnical landscape geels posits that this landscape or context directly inuences the lower two dimensions of the mlp and includes infrastructural dimensions intricately linked within a web of specic values beliefs and the major economic situation for this change the sociotechnical landscape may involve the values and guidelines pertaining to the need for sustainable development according to dened sustainable development goals moreover the technical guidelines of the nancing body may also be part of the landscape level although these three levels are highly distinct with inherent sets of characteristics and domains geels acknowledges that the dynamics of transition occurs subtly through interactions at all levels for instance once there is an introduction of an innovation at the niche innovation level this will trigger an impetus leading to a change in the sociotechnical landscape the latter change trickles down to provide the necessary pressure to shake the established pillars of the regime and hence provide further opportunities for innovations this calls for a probing of the different pathways of change that prevail within the sociotechnical transition theory from an mlp perspective pathways of change these pathways as developed by geels and schot are transformation this endeavour is dependent upon an impetus evolving from external social groups or from the landscape level external pressure of this nature eventually leads to incremental changes causing subtle readjustment of the regimes in place as such the main actors of change are carried out by those at the regime level however geels and schot acknowledge the failure of such changes in causing any major innovation at the niche level reconguration such a pathway is driven forward when there are external pressures at the landscape level and when the regime in place faces problems as well resulting in a trickle down that shakes the established core attitudes at niche level these kinds of situations trigger certain niche innovations within the system like plugandplay methods or technical changes leading to a steady realignment of actual systems with their more pressing needs such realignments affect not only structural components but also lead to steady changes within practices beliefs and principles moreover in this pathway there is a welldened line of communication between regime and niche actors in terms of development and supply logistics technological substitution this pathway is characterised by a crisises originating at the regime level due to landscape pressures however such crises offer room for innovations at the niche level there is nicheaccumulation whereby the new technical upgrades move on and gain ground within bigger markets and eventually replace the obsolete ones moreover this pathway provides a competitive ground for niche actors competing with unavoidable actors at the regime level dealignment and realignment such a pathway originates when there are major changes at the landscape level these events eventually collapse the system in place there is dealignment of the system to make way for a realignment with a new system the new system is born out of major competitions between several nicheinnovations and through trial and error during a period of intense uncertainty as regime actors no longer trust the viability of the system in place waste characterisation in a survey carried out by tchakpa et al it was concluded that in there were tons of household waste being generated per day in cotonou upon closer scrutiny tchakpa et al characterised the household waste under subcategories as shown in table while waste collected from two markets were allocated into subgroups as shown in table urban sci of table household waste characterisation adapted from tchakpa et al category percentage biodegradable materials fine sand plastics paper metalscraps textiles glasses shoesleather bone and shells used batteries table market waste characterisation adapted from tchakpa et al category percentage biodegradable materials plastics cardboards and papers fine materials shells carapaces of crabs and pearls metals glasses textiles and foam fragments shoes and leather from this data an average of of plastic waste yields about tons of plastic waste per day offering huge avenues for transformation into sustainable housing bricks it should be noted though that only of waste is being collected and evacuated without any processing city hall of cotonou cited in tchakpa et al the remaining of uncollected wastes undoubtedly remain in the larger land and water environment affecting the very core of liveability in cotonou the rst step towards transforming plastic waste into bricks lies within the steps of sourcebased waste sorting and collection the reconguration pathway dictates that change originates from pressure at the landscape and regime levels in a topdown manoeuvre until innovations occur at the niche level such a dynamic of change already prevails at the landscape level in cotonou accordingly there is already an urgent need to address issues pertaining to waste management unemployment and housing hence the next step is to cater for a mindset change and to establish proper logistic frameworks for waste collection and sorting a new model calibrated to this particular context is required a proposed model the proposed model for managing plastic waste involves a closed loop economy in which the inhabitants of cotonou work in a bid to increase both their liveability and sustainability values within a dynamic urban structure since they are the main actors and end users of the desired change in plastic waste management this research proposes a reconguration pathway to infuse the dynamics of change within this sociotechnical dimension waste management and change at a niche level needs to be scrutinised at three levels waste collection and sorting transport and transformationurban sci of the three levels as stated above have particular characteristics of serving a human population because the human population is the primary recipient of jobs at each level the third level transformation is the end result where housing units can be made which in turn directly provides shelter for the local population hence closing the loop and rendering a circular model the proposed model is summarised in figure urban sci x for peer review of transformation the three levels as stated above have

was observed that linear thinking would eventually lead to a leakage of municipal budget to solve and address waste issues but that there was still a need to relocate slums however no funds were allocated for the relo cation of slum dwellers nor for the construction of alternative housing for these people the proposed model thus looks at responding to the challenges faced in benin by

the niche level will help realign the actual system in place with the actual needs of the subject place and societyurban sci of transformation jobs and revenue potential once the logistics of sorting out plastic waste from other refuse is undertaken and the plastic collected it can then be transported to a transformation plant from there it can undergo the required processing to reconstitute it into sustainable plastic bricks here again the very same niche actors need to be employed in a close economy system because they will be the driving force for oiling the gears towards sustainability the technical aspects of plastic waste transformation into bricks has been proled by liu et al hiremath et al and prasad et al these authors highlighted the gap in demand and supply of conventional building materials they also discussed the relative availability of laterite quarry raw materials and the huge amount of plastic waste being generated on a daily basis this situation offers avenues for converting plastic waste into bricks using bitumen as a binder these reconstituted plastic bricks consist of plastic offer more compressive strength than laterite stone and involve much less water absorption than stone moreover from an economic point of view hiremath et al estimated the cost of plastic waste collection to transformation into bricks to be at us per m and that the use of these bricks to build houses is cheaper than the use of laterite stone bricks another study conducted by vestergaard used only plastics collected from landlls and successfully transformed these plastics into bricks that were highly resistant to compression making them ideal as building blocks this latter technique can cater for very low income economies because less resources are used for the conversion process compared to the method advocated by hiremath et al these higher performance plasticbased bricks offer a sustainable solution for plastic waste disposal in cotonou together with offering a much cheaper alternative for lowcost housing these bricks could be used to build lowcost housing for the people of cotonou hence decreasing the propensity of illegal settlements moreover the economic repercussions of such an endeavour is that there are more jobs available and cheaper alternatives for lowcost housing recycling offers more job prospects than waste management for instance according to the institute for local self reliance ilsr the systematic removal of every tons of solid waste only generates six jobs while recycling for the same mass generates jobs the same workforce pattern has been evident in cotonou in a pilot recycling program called the program for the protection of the environment prap e run with the sainte rita community in cotonou such an endeavour relied upon locally available labour this labour was trained for waste collection for a total of subscribers these subscribers included both households and organisations and comprises a catchment of a community population of the subscribers had to pay a monthly fee of which was recoverable moreover such garbage collection activities generated us per year paving the way for the establishment of a community bank with a net worth of about us while generating permanent jobs out of which were taken by women prap e enrolled women for the collection of recyclable materials offering a daily income of us per day per person these gures are for only a small community of of cotonou inhabitants if these gures are extrapolated to the whole of cotonou there is potential for direct permanent jobs that can be created generating us per year nonetheless the prime issue is linked to the nancial aspects of such endeavours financing couth and trois argue that economic instruments like green taxes provide more avenues for sustainable change than direct policies however matete and trois posit that economic instruments are often not successful in waste management within developing countries principally due to their fragile nancial structures lack of transparency vested interests corruption and lack of human resources hence in seeking to provide a sustainable framework for waste management in cotonou there is a need to consider all the nancial aspects and economic structures within a sound policy environment the economic downfall of this activity cannot be demeaned and needs to be sustainable and ongoing so that the system stays functionally successful within a new sustainability resilience culture there is a need to involve community level niche actors in all sustainable wasteurban sci of management protocols to ensure the viability of this proposed solution for cotonou this argument is supported by colon and fawcett who also proposed a triangular system involving the municipality residents and microenterprises that offered technical and commercial resources that are not easily available within and to a community this includes transport of the waste to the industries for transformation moreover ahmed and ali posited that public private partnership ppp can offer a sustainable economic dimension that can maintain a sound framework for waste management in developing nations ppp can cater for job creation for those on the lowest social strata within any given arrangement ahmed and ali hail the empowering capacity of ppp for the local population but warn about the need for indepth empirical studies on projects to avoid potential loopholes these loopholes can lead to the collapse of the structure in place thus ahmed and ali recognised the need for policy alignment with the need of the society change hence joining in with the hallmarks of the reconguration pathway of change novelty of the proposed model while there has been new research and practices investigating waste management and conversion several researchers that highlighted the lack of nancing mechanisms and the lack of societal structures and inclusion yukalang et al explored the barriers to effective waste management in thailand and concluded that although there are budget provisions nancial issues related to waste fees collection are still not well articulated there is a perceived notion that waste has no nancial value hence discouraging an involvement in waste management nafula attributed the lack of sound nancial mechanisms in favour of an overreliance upon traditional nancing models despite being seen as ineffective in different parts of the world this adherence derails efforts by municipalities and governments to effectively integrate societal structures that aim at helping local communities in waste management efforts in south africa for instance madubula and makinta highlighted that there are no properly developed innovative waste management projects that would warrant job creation for the locals service delivery improvement and cost reduction the budget provisions in waste management however do include societal contributions hence they fail to facilitate effective inclusion of local communities this lack of societal inclusion in waste management and conversion contributes to the failure to adopt sustainable waste disposal methods at basic levels this has been seen in cases like accra as related by yoada et al however there is research that points to the benefit of adopting a circular economy to welcome a more robust economic model and to better include the society at numerous levels beccarello and foggia argue that adopting a circular economy allows for the inclusion of the society adoption results in the possibility of introducing strategies aimed at helping the reduction of waste and at the same time promoting the reuse and recycling of waste materials with circular economies municipalities are able to introduce waste fees and taxes thereby earning revenue that could be used at providing incentives geared towards waste reduction as well as compensating citizens directly working or involved in waste management the adoption of circular economies are also seen as an alternative source of employment for both skilled and nonskilled workers active in different remanufacturing sectors directly contributing to the economy remanufactured products thus become inputs in sectors like building and construction infrastructure development and flood prevention this helps in environmental sustainability reduction in pollution the promotion of optimal energy and water use but also allows for the construction of affordable residential areas stahel further shares that it is now possible for manufacturing companies to redesign products to allow for transferability into other sector sectors thereby helping in reducing the amount of waste products being released in the environment while increasing reusability and revenue generation across sectors the proposed model allows for this circular economy model from an economic standpoint and the sociotechnical transition theory ensures that there is an engagement with the local population at the various levels of engagement from the grassroots to policy level this type of approach can thus ensures a more inclusive and longterm planning perspectiveurban sci of conclusions this research undertook an exploratory case study of a potential solution to cater for plastic waste disposal and treatment informal settlements management and lowincome job creation within the city of cotonou benin the theoretical framework proposed draws upon the sociotechnical transition theory from a multilevel perspective mlp while the selected pathway of change resides within the hallmarks of a reconguration pathway the discussion has demonstrated that by engaging actors at the niche level into waste sorting at the source followed by subsequent collection and transformation into plasticbased construction bricks that there is potential to help alleviate poverty curb illegal disposal of waste and discourage illegal settlement construction shifting this community towards a more sustainable environment such an endeavour will promote liveability within the city of cotonou the nance part of such an endeavour should be executed through a publicprivate partnership due to its empowering power role upon the local population however there is also a need to understand all the dynamics of ow within the city of cotonou to ensure viability and sustainability of this project this paper aims at showcasing that waste management in benin can generate substantial revenue and that there is a mutualisation potential in solving the housing crisis while tackling the waste problem this approach can be replicated in other african countries experiencing the same issue this paper offers encouragement for policy makers to adopt similar practices author contributions za and dj conceived and designed the experiments za performed the experiments and analyzed the data za and dj wrote the paper funding this research
