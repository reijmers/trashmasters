and conclusion 
Since ecological and environmental sustainability are at the forefront 
of the economy, the circular economy is the economy for the future. The 
circular economy ’s central concept is human life’s long-term viability. 
The circular economy may offer a way to overcome the current pro-
duction and consumption model, which is limited in terms of energy 
resources. This economy is focused on a closed-loop system in which the 
primary energy and material resources are urban and industrial wastes. 
The main goal of the study was to analyze the effect of waste gen-
eration, recycling, renewable energy, biomass and soil pollution on the 
gross domestic product (GDP). For such a purpose adaptive neuro fuzzy 
inference system (ANFIS) was implemented. The consumption of metals 
as a percentage of Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) represents the 
most influential factor for GDP prediction. The main concluding remarks 
could be summed as follows:  
- Phosphorus balance per hectare is the most relevant factor for the 
GDP,  
- The combination of municipal waste generated and phosphorus 
balance per hectare is the most relevant combination of two factors 
for the GDP,  
- The combination of municipal waste generated, renewable energy 
supply and phosphorus balance per hectare is the most relevant 
combination of three factors for the GDP. 
Based on the results one can conclude the soil quality is very 
important factor for the economic development in circular economy. 
Municipal waste generated is only important if it is combined in the 
same time with the phosphorus balance per hectare. In other words one 
needs to change two factors in the same time in order to take effect of the Table 1 
RMSEs of the single parameters.
