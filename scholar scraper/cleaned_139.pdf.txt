History Nazi German waste recovery and the vision of a circular economy The case of waste paper and rags Heike Weber institut fr Philosophie Literatur Wissenschafts und technikgeschichte technische universitt Berlin Berlin Germany ABSTRACT In Nazi Germany reclaiming waste became an intrinsic com ponent of the regimes economy as well as its ideological racial and expansionist ambitions National Socialist interventions into waste streams began in with salvage campaigns The state then brought urban waste policies and municipal waste services under its control restructuring and Aryanising the waste salvage trade Moreover both consumers and producers were prompted to collect and reprocess waste Over time the gradual expansion of the Nazi waste recovery policies and campaigns here referred to as the Nazi waste exploitation regime brought forth a determined vision of a circular economy in which no waste whatsoever should escape its reclamation for the national community or Volksgemeinschaft This article sketches the actors structures and objectives of this waste exploitation regime for the case of rags and paper and uncovers its entanglement with Nazi racist and genocidal ideology and expansionism During the First as well as the Second World War governments of most warring nations implemented salvage drives and had scrap metal paper bones or other waste materials exploited as a supplementary national resource base to back their war economies Chickering pp Denton Weber Oldenziel Weber Thorsheim As explained in the introduction of this special issue the Second World War in particular changed the waste businesss economic conditions and its underlying moral economies Even if the material outcome of the salvage efforts is questionable certain waste materials metal scrap or bones for example supplied the war machines with pivotal resources while at the home front salvage drives served the ideological purpose of mobilising citizens retrieving sorting and accumulating waste for its reclamation were identified as a national duty and an act of supporting the war The nexus of war and waste recovery is particularly notorious for Nazi Germany yet its scope has so far been scarcely studied in business and economic history As reclamation played and still plays today a major role in metal generation and processing such as copper reclamation or the steel industrys substantial reliance on scrap metal inputs eco nomic historians have focussed on the Nazi hunt for metal resources and scrap salvage including tin copper or aluminium all of which were predominantly imported Blachut the Authors Published by i nforma uK Limited trading as taylor Francis GroupCONTACT Heike Weber hwebertuberlinde this is an o pen Access article distributed

WEBER Maier Scherner Both in Germany and in occupied territory the Nazi requisition of metals included public goods like church bells or statues Freeman Jonas Scherner has recently shown how extensive Nazi metal and scrap metal drives includ ing the requisition of copper wires bronze bells or other metal objects contributed to the socalled German metal miracle deutsches Metallwunder that allowed Nazi Germanys metal resources to last much longer than calculations on the basis of known inventories would have assumed Scherner In a similar vein the Nazi regime intensified bone recovery still a rather unexplored economic field despite its economic and military significance Denton Weber Vaupel Preis Imported bones as well as bones from slaughterhouses restaurants and households served as a resource for the contemporary bone and chemical industries and they delivered a wide spectrum of chemical semiproducts such as glues glycerine bone ash or neatsfoot oil needed in any precision equipment some of which were not producible by other means Other known examples for the National Socialist efforts to reclaim waste include the collection of tubes and foil by the Hitler Youth kitchen scraps by muni cipalities as well as rags shoes and used textiles through the wartime Reich Textile Collections ReichsspinnstoffSammlungen Berg Sudrow Weber Kstering has studied the Aryanisation of the national ragandbone trade while Anne Berg and Anne Sudrow have explored the ways in which con centration and extermination camp prisoners were forced to sort or reprocess waste materials These scattered studies indicate that the Nazi waste reclamation efforts were more than extreme examples of wartime salvage drives indeed waste salvage was an intrinsic com ponent of the Nazi economy as well as the regimes ideological racial and expansionist ambitions Surprisingly economic history lacks a systemic study on the field so far while there has been a proliferation of studies on Nazi autarky goals and the Nazi interventions into economy including the expropriation and Aryanisation of businesses the economic war mobilisation the exploitation of forced and slave labour and the plundering of Nazi occupied economies Boldorf Okazaki Buchheim Boldorf Klemann Kudryashov Schanetzky Tooze see also Denton Weber To underline the significance of waste salvage in Nazi Germany this article adopts Zsuzsa Gilles coinage of a waste regime Gille As Gille has argued any economy including the socialist Hungarian case studied by her is characterised by specific ways of identifying defining organising and treating waste Speaking of the Nazi waste exploita tion regime acknowledges the centrality that collecting and recovering waste had inside Nazi politics economics and ideology These activities included producing consuming and discarding alike Industries were prompted to reuse residues citizens were supposed to collect reusable wastes any wastage was to be avoided As we will see the diverse Nazi waste reclamation projects undertaken under the header of a lossless even circular German economy and the dogma of a total waste recovery were deeply interwoven with Nazi Germanys racist ideology its autarky goals and its aggressive and often mur derous exploitation strategies This article emphasises the pivotal role of waste salvage in the Nazi regime its economy and its ideology but it cannot compensate for the lack of studies providing an overview of the field It has the following focal points For one it concentrates on how the Nazis system atically tapped domestic waste in their reclamation policies and efforts For another rags BuSINESS HISTORY and waste paper significant trade goods of the salvage business of the time serve as case studies This article begins with an overview of the manifold National Socialist interventions into the field of waste between and before closer investigating the cases of rags and waste paper They underline how intrusive the Nazi waste exploitation regime became once we look not only into the salvage trade but also into production consumption and discard ing practices The article thus traces the Nazis interferences into the ragandbone trade as well as the textile and paper industry it describes the diverse industrial fields involved in the recirculation of rags and used paper and shows how diverse salvage campaigns and structures involved the participation of the German people The article concludes by critically reflecting on the Nazi vision of closing the loop through a total waste recovery While drawing on the existent research this article is mainly based on a detailed analysis of primary sources within a larger historical study on waste in twentieth century Germany Weber forthcoming Sources include trade journals of the salvage trade and its respective industrial branches journals for city administration or sanitary engineering contemporary technical and economic literature press and journal articles official propaganda as well as documents and archival material from the Bundesarchiv hereafter BArch and the Erhard Collection Sammlung Erhard based at the German Environment Agency Umweltbundesamt in Dessau Particularly helpful sources for the documentation of Nazi waste salvage projects were the decrees and instructions on Nazi salvage policy among them the Anordnungen und Richtlinien as well as a handful of contemporary manuals on waste salvage Fischer Petzold Stcker Tretter Archival documents produced by the Nazi bureaucracy contain pages of meticulous sta tistics on waste and Nazi propaganda reported detailed numbers on how much waste certain regions Gaue cities or schools had collected One should keep in mind however that these numbers served as propaganda Moreover clearcut categories for waste were absent except for the commercial determinations within the ragandbone trade For these reasons the article refrains from providing exact figures unless there is additional evidence supporting them In general understandings of and terms for waste of the s and s differed sub stantially from current ones The National Socialists used the umbrella term of old material Altstoffe or Altmaterial to refer to what we nowadays would call recyclable waste and contemporaries might not have identified old things like rags as rubbish at all In the follow ing terms such as waste salvage recovery or reclamation are used where the German equiv alent would be Altstoffverwertung Establishing the National Socialist waste exploitation regime Before the postwar era of affluence and mass consumption household waste was by and large an urban phenomenon By the late nineteenth century more and more municipalities established municipal waste services to keep cities clean At the same time the ragand bone man remained a common figure who bought reusable wastes from private house holds and small businesses and resold them to the salvage trade to make a living Diverse industrial sectors absorbed such wastes as old leather paper rags waste rubber or animal skins Jones Spadafora Weber and manifold enterprises were involved in waste reprocessing measures Trading and reprocessing metal scrap followed by rags then bones and fourth waste paper constituted the major fields of this business Weber H WEBER By municipal waste services had been set up in just over half of the German cities with and more inhabitants and a quarter of municipalities with to inhabitants Erhard a b The average German urbanite of the s was estimated to produce around to grams of daily waste mostly ashes followed by food scraps and then a mixture of broken pottery rags paper bones or other items Naumann Thiesing Where municipal waste services were lacking domestic waste was either reused or dumped in nearby pits which were emptied every now and then by carters or farmers But in any city recovering urban waste was still common Housewives burned paper in domestic fireplaces for heating and cooking handed kitchen scraps over to those who came into the city from the countryside to deliver milk or in smaller communities fed them to pigs hens or rabbits kept in the backyard The Nazi regime could thus easily revive traditional practices of reuse or intensify com mercial waste salvage activities Moreover in respect to its reverse logistics the agents and channels that collected transported sorted and traded waste from its diverse points of origin to its final reintegration in production Denton Weber the nascent Nazi waste exploitation regime mainly built on existent waste collecting and disposal infrastruc tures the ragandbone trade and municipal waste services with their labour force their facilities and their respective transport and trade networks In addition it engaged NSDAP members and Nazi organisations to serve in salvage campaigns or to monitor waste streams As early as NSDAP party officials began to study the existing municipal waste services Arbeitsgemeinschaft Rundfrage der Stadt Dsseldorf and party organisations initiated and organised waste salvage drives such as the youth organisations tin and foil collections In the Four Year Plan Vierjahresplan codified Nazi waste recovery policies in the name of autarky and an apparatus of party members began to supervise the imple mentation of the existing and forthcoming Nazi waste policies According to economic calculations the German Reich had invested million Reichsmark RM for the import surplus of rags followed by million RM for scrap iron nearly million for bones and million for waste paper funds that more rigid waste collections could save Stcker In the Nazi planning for waste salvage besides reducing such imports waste recla mation was supposed to enhance the material efficiency of existent resources Moreover in parallel to waste reclamation any wastage was to be eliminated in both private consumption and industrial production Consequently Nazi propaganda defined salvage along with thrift iness as a means to conserve national assets for the wellbeing of the autarkic German Volk It propagated the idea of a total recovery of any waste and Altstoffe were presented as genuine raw materials In the field of waste recovery came under the aegis of the newly established Reich Commissioners Office for the Recovery of Salvage Reichskommissariat fr Altmaterialverwertung hereafter RfA led by Wilhelm Ziegler and from onwards by Hans Heck When appointed in Ziegler envisioned a total waste material economy in the framework of the Four Year Plan which would extend beyond the traditional and in his eyes insufficient capture of waste materials by the existing waste business Ziegler p The RfA made a great effort to calculate the material and economic value of the waste material Altmaterial recording its amounts and sites of origin and trade in order to enhance the RfAs capture and control of the waste streams Establishing an outline of what became a decisive waste exploitation regime involved several levels state surveillance and policing closely monitored the waste streams any field BuSINESS HISTORY related to waste and its reclamation saw economic interventions from the ragandbone trade to municipalities and their waste services as well as domestic discarding practices and resource allocation for industry volunteer and to an increasing extent forced labour pro vided the necessary waste collecting and sorting work All of this was accompanied by massive propaganda that set out to redefine the moral economies of waste and helped to conceal the objectionable dimensions of the new waste order Moreover as in other fields of the Nazi regime different institutions competed for competencies and responsibilities while actors changed over time as novel positions or regulations were issued By the RfAs directives on waste recovery for instance filled an entire page book Anordnungen und Richtlinien The Nazi waste exploitation regime did not have a stable organisa tional structure even if earlier research has suggested so Huchting under Ziegler Commissioners for the Capture of Salvage Beauftragte fr Altmaterialerfassung were appointed on the levels of region Gau district Kreis and locality Ort The objective was to control waste flows at any stage in the case of household waste from the place of origin in urban households and apartment buildings to the ragandbone trade and the municipal waste services with their final disposal activities When competen cies were transferred in the s such commissioners made responsible for the capture of waste were appointed within the regional economic authorities Landeswirtschaftsmter The most severe interferences into the waste salvage business were its Aryanisation as it had traditionally been dominated by Jews and the socalled Pflichtsammler compulsory ragandbone men system of Aryan persons now were appointed by the regional Commissioners for the Capture of Salvage Gaubeauftragte fr Altmaterialerfassung to service predefined districts regions or urban neighbourhoods as ragandbone men Kstering Moreover the prices of reusable waste Altstoffe and sorting categories were regulated for each stage of the trade from the ragandbone mens trade at the households door up the hierarchical stages of the wastes gradual sorting on its way back to final reprocessing In the German Reich had counted enterprises in the ragandbone trade next to scrap metal businesses and operations dealing with skins and furs Fischer p Kstering Most of these businesses were oneman companies with family members giving a helping hand Only five percent of the ragandbone busi nesses employed six or more workers and only nine major companies had a workforce of or more In total around people found work in the waste business including the estimated number of around ragandbone men Tretter pp Ksterings research suggests that the number of Altstoff businesses shrank to around a third due to Aryanisation and then to the recruitment of soldiers for the front Kstering By sum mer Hans Heck confronted the fact that ragandbone men were serving as soldiers leaving only around peddling collectors to channel local waste into the waste business Heck b As a consequence schools were transformed into major waste col lection centres Contemporary waste salvage included production trade and domestic waste The Nazi waste exploitation regime targeted household waste in particular even if domestic con sumption hardly rose over the s and would be rationed from onwards Here the ideological function was essential as waste collections and salvage campaigns mobilised the average German citizen in his or her everyday life for the regimes aims In cities public housing and apartment buildings were asked to locate not only the specific bin for kitchen H WEBER scraps but also a container for Altstoffe which should serve as a socalled precollection point Vorsammelstelle for items such as waste paper These precollection points were to be looked after by local caretakers or dedicated representatives of Nazi organisations such as the NSFrauenschaft National Socialist Womens League or the Reichsluftschutzbund National Air Raid Protection League They were supposed to oversee the bins usage and thus their neighbours discarding practices and manage the absorption of the collected waste by the ragandbone trade In the long run this highly decentralised dispersed precollection point system never operated as desired and authorities regularly repeated the call to implement them In a parallel development from onwards towns of inhabitants or more were obliged to salvage Altstoffe at the final stage of waste disposal either at municipal dumps or inside the waste incineration plants which operated in just four cities Calculations by the Four Year Plan Authority Vierjahresplanbehrde claimed that around ten percent of the dumped waste could be recovered while in practice municipalities reclaimed significantly less and only material of minor quality Kstering p ungewitter pp f Many municipal waste services drew upon forced labour to keep their services running and to implement the waste salvage obligations It is difficult to decide where coercion and where collaboration were at work many of these interferences were conflictual as they trimmed existing competencies or trades others were characterised by cooperation An outstanding example for the latter with clear instances of cooperation between Nazi representatives the ragandbone trade or even municipal waste services occurred in with the socalled decluttering campaigns from urban attics and rural sheds and barns Entrmpelung von Landschaft und Dorf and Entrmpelung der Dachbden respectively Defined as airraid protection old papers or furniture stored in attics for future use would easily burn when bombed these campaigns allowed the confiscation of unused old things for salvage rural households were especially attractive targets as those with large storage space often hoarded old metal objects Supported by the local police members of the Nazi party the SA or the NSV the National Socialist Peoples Welfare cleared the attics and transported the waste to the local ragand bone trade In Wrzburg for example the decluttering campaigns took the form of regular bulk waste collections operated by the municipal waste service in cooperation with the civil airraid authorities once sorted the waste materials were sold to the ragandbone trade Gemeindetag p The decluttering campaigns had mixed objectives as they combined airraid protection and waste salvage even if propaganda emphasised the former Instructions issued on July for the actors involved within the Altstoff sector were quite clear about these combined motives they stated that the campaigns should first render attics fireproof second reclaim reusable objects for ethnic comrades Volksgenossen in need and third recover resources by seizing salvage material Anordnungen und Richtlinien p f From reports of the exiled socialist party hereafter SOPADE we know that individual citizens complained about these campaigns as they often also seized piles of pulp novels or old diaries as waste paper and took away old wires tools or bicycles these citizens understood the salvage campaigns as statesanctioned theft SOPADE Oct pp f A Bericht aus RheinlandWestfalen SOPADE June p A Richtlinien fr die Arbeit der Luftschutzhauswarte zur Altmaterialerfassung im Rahmen des Vierjahresplans Such historical records on the citizens willingness or aversion to participate in waste salvage BuSINESS HISTORY are rare and we must acknowledge that peoples support for the Nazi waste campaigns was by far not univocal In economic terms the rigidity of the Nazi waste exploitation regime hardly made sense and it was feasible only by exploiting volunteer as well as forced labour which upheld the waste salvages reverse logistics Salvage drives represented ritualistic performances of the national community or Volksgemeinschaft while the domestic practice of separating wastes was defined as the daily responsibility of the German housewife It was particularly house wives and school children who sorted collected and microtransported waste materials free of charge or with symbolic bonuses In early when the compulsory collectors Pflichtsammler were increasingly lacking schools became waste collection centres under the supervision of regional economic authorities Landeswirtschaftsmter Anordnungen und Richtlinien p Fischer pp Kstering School children now had to bring scrap materials to their schools where teaching staff had to act as salvage teachers Altstofflehrer checked the deliveries and channelled them to the ragandbone business The other pillar of the waste work force was constituted by forced and slave labour and it would eventually dominate the reverse logistics within the waste salvage trade A August decree enabled Nazi authorities to have prisoners do waste work Prisons now turned into dismantling facilities for electrical and technical equipment such as radios gas metres motors capacitors or light fittings Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung addendum ungewitter pp f In addition Jews were forced to do waste labour and many municipalities relied on this exploitation scheme to comply with the imposed waste salvage obligations Soon foreign prisoners of war and forced labourers were assigned to do waste work Concentration and extermination camps eventually served as relays or dismantling and refurbishing stations for waste recovery Berg Sudrow Moreover even textiles hair or gold extracted from Holocaust victims were reused as waste resources Berg The regimes salvage efforts were by no means scaled back after when occupied economies began to function as sources of booty and buffer stock Quite to the contrary the Nazi regime intensified its waste exploitation strategies back home and imposed them on occupied economies Denton Oldenziel Veenis In scrap rags waste paper and used rubber were declared as vital to the war effort Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung which was a prerequisite for the allocation of transport facil ities and work force Forced labour soon began to dominate inside the reverse logistics of waste salvage work Moreover the systematic plundering of occupied territories included waste materials Next to and often in direct combination with forced labour the extraction of resources from occupied countries included extracting waste materials salvaging waste became a tool of war and of wartime exploitation Berg Denton a dimension largely ignored in the historical literature Reprocessing textile waste and rags Reiwolle as a needed complement to semi synthetic fibers Ranking second behind scrap metal in the early twentieth century waste business rags also constituted a significant material flow inside the Nazi waste exploitation regime Rags and other textile waste originating from private consumption as well as industrial production H WEBER used to be traded on a global scale and these waste materials were reprocessed for reuse in diverse fields In for instance German industry recovered tons of rags with approximately tons reused in the paper and cardboard industry roughly the same amount became fibres for the textile industry and tons were recovered elsewhere such as for upholstery Brasch p Highquality rags were made into banknotes lowquality rags into cleaning rags or roofing felt the final products consisting of rag and waste paper residues comprised a diverse array of goods everything from blankets to buff ing wheels and organic fertilisers In the German textile industry was the second largest economic sector behind the metal and iron industry As it largely depended on imported cotton and wool the Nazi economic planning for autarky meant that the German textile industry had to reduce the volumes of imported fibres and replace them with domestic heimische raw materials including fibres recovered from rags An economic study of the mids suggested that to percent of the German fibre need might be covered by sheep raising and to percent through rayon and staple fibre production the semisynthetic fibres of the day Kunstseide and Zellwolle while recovered fibres might cover even higher rates with a maximum of around percent Brasch pp f These numbers were much too optimistic Reprocessed fibres seem to have constituted around percent of the fibres processed in the German textile industry in with a total of tons of rags being channelled into textile production Petzold p f Other sources claim even higher volumes of around tons Frankfurter Zeitung Hschle p In any case this amount represented a substantial growth of the textile industrys quota of rag reuse when compared to the early s Moreover synthetic fibres attained a higher share as textile resource only by but even afterwards reprocessed fibres retained their critical role as a needed complement Their significance to the Nazi economy was presumedly higher than that of vegetable substitutes such as flax or bast whose utilisation for fibres was explored starting around Luxbacher Moreover in the situation of total war reprocessed fibres were needed for basic equipment such as insulating padding or protective fabrics National Socialist intervention in the textile industry began in Hschle p pp Economic history studies have shown how supervisory agencies oversaw the industrys resource inputs for cotton wool and other fibres and how the state succeeded in pushing textile manufactures to add rayon fibres into their products Jonas Scherner demonstrated that the German chemical industry complied with the National Socialist pro gramme to increase semisynthetic cellulose fibre production without any drastic coercion since it envisioned growing markets for the novel fibres Scherner The pro duction of semisynthetic fibres Zellwolle and Kunstseide rose from tons in to tons in with nearly half of the necessary wood or pulpbased cellulose being imported Schanetzky p Scherner p The semisynthetics fibres now outdid the reprocessed fibres in their significance as a resource of the textile industry as they represented around to percent of textile fibres consumed in Nazi Germany with a subsequent maximum of over percent Recovered fibres figured as a needed complement to the synthesised substitute Ersatz products of the German chemical industry and they remained an essential pillar for fibre supply inside the textile and other industries The situation differed in many ways from the case of synthetic fibres which promised potential future markets Recovered fibres seemed BuSINESS HISTORY to have indeed figured as a reserve where the Nazi system of resource allocation limited the use of more appropriate fibres even if they resulted in inferior material qualities repro cessed fibres lost quality and length with every lifecyle and recovery process Consequently salvage experts assumed that rags could tide over the shortage of fibre supplies for a max imum of eight years and some argued that their share in total fibre consumption would be limited to percent Petzold pp f In the s rags from households still represented profitable objects of purchase for the local ragandbone men Inside the Nazi system of compulsory collectors Pflichtsammler these were paid around Pfennige for one kilogram of coloured rags and Pfennige for woollen rags when delivering them to the next stage of the ragandbone trade while used newspapers only yielded three Pfennige per kilogram Petzold p The Nazi waste exploitation regime aimed to tap increasing amounts of rags from households and prefer ably at low costs Exploiting schools as waste collection centres was one means to do so establishing a yearly Reich Textile Collection Reichsspinnstoffsammlung from to was another If we are to believe the painstakingly recorded figures on the results of school collections school children accumulated around tons of rags to tons of rags annually Weber forthcoming These are astonishing results for that time because domestic waste was minimised by wartime scarcity and rationing Nearly any con sumer good from textiles to paper or kitchenware was subject to a rationed economy and ration cards for clothing Reichskleiderkarten had been in effect since Buchheim p Most housewives tended to reuse mend or patch textiles where possible with pieces of clothing being fashioned from bedcovers or other reusable cloth Drr pp f The annual Reich Textile Collections from to prompted citizens to hand over any domestic rag or unused cloth Consumption statistics from around claimed that old textiles could amount to tons annually but only half that amount had been recovered so far AlaAnzeigenAktiengesellschaft p NSDAP Reichsorganisationsleiter und Reichsbeauftragter fr Altmaterialerfassung The missing remainder was sus pected to be hoarded in the rag bags commonly kept by housewives a private reserve which was claimed for the national war economy In the duty of honour of the entire German people was called upon and the German community of destiny was confirmed by oath propaganda posters filed in NSDAP Reichsorganisationsleiter und Reichsbeauftragter fr Altmaterialerfassung According to RfA statistics between tons and tons of rags clothing and linens were collected by the Reich Textile Collections Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung c d But these results contained a hidden source the textiles of dead extermination camp prisoners which found their way into the reprocessing industry through these salvage drives The Nazi regime boasted of its success in collecting materials But the real and unsolved challenges lay in the subsequent steps along the waste salvages reverse logistics namely in transporting sorting and reprocessing the different waste materials As described above the state also interfered in these intermediary stages between collection and final industrial reuse for example by Aryanising the rag trade Even more the established protocol for how to categorise and classify the more than different sorting grades along the hierarchical trade and sorting chain of the rag business beginning with the ragandbone men and H WEBER ending with the few largescale sorting enterprises were modified in order to keep more fibres in the textile sector Tretter p Along with forthcoming wartime effects many of these interferences impaired rather than boosted the industrial recovery of rags First the rag business suffered from its Aryanisation as it translated into a substantial loss of personnel expertise and established trading networks Inside this sector the sorting enterprise Lippmann Wolff Sohn situated in StuttgartZuffenhausen constituted the largest case of Aryanisation with several hundred employees it continued its operation under nonJewish ownership Rohproduktengewerbe For Berlin and its prominent rag trade it is estimated that Aryanisation resulted in a significant reduction of enterprises and by the number of wholesale rag businesses had shrunk by half Kstering p Second the labourintensive sorting work relied more and more on forced labour which lacked the necessary tacit knowledge A glance into a sorting enterprise for paper and textiles the Papier und TextilverwertungsGesellschaft Dresden illustrates the desperate conditions in the final years of war Altmaterialwirtschaft c In half of its work force consisted of forced labourers from Russia ukraine Poland France or Croatia For the sorters among them sorting grades were thus explained via visuals and captions in several different languages Aryanisation and the withdrawal of a skilled workforce irrevocably damaged the German rag trade A textbook on rag sorting from noted that the skills and expertise confined to trained personal had been extensively lost while it did not name the causes for this namely the Nazi interventions in the existing reverse logistics and its competences Bruns p Third the increased use of synthesised fibres caused disruptions within the traditional recovery processes Petzold p To separate traditional organic fibre mixtures work able procedures existed which recovered the valuable fibres but it was an open question for how to extract the Zellwolle fibres from textile cloth how to recognise their quality and how to apply such separation process to them under wartime conditions above all collecting and transporting waste turned into a logistical challenge Lacking means of transport meant that piles of rags were left to decay Longstored rags eventually became too inferior for even the roofing felt industry In the situation of total war rag reprocessing facilities eventually predominately fed the most basic needs of the war industry The mentioned enterprise the Papier und Textilverwertungs Gesellschaft for instance ran a sewing workshop that repaired sacks needed for transport and produced protective clothing Highquality rags were obviously lacking and the main goods reprocessed from rags were cleaning textiles blankets or padding and insulating material for industrial and military purposes Every leaf of paper destroys a green leaf in the forest paper reclamation and the Nazi propaganda of conserving the German woods Paper was once a product made entirely from waste products namely vegetable fibre rags When wood pulp substituted for rags as the main papermaking resource in the late nine teenth century much more paper could be produced while paper production continued to reprocess small amounts of rags and waste paper Mass produced paper was used nearly everywhere in offices newspapers packaging or bullet casing and in wartime paper and waste paper substituted for other more scarce materials such as textile fibres Pristed Thorsheim BuSINESS HISTORY In the early twentieth century waste paper became a common secondary resource in the paper industry In the united States where high volumes of packaging paper were in demand nearly a third of the industrys resources stemmed from waste paper by Weber This share of waste paper was lower in the German paper industry by around percent was reached when the German paper makers reprocessed tons of waste paper for a total production volume of million tons of paper Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung c The quota would amount to around percent in the late s and then peak at roughly percent in the early s Fischer pp As in the case of rags the Nazi regime not only interfered in the conditions of the salvage trade but also in those of paper production and consumption It applied fixed prices for waste paper and intervened in the existing reverse logistics Again total salvage volumes were increased by tapping domestic waste and by intensifying its yields Calculations sug gested that around percent of Germanys paper consumption took place in private house holds Petzold p and in contrast to textiles most domestic paper products were shortlived The Nazi salvage projects even targeted the socalled Knllpapier paper crum pled after its use which lacked any commercial value for the ragandbone men even the few Pfennige gained by delivering one kilogram of bundled old newspapers hardly justified the ragandbone mans tiresome amassing effort from local households At the same time the Nazi regime regulated paper production and paper products for example by constraining resources for production by formulating principles for the saving of packing material or by restricting the raw materials for bags and pouches to waste paper SchmidtBachem pp In commercial and adminis trative mailing letters were restricted to paper without any content of rags As in the case of reprocessing rags waste paper figured as a reserve for paper makers once the Nazi regime had decided to limit wood imports and to channel increasing wood pulp volumes to other industrial purposes a link stressed in internal documents When the Nazi apparatus recruited SA members for paper salvage collections the respective letters specified that the amount of collected used paper must be further increased in order to set German wood production free for other purposes Schmid p These initial waste paper collections of led to excess quantities which piled up and sometimes even decayed instead of being reused As a consequence the state obliged paper makers to reprocess set quotas of waste paper Beimischungszwang forcing many of them to modify processing methods Further regulations followed with the war The production of newspapers journals and books as well as paper consumption were severely limited Retailers eventually asked cus tomers to return used packing materials Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung b addendum p In the early s theatres and cinemas had to collect used tickets and programme leaflets for recovery In the reverse logistics were entirely modified in a way that shaped schools and the domestic precollection points Vorsammelstellen into main assembly junctions and limited the ragandbone trades role as solely a subordinate intermediary to paper makers It comes as no surprise that the sorting categories were now reshaped and reduced to basic sorts and in total different categories Fischer p the simplified system presumably enabled lay men to sort and grade paper In the final years of the war paper production volumes declined and limited paper consumption levels caused the available waste paper volumes to drop Given the substantial proportion of paper inside the waste bins of urban households in the s used paper constituted an obvious target within the Nazi waste exploitation H WEBER regime Figures for Hamburg show that paper and cardboard comprised around percent of the municipal waste bins content in the summer with winter amounts sinking to percent Neuy p In the cold season waste paper was regularly burned for heating in summer it helped to ignite the domestic cooking stoves Nazi propaganda tried to inhibit such individual paper burning which the NSDAP critiqued as squandering the assets of the people Schmidt p Educational material instructed housewives that they might if nothing else was available use paper to start a fire but then only one or two sheets Khn pp Salvage drives to collect domestic paper began as early as and were intensified from onwards The system of precollection points Vorsammelstellen was intended to enhance the capture of waste paper in particular crumpled paper as ragandbone men regularly undermined the official order to collect it While these failed for other waste mate rials they seemed to have operated to some degree for paper Nazi caretakers were supposed to hand the domestic waste paper over to the ragandbone trade and they would receive between two to three Reichmarks per kilograms in Anordnungen und Richtlinien p Eventually even smaller municipalities were pushed to install paper precol lection points with the help of SA men who were to ensure the final delivery to the ragand bone trade Schmid pp Moreover some cities such as Erfurt Stuttgart and Knigsberg installed separate waste paper collections Fischer p Gemeindetag pp Neuy p Schwarz Stuttgarts municipal waste service transported the collected waste paper directly to local paper factories purportedly the proceeds paid for the costs of collection Knigsberg delivered its waste paper to a local pulp mill and forced Jews to do the waste sorting work Wartime conditions forced the reverse logistics for waste paper to adapt In coordination with the regional economic authorities Landeswirtschaftsmter and the local commissioners for waste salvage the paper industry needed to provide trucks to channel waste paper directly into its production facilities Fischer pp f In the local NSDAP representatives were made responsible for paper collection Altmaterialwirtschaft a Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung a Late that year a new bonus scheme was established When delivering a certain amount of waste paper citizens received a token that authorised them to acquire a given amount of paper products Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung b A similar barter system existed for bones which were com pensated with tokens for soap acquisition But what is more the Nazi regime requisitioned new sources for waste paper such as libraries and archives a process that Peter Thorsheim has also described in Great Britains wartime waste salvage efforts Thorsheim The retention period for business and public administration files was lowered and old books were pulled from libraries for salvage in dispensable archival materials were pulled from public administrations Altmaterialwirtschaft b The plan to extract such sleeping reserves of old paper from libraries archives or offices began as early as in July Anordnungen und Richtlinien pp Fischer p Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung p Similar to the case of metal collections Scherner these removals most likely were postponed due to fears of civil resistance On the one hand waste paper recovery compensated for sinking wood and pulp imports in an autarkic economy that limited imports to save foreign exchange In Germany BuSINESS HISTORY had imported around percent of the wood for paper production from Northern and Eastern Europe the National Socialist autarky goals had shrunk this to percent by the late s Fischer p Laufer p Mutz p On the other hand waste paper reprocessing helped the Nazi economic planners to free up wood resources for other nonpaper production purposes once wood pulp became an increasingly important com ponent of the autarkic policies The growing field of woodbased chemistry Holzchemie pushed logging in order to produce more or new derivates such as wood cellulose glucose or semisynthetic fibres Brauer pp f Trendelenburg Nazi propaganda prompted citizens to salvage paper in order to help save Germanys national wealth and to efficiently use existent domestic resources But from onwards a further motivation appeared in propaganda and soon dominated the discourse Waste paper salvage was propagated by the argument to conserve German forests an argument we would nowadays perceive as green but which stood in stark contrast to the overexploita tion of wood by the German chemical industry at that time Every leaf of paper destroys a green leaf in the forest the RfA stated in a appeal for the collection of old paper Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung c Calls for paper salvage drives claimed that salvaged paper helps preserve the German wood According to RfA figures tons of used paper saved a total of square metres of woods a relation visualised in schematic drawings of the German forest and the saved amount of wood Figure Some drawings displayed the widely used fastgrowing spruce Figure included an oak tree on the left a paradigmatic icon of the German wood myth so central to Nazi ideology Imort Zechner pp Back then as now reusing waste paper in paper making preserved resources it saved pulp sulphur coal and energy Breitkopf But within the Nazi economy the pulp savings by paper salvage were not left as green leaves in domestic forests but consumed by the woodbased chemistry Moreover reprocessing growing amounts of waste paper in the paper industry was only one way to fill the gap left behind by sinking wood imports another was gaining access to the forests of Austria and from onwards exploiting the woods of Northern and Eastern occupied countries The Nazi vision of total waste recovery and closed material loops The driving actors of the Nazi waste exploitation regime were motivated by the idea of fully incorporating wastes into agrarian and industrial production and profiting from waste as a seemingly infinitely renewable reserve where raw materials were scarce Such a fantasy of reclamation was not novel and it had also characterised nineteenth century hopes to reutilise waste generated by new production processes Cooper Nevertheless the Nazi case stands out in its ideology of a total waste recovery inside the German Volksgemeinschaft and its explicit claim of a circular management of material flows that would keep these materials inside closed loops Terms numbers and visualisations played a major role in propagating these ideas The adjective total became as present in the Nazi waste propaganda as that of lossless Moreover the term Altstoff was equated with or even replaced by Rohstoff or raw material as if no reprocessing was needed as in Figure entitled The Raw Material Rag And next to excessive figures on waste amounts the metaphors of the circle and of a continuous flow H WEBER that transformed residues to resources and finally to finished products as also in Figure became key in the texts and visuals of the Nazi waste propaganda The National Socialist desire for total waste salvage produced extensive statistics and calculations on waste flows In retrospect the collated data on potentially available waste and salvaged waste amounts underlines the gaps between how much was generated as waste how much was being accumulated as potential resource and how much was ulti mately recovered in production In Nazi propaganda however these figures were pivotal Figure Propaganda poster by the Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung for waste paper recovery with the slogan Collecting used paper helps conserve the German wood Below the poster explains that tons of waste paper save cubic metres of wood o n the left oak trees are pictured next to the common fastgrowing spruce source Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin PLiBuSINESS HISTORY to underline both the Volksgemeinschafts need for expanding the exploitation of waste as well as its success so far achieved by salvage efforts Moreover on the side of Nazi bureau cracy counting every single gram of captured waste represented a performative act of contributing to the regimes desired total waste capture and recovery Over time the idea of closing the economys material flows by their circular management became a guiding directive in policies and propaganda discourse In when municipal waste services were obliged to establish salvage triage on municipal dumps in addition to the formation of local domestic precollection points an official in the Raw Material Distribution Business Group Geschftsgruppe Rohstoffverteilung declared this as an option to help capture any usable salvage and reroute it into the rawmaterial circle Tobler p Claus ungewitters propaganda book Using the Useless Verwertung des Wertlosen described the potential for waste recovery in multiple economic sectors including private consumption Next to municipal waste he treated sewage and how to recover its fat and nutrients content he explored the possibilities of utilising the residues of the chemical or forestrybased industries But he devoted just a few pages on what he termed a rational material economy which would have material cycles at its base ungewitter pp But by the time that Hans Heck summarised his thoughts on the waste salvage economy in the circulation metaphor had turned into a fixed idea Reichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung a Figure Didactic propaganda drawing of the Reichskommissariat fr Altmaterialverwertung on the raw Material r ag for use in school teaching similar flow charts existed for scrap iron waste paper and bones source r eichskommissar fr Altmaterialverwertung c H WEBER According to Heck an organically structured exploitation of scrap materials integrated into the larger economy would be of towering significance for the future raw materials economy based on complete cycles of raw materials Likewise salvage drives were propa gated by the circulation metaphor In Hecks terms the Reich Textile Collection ReichsspinnstoffSammlung for instance was supposed to make the German people aware that there is a perpetual cycle of raw materials if the individual consumer discarded or destroyed a piece of clothing or a rag instead of recovering it only because it had lost in personal value the cycle was broken and could no longer effect its usefulness for the collectivity Heck a p The metaphor of the closed loop also found its way into the wider discourse on household or national economics To name but one of many examples published in journals and the press the German Womens Welfare Organisation stated in its official journal that the idea of using the technical possibilities to bring the raw materials in waste products into a continual cycle must be considered as one of the most inge nious ideas in terms of political economy ever to be thought up Deutsche Hauswirtschaft Similar to the circle or circulation metaphor in written discourse or speeches visual pro paganda simplified the complexities of waste recovery in its imagery Flow charts suggested continuous flows or even closed loops between waste material and finished product The propaganda poster for the bonesoap exchange of for instance showed a hand holding a piece of soap over a plate covered with bones Figure represents a widely distributed didactic drawing on the rag recovery process under the header The Raw Material Rag it visualised how the rags on the upper left side transformed into products such as sofas cushions and other padding linens roofing felts fertilisers letters or banknotes and yarn or cloth The drawing reduced the usually female sorting workforce to four skipped the question of several hundred sorting grades and oversimplified the reprocessing process On the left oil is extracted from rags on the right the three main industrial branches upholstery paper and textile industries reuse rags for their final products What is left out from the picture is the fact that rags not only found their way into con sumer products on the contrary industrial and military needs eventually dominated But even if the reprocessing quotas of the textile industry and in particular also that of the paper industry were enhanced the muchvaunted closed circle was neither attained nor even attainable since any waste reclamation or recycling necessarily involves losses a fact that Nazi waste experts were aware of By contrast Nazi waste propaganda ignored the expen ditures costs inefficiencies and wastage which were bound up with the collection and processing of scrap materials but expressed the idea that mechanical and chemical trans formation processes would close the material loop Conclusion how unique was the Nazi waste exploitation regime Recycling waste is no green invention of environmentalconscious societies Oldenziel Weber Reith for most of human history utilising waste was the norm In the early twentieth century recovering waste materials such as paper rags or bones still con tributed to the economic balances of both industry and private homes while the First and BuSINESS HISTORY Second World Wars constituted periods in which warring nations intensified waste reclama tion for the purpose of warmaking What then makes the Nazi waste exploitation regime as I have termed it in this article so specific In contrast to other national wartime waste mobilisation programmes Denton Weber the Nazi waste exploitation regime set in well before the war In the initial years intensifying waste salvage was linked to the Nazi autarky goals and it was entangled with Nazi ideology and totalitarian rule Over time the nascent Nazi waste exploitation regime became part and parcel of racist Nazi ideology the regimes territorial expansion as well as its exploitation and extermination strategies At the level of rhetoric and propaganda the Nazi waste exploitation regime was driven by material efficiency and the idea of mobilising waste as a resource But the rigorous inter ventions into the existing waste trade and its reverse logistics caused manifold conflicts and disruptions inefficiencies as well as additional waste work The Aryanisation of the ragand bone trade undermined given expertise and trading networks the diverse parallel waste collecting efforts to approach the Nazi total recovery ideal were cost and labourintensive and only operable by exploiting volunteer as much as forced waste work At the core of the Nazi waste exploitation regime lay a rigid ideological claim namely to set up a lossless material economy which would expand the Reichs resource base even if additional municipal and national funds were needed and the given infrastructures of munic ipal waste services or the ragandbone trade were exhausted for that purpose The German Volk was asked to participate in waste salvage as a form of voluntary sacrifice to demonstrate loyalty to the nation its order and its prosperity while Jews and other socially expelled individuals were forced to do the dirty waste sorting work The Nazi salvage methods were imposed on occupied economies and concentration and extermination camps eventually figured as hubs in the reverse logistics of waste collection and salvage While the Japanese case shows some parallels Denton the latter refrained from the racist and ideolo gydriven murderous purge inside the waste workforce that characterised the Nazi case Like wartime waste salvage efforts elsewhere the Nazi waste exploitation regime generated familiar paradoxes Wartime shortages and rationing caused quantities and qualities of waste material to shrink and while still surprisingly vast amounts were tediously collected and sorted by voluntary and forced labour large proportions never made it back into production due to the manifold challenges of the reverse logistics such as declining material qualities lacking manpower and insufficient transport and processing facilities Moreover the Nazi vision of closing the material loop stood in stark contrast to the wartime situations in households industry or the waste trade but even more so to the destructive power and murdering of the German Reich and the waste fulness of war Past studies on the question of the Nazis greenness have shown that nature conservation and environmental protection though regularly propagated were rigidly subordinated to the objectives of autarkic economy and warmaking for instance in the case of German forestry Brggemeier et al Maier uektter The same is true for waste recovery Considering the named losses disruptions perversities and the contexts of war and exploitation a discussion on the potential effectiveness success or even the sustain ability of Nazi waste salvage is pointless altogether even if recycling quotas as we would call the share of secondary resources inside production today were enhanced By contrast the role of waste salvage for the Nazi economy and the mobilisation of the German people H WEBER cannot be overestimated In the considered cases rag recovery filled the gap of lacking fibre resources that the autarkic synthetic fibre project could not bridge waste paper helped save wood pulp that was needed in the chemical industry Contributing waste to the Nazi salvage channels was shaped as an essential element of daily live in Nazi Germany and became an act of supporting the war The fact that the Nazi waste exploitation regime propagated the idea of circular material flows can inform current debates While there are no direct lines between Nazi or wartime waste recovery and late twentieth century green recycling the historical case might serve as a critical warning to the vision of a circular economy which presently serves politics industry and consumers as a utopian hope to save the earths resources The extreme Nazi case makes evident that no waste recovery whatever its aspirations and methods is neutral Recycling cannot be reduced to economic and technical questions of its reverse logistics its reprocessing methods and its production techniques Rather waste salvage and recycling were and are deeply interwoven with ideology society economy and culture Acknowledgements For helpful comments and suggestions I would like to thank Chad Denton and the two anonymous reviewers as well as the
