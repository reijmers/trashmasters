chain food loss and waste management sustainability sustainable consumption and production a b s t r a c t the global agrifood sector is in a dire need of transitioning into sustainable consumption and produc tion patterns the circular economy concept offers a viable pathway to improve resource eciency and recover value from food loss and waste although china has made circular economy a strategic compo nent of its national development strategy it has faced multiple barriers which persisted in the fullscale implementation of sustainable food consumption and production we aimed to empirically investigate these barriers based on data from three key stakeholder groups in the food supply chains the food processors sales and distribution rms and consumers we quantied the causeandeffect relationships among barriers by the fuzzy decision makingtrial and evaluation laboratory analysis fuzzy dematel technique all groups identify weak enforcement of environmental regulations and lack of environmental education and accountability as key cause barriers in china our results suggest that policy level changes include enhanced regulatory attention and new educational initiatives will be required in china man agers should focus on waste separation and gaining economies of scale together these initiatives will help promote sustainable consumption and production for a paradigm shift to a circular agrifood supply chain system institution of chemical engineers published by elsevier bv all rights reserved introduction to ensure sustainable consumption and production scp pat terns is one of the sustainable development goals of the united nations sustainable consumption and production is about doing more and better with less it is also about decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation increasing re source eciency and promoting sustainable lifestyles united na tions the food sector has been one of the focus areas for making the transition to scp patterns because the sector is respon sible for about energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the world united nations according to the food and agriculture organization fao about onethird of the food produced for human consumption approximately bil lion tons worth around trillion is lost or wasted in food pro duction and harvesting salesdistribution and consumption stages corresponding author email address nkliuypnankaieducn y liu every year fao on the one hand the world needs to re duce food loss and waste along the supply chain to meet the in creasing consumption needs of a growing population partt et al toop et al on the other hand the current food waste management systems need an overhaul to maximize value recov ery taking multiple european countries as an example food waste accounts for about of the total municipal biowaste which is collected separately and treated by composting or anaerobic diges tion with biogas production european environment agency however the rate of separated biowaste collection averaged about only in and the remaining biowaste was not sepa rated from other municipal waste and thus lost for value recov ery european environment agency in many other coun tries including china food waste recycling is much less developed and food waste is often disposed of together with other municipal waste and sent to landlls the circular economy ce concept can support systemic changes required to increase implementation of scp measures and recover value from valuable food waste resources in recent years  institution of chemical engineers published by elsevier bv all rights reserved y liu lc wood vg venkatesh et al sustainable production and consumption ce has been increasingly recognized as a more sustainable alterna tive to the dominant linear ie take make and dispose economic model ghisellini et al which offers a new and compelling sustainability perspective farooque et al a ce nds its root in the concepts of industrial ecology biomimicry and cradle tocradle yuan et al mcdonough and braungart mentink it is an innovative industrial ecosystem that is restorative and regenerative by design ellen macarthur founda tion in ce technical materials eg metal and plastics are designed for recovery remanufacturing refurbishing and recy cling and biological materials eg fruit peels and chicken bones are safely returned to the biosphere to enhance natural capital by circulating the use of materials ce aims to improve resource e ciency with virtually no creation of waste ellen macarthur foun dation in a way that will reduce costs of both resources and energy as we shift towards scp broadbent in a fully circu lar economy forward supply chain operations recycling activities and value recovery from waste are powered by renewable energies so that materials circularity is achieved without creating negative environmental footprint such a vision although far from being a reality inspires the world to move in the right direction policymakers and business leaders worldwide have started to embrace ce as an innovative and more sustainable economic model several major economies including the european union china and japan have made ce part of their regionalnational de velopment strategy organizations including apple philips coca cola and ikea are committed to ce to enhance their sustainability performance to create value for their customers and other stake holders in the agrifood sector taking the uk as an example it could save annual landll cost by usd billion if organic food wastes were kept out of landlls other benets include a reduc tion of greenhouse gas emissions by million tonnes each year electricity generation of up to gwh each year through waste toelectricity technologies and organic compost to restore soil fer tility ellen macarthur foundation the world is in a dire need to ght environmental degradation and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change therefore it is of strategic importance to implement ce principles in food waste management despite these potential benets to scp in the agrifood sec tor it is not clear how progress can be made in developing and embedding ce principles into the industry due to the presence of multiple barriers these sustainability barriers are often inter twined so it is dicult to divide and address them sequentially han et al jurgilevich et al ghisellini et al in addition studies of food waste management have mainly focused on the consumption stage schanes et al similarly stud ies of barriers to sustainable food waste management have also fo cused on the consumption stage for example do carmo stangher lin and de barcellos and lazell although substan tial environmental impacts from food loss and waste also occur in the food processing and salesdistribution stages united na tions no study has systematically investigated sustainability barriers in these stages along with those in the consumption stage in the context of china it has been widely acknowledged that sup ply chains should be studied as systems as a supply chain players behavior and performance are inuenced by those of other players which is evidential in the bullwhip effect lee et al scp re quire collaboration and close coordination among multiple supply chain actors borrello et al therefore it is essential to em ploy a systems approach to investigate its implementation barriers our results narrow the knowledge gap by investigating barriers across multiple stakeholders in the forward supply chain includ ing food processors salesdistribution channels and consumers it provides a more holistic and systematic view to help overcome the barriers to sustainable food consumption and production from a ce perspective focusing on value recovery from food loss and waste in contrast to earlier works which tended to study challenges as isolated ones at the consumption stage this research investigates sustainability barriers in the context of the larger supply chain system in which an actor is embedded in applying such systems thinking can help uncover the interdependency among system ac tors and provide deeper understanding in the root causes of com plex problems therefore it can better predict behaviors and ulti mately adjust their outcomes richmond given that waste disposal behaviors vary in different cultures there is a need to study barriers in specic regional and cultural settings to take into account the effect of regionscultures the context of this study is china the largest developing coun try that has both great need and commitment to implement ce the insights offered from the research are not only applicable to agrifood businesses and their supply chain operations in china but also shed light on similar operations in many other economies that struggle with a transition to sustainable food consumption and production the research addresses the following research ques tions what are the key barriers hindering sustainable food consump tion and production for transitioning to a ce in china how can the interdependency between the barriers be uncov ered for identifying and overcoming the root cause barriers this research answers the rst question by identifying a list of important barriers based on literature and insights from the chinese agrifood sector the multiple barriers inuence decision makers and suggest that a multicriteria decisionmaking model mcdm would be valuable elikbilek and tysz it ad dresses the second question by utilizing the fuzzy decisionmaking trial and evaluation laboratory technique fuzzy dematel to systematically analyze the complicated interdependency between barriers fuzzy dematel is a fuzzy set extension to the stan dard dematel technique gabus and fontela in compar ison with standard dematel fuzzy dematel is more advanta geous because it can address the inherent vagueness bias and un certainty in human judgments which are part of the concerned re search phenomenon wu and lee lin its method ological procedures are similar to greybased dematel another widely used variation to the standard dematel si et al we used fuzzy dematel because it has greater capacity than greybased dematel in handling vagueness fuzzy dematel uses threedimensional triangular fuzzy numbers tfns eg kumar et al while greybased dematel uses two dimensional grey numbers eg to represent the linguistic variables based on the ndings from the fuzzy dematel analysis we discuss managerial and policy implications on how the barriers can be addressed the rest of the paper is organized as follows section re views relevant literature section describes the methodology and data collection procedure section presents the results and analysis

reduction is the major global economic and political agenda as one third of globally produced food is lost or wasted in the food chain corrado et al this is especially becoming imperative amidst the call for explor ing the connection between food waste generation and waste man agement under the broader framework of sustainable production and consumption lehtokunnas et al in the food systems scp face many issues due to complex interdependency in a web of political institutional and technological factors heller and ke oleian papargyropoulou et al it is also closely linked to their value chain governance patterns messner et al it is also imperative to recognize the food categories with high envi ronmental intensity beretta and hellweg some of the other unique challenges that food supply chains face include frequent production setups strict regulations perishability storage condi tion requirements transport damages processing loss contamina tion and recycling issues alansari et al behzadi et al sonesson et al matzembacher et al these challenges are further escalated by widespread growth and struc tural shift in the food consumption pattern of urban and ru ral consumers and more challenge is to have the conceptual un derstanding on the nature of food wastes and their treatment dobermann and nelson matzembacher et al hence there is a growing need to theorize sustainable food supply chains sala et al zhu et al matzembacher et al food waste management is one of the key challenges in sus tainable food consumption and production garciaherrero et al as mentioned earlier food loss and waste account for about onethird of the global food production equal to billion tons per year a few studies reported the magnitude of food losses and wastes in the production and consumption stages with respect to developed and developing countries smil partt et al gustavsson et al their causes are diverse buzby and hyman girotto et al luo et al some prod uct wastes are not suitable for consumption they need to undergo reprocessing for value recovery sonnino and mcwilliam some even pose environmental threats and hygiene problems gustavsson et al besides it is dicult to track or separate the costs from the perspective of organization that generates the waste eriksson et al in the meantime new technologies eg industry and enhanced collaboration may support rms to address these threats and recover more value rosa et al lately literature shows interest in developing strategies to manage those products wastes effectively as they are recognized as an alternative way to food supply stancu et al however the available studies appear to be biased towards the quantication of wastes and losses by projecting them as a negative phenomenon eriksson et al amidst this researchers demand the need for fresh perspectives of food waste generation studies from multi stakeholder perspectives corrodo et al in china alone the annual food waste is in the range of billion chinese renminbi rmb chen et al the loss of grains or liangshi in chinese in the entire supply chain is about with the consumption stage being the single largest source of food waste the estimated loss in storage pro cessing and distribution is and respectively this level of waste is equivalent to about billion m of water foot print and about million hectares of land being cultivated in vain liu et al besides the postharvest stage contributes around million tons wastage in storage mainly due to fungi ro dents and insects zhao and huang sag and ndrc liu et al additionally there are some signicant process ing transportation and distribution losses in the system liu and bai ce oriented food loss and waste management the ce concept offers a new perspective to sustainable food loss and waste management as it considers wastes as resources for value recovery cicatiello et al as mentioned earlier di verting organic food wastes from landlls could generate tremen dous economic and environmental benets ellen macarthur foun dation in a recent study santagata et al summa rize the challenges and opportunities of food waste recovery in ce the research on food value chain primarily on the produc tion business and industry trends the focus on transition to wards a circular economy is topical on food value chain and waste literature till recently the focus has been mostly on consumers lehtokunnas et al at the policy level it is the part of farmtofork strategy proposed by the circular economy package as a part of global initiative corrado et al however such a mission requires a systems approach because food loss and waste occur at multiple stages along the supply chain including agricul tural production postharvest handling and storage processing dis tribution and consumption liu the multiple subsystems and components mean that integrated decision making is crucial lechner and reimann jabbour et al therefore ce oriented food loss and waste management requires close coordina tion of supply chain actors including farmers bread producers re tailers compostable manufacturers insect breeders livestock farm ers and consumers borrello et al its rst step is to collect and sort a large variety of food wastes eciently from spatially dispersed sources afterwards food wastes are treated by appro priate value recovery options efforts should be made by managers to reduce resource use and waste by carefully assessing supplier capabilities and their supply network to ensure waste is not only avoided at their facilities but also at other facilities along the sup ply chain bai et al throughout these effort s there remain challenges for rms that wish to transition to a protable ce busi ness model with many barriers eg customer behavior or nan cial limitations and constraints that are outside of the manage rial control loon and wassenhove in a study de sadeleer et al analyzed the performance of transition into ce and waste prevention through recycling and energy recovery barriers to ce implementation in china despite of a promising vision ce implementation faces a vari ety of barriers govindan and hasanagic tura et al and de jesus and mendona provided general classications of ce implementation barriers given that ce implementation bar riers are context specic most barrier studies focused on a specic regioncountry for example kirchherr et al investigated barriers in the european union and mont et al focused on the sweden context this subsection reviews barriers to ce imple mentation in china which is the context of this study ce implementation in china has been driven by government agencies such as the national development reform commission ndrc and ministry of environmental protection mathews and tan geng et al however chinas progress in ce im plementation has been modest due to the persistence of many bar riers mathews and tan pesce et al further su et al analyzed ce implementation barriers including lack of in centive schemes for ce projects absence of highend technology towards ce practices complex institutional structures and issues of local administration coordination less nancing options lack of transparency and absence of regionwise customized performance y liu lc wood vg venkatesh et al sustainable production and consumption monitoring system ranta et al discussed barriers includ ing the absence of a holistic vision overemphasis on recycling and underuse of reuse and reduce methods from institutional per spectives liu and bai recognized a gap between awareness about ce practices and its implementation due to structural con textual and cultural issues these issues are unique to organiza tions and regions gedam et al yuan identied that inadequate regulatory environment multiple stakeholder involvement absence of basic data and low level of attention to waste management caused obstruct the ce projects in a signicant way this also appears to be a major issue of production and consumption stages in a recent study zhang et al reported that the key barriers to smart waste management for a ce in china were the lack of regulatory pres sures and the lack of environmental education and culture of envi ronmental protection focusing on the holistic supply chain man agement farooque et al b identied the key barriers to cir cular food supply chains in china were weak environmental reg ulations and enforcement lack of market preferencepressure and lack of collaborationsupport from supply chain actors ex tending this insight ranta et al elucidated and compared the institutional barriers of ce economy in china the us and eu rope the study recognized the difference of the normative be haviour of the chinese environment than other regions and at tribute ce performance in china to its large informal sector and lowlevel regulation with less enforcement on the other hand it argued that the us lacks nationwide stringent regulation support ing ce and europe supports ce with high level sourceseparation activities and clear institutional environment in a specic study with respect to norway jaegar and upadhyay identied product design and production and high startup costs are key bar riers to ce environments in sweden the ce activities show less incentive alignment and lack prot focus eriksson et al johansson and henriksson in addition complexity of pro cedures and high legalregulatory compliance costs appear to be the signicant barriers in europe garcaquevedo et al on other hand china considers recyclables as valuables instead of waste yet their regionspecic ce norms appear to be a potential barrier to ce implementation weak legal enforcement farooque et al b in china has continued despite rapid economic expansion the deteriorating en vironment has undermined the local standard of living chinas en vironmental protection law was updated in including stricter punishments on polluters related initiatives have yielded signi cant results especially in air water and soil pollution however food loss and waste is not a heavy polluting sector so it has been excluded from the environmental protection related laws similarly while chinas circular economy promotion law was amended in there are no provisions on food loss and waste while food loss and waste reduction can contribute to the carbon emission food sector was not included in chinas carbon neutrality strategy the most related law is the antifood waste law issued in april intended to enhance food security however many citizens are not aware of the newly enacted law the nes are not high and the measurements are not clear suggesting there will be weak en forcement agrifood products face unique challenges for transitioning to a ce leite et al overall the food recycling system in china is weak due to poor infrastructure for collection and in adequate treatment facilities unsorted food wastes are mainly sent to landlls only in large cities like shanghai and beijing a small portion of food waste is separated at sources and treated by biochemical processes thi et al in recent years in terest in food waste recycling has been growing wen et al zhang et al advocated the use of waste cooking oil as an energy resource converting food waste to energy is in line with the interest of the government to reduce the demand for petroleum products and natural gas liang and zhang li et al woon and lo proposed the use of gen eral food wastes as a potential resource for generating electricity and city gas in hong kong some agrifood wastes such as potato vines peanut shells wild plants and household wastes are con verted into useful products such as biomass biodiesel and ani mal and sh feed as they are nutrientrich with organic matter ma et al chen et al all these studies on food waste recycling focused on technologies and practices they offer little insights into the related implementation barriers which are cru cial for understanding why they not been commercialized in the domestic market theoretical background the research draws on the combined perspectives of stake holder theory and theory of reasoned actions tra at the rm level to explore the challenges of food waste management the stakeholder theory underscores the responsibility of fullling both internal and external participants expectations freeman in the current context it helps explain the reasons for barriers to sustainable food consumption and production that involve ac tors or stakeholders of varied characteristics and behaviors such as processors wholesalers traders distribution channel partners e retailers and consumers the theory offers deliberations on multi stakeholder engagement and governance that are imperative to the food processing industry and contribute to designing and co creation processes in ensuing sustainability across food chains schrder et al besides it provides normative explanations of why and what ways rms should consider stakeholder views in implementing sustainable and productionconsumption strategies the theory also supports incorporating the stakeholders views for visioning and participatory exercises that lead to decision mak ing within the ce and waste management system vergragt and quist the power of tra is betting to explain the rms readiness for adopting ce principles in waste management fishbein and ajzen the theory helps to nd out the reasons of behavioural attitudes of stakeholders towards particular phe nomenon as it is recognized as the moral responsibility of stake holders sayer lehtokunna et al tra helps to under stand the individual actions and consumption patterns to design policy and promote the sustainable waste management practices integrating ce elements specically it helps to explore the atti tude under the conditions of volitional control and predicts the intentions which explicates willingness or readiness to engage a specic task in environmental sustainability han and kim besides it decodes interactions between barriers of scp focus ing on inter and intra organizational subjective norms which is about the specic behavior under external stakeholders pressure fishbein and ajzen thus it is helpful to study the com mitment and readiness to ce through the tting production and consumption processes barrier study techniques in complex environments effective decisionmaking is highly dependent on the analysis of interdependency between the deci sion variables interacting within the system the dematel tech nique gabus and fontela has become increasingly popular in analyzing those interactions shao et al other relevant multicriteria decisionmaking tools include interpretive structural modelling ism analytic hierarchy process ahp analytic net work process anp and structural equation modelling sem re fer table y liu lc wood vg venkatesh et al sustainable production and consumption table a comparison of dematel with ismahpanpsem dematel ism ahp anp sem dematel uncovers the causal interactions among the variables classifying them into cause and effect groups ism uncovers the contextual interactions among variables based on their driving potential and dependencies ahp does not reveal interdependencies between and among the variables anp uncovers interdependencies between and among the variables it is less accepted for barrier studies due to its complexity sem is mainly used for theoretical development and it requires a large sample size source adopted from venkatesh et al and mangla et al the dematel technique not only establish relationships but also elucidate the overall degree of inuence of the study factors gabus and fontela centered on graph theory the tech nique can accommodate heterogeneous factors li and wan benyoucef et al and does not require a large amount of data it visualizes the causal relationships through the impactrelations map or causaleffect diagram where the techniques differentiate causal and effect groups separately venkatesh et al the dematel technique was judged to be most suitable to address the research questions proposed earlier because it is a good t for uncovering the causal relationships between system variables he et al as mentioned earlier we employed fuzzy de matel an advanced variant of the standard dematel technique to address the inherent vagueness bias and uncertainty in human judgments wu and lee lin there is a wide range of research reports that applied fuzzy logic studies with dematel keskin some of the recent dematel studies in the sustain able production consumption domain include deng et al sivakumar et al bhatia and srivastava kumar and dixit liu et al singhal et al etc summarizing the literature review food waste management is a key challenge in scp the ce concept offers a viable pathway to sustainable food consumption and production by treating wastes as resources for value recovery a wide range of barriers to ce imple mentation have been identied in the extant literature but there is a lack of study of specic barriers in food waste management in china this signicant knowledge gap will be addressed in the fol lowing sections besides dematel technique has not been widely applied in the ce studies although it has been widely used and reported in closedloop or conventional reverse supply chain and energy studies in recent times bykzkan and gleryz elikbilek and tysz methodology the study follows a twostep process the rst step is to elu cidate the barrier list in the second step these barriers are sub jected to fuzzy dematel technique in the following step to draw causaleffect maps the following subsections describe the meth ods in detail finalizing the study barriers based on the recent literature the researchers compiled a list of thirteen barriers to sustainable food consumption and produc tion in china with a focus on value recovery from wastes from a ce perspective the list was reviewed by three senior govern ment ocials who were in charge of municipal waste manage ment and new government initiatives in sustainability four busi ness managers who had responsibilities over supply chain opera tions in food processors and retailers and two scholars in the eld with indepth knowledge of the agrifood sector in china they were asked to comment on the validity of the barriers in the chi nese context and whether any important barrier is missed out a concern was raised that practitioners may have diculty to distin guish several barriers in the initial list because they were regarded as too closely related to each other based on their feedback the thirteen barriers were merged into nine barriers that are distinc tively different from each other for example low margin in value recovery from food waste was considered as intertwined with high collection and transportation cost and therefore they were com bined as cost barrier according to their suggestion a new barrier was added into the list which was lack of benchmarking and rel evant standards in china the resulting nal list of ten barriers is described as follows b weak legal enforcement like many other developing countries china lacks a comprehensive and effective legal sys tem for environmental protection and the enforcement of laws is weak borrello et al govindan and hasanagic li and yu despite chinas ambitious ce vision and current environ mental laws the implementation end enforcement has faced many diculties which are intertwined with resource implications mon itoring mechanisms and potential impacts on business operations and economic development b inadequate infrastructure waste sorting at source is a precondition for maximizing value recovery from food waste wang et al unfortunately most chinese cities do not have adequate infrastructure to support refuse classication in july shanghai the largest city in china started to implement compulsory waste sorting however it is lagging in food waste processing capacities overall there is not enough separated bins for diverse types of garbage and the waste management system is weak in china zhang and wen especially in its less devel oped regions b behavioural barrier most chinese do not have the habit of rubbish sorting due to various cultural and historical reasons they are used to mixing all garbage types and throwing them away altogether for convenience liu et al in addition it is part of the traditional chinese culture for a host to prepareorder more than enough foods which is perceived as a symbol of prosperity many chinese hosts feel embarrassed if their guests nish all the served foods because they feel losing face if their guests do not get enough to eat therefore food waste is commonplace at social events in china b l a c k of investment in advanced equipmenttechnologies value recovery from food loss and waste requires signicant up front investment in advanced equipmenttechnologies lack of nancial resources is widely acknowledged as a barrier to support ce implementation govindan and hasanagic in china food processors and municipal waste management departments often employ contractors to manage waste collection and further pro cessing activities such contractors are often small and medium sized enterprises which do not have a lot of nancial resources to invest in advanced food waste processing equipmenttechnologies b lack of expertise ce is a relatively new concept so there is a lack of expertise to support its implementation kaur et al borrello et al food waste as a biobased resource requires specialized competence and knowledge for value recovery opera y liu lc wood vg venkatesh et al sustainable production and consumption table evaluator demographics evaluator group frequency percentage annual revenue million rmb food processor sales distribution channel supermarket importer and exporter eretailer wholesaler consumer total table evaluator proles evaluator group industry experiences years designation middle level manager ownersenior manager food processor supermarket importer and exporter eretailer wholesaler consumer tions at present there are very limited training courses and study programs in china on ce and sustainable food waste management consequently there is a shortage of expertise for a variety of so phisticated food waste treatment options b lack of crosssector collaboration lack of sup portcollaboration from other sectors can be a serious obstacle to a transition to ce mangla et al because it is often not realistic for a same sector to reuse all its wastes for example some food wastes can be used to produce animal feeds com post or energy but they require substantial initial investments and longterm crosssector collaboration between food waste producerscollectors and potential users to be economically vi able unsurprisingly lack of crosssector collaboration is a barrier which hinders the implementation of ce principles in food waste management b cost barrier there is a low margin in value recovery from food wastes and a high cost for food waste collection and trans portation borrello et al govindan and hasanagic therefore food waste management is not necessarily protable depending on whether the operating costs can be fully offset by the economic gains or not due to cost considerations a waste management business may not want to take certain types of food wastes which have lower economic benets apparently there ex ists a cost barrier to achieving maximum environmental benets by collecting and processing all food wastes b lack of economies of scale there is a lack of the economies of scale in collecting and processing food wastes for value recovery borrello et al govindan and hasanagic sauv et al especially for household food wastes household food waste is spatially dispersed and the amount collectable from each residential community is usually not much such a lack of economies of scale disincentivizes sustainable food waste management for value recovery b lack of environmental education and accountability in the past few decades there was very limited education on envi ronmental protection in china consequently many chinese citi zens have little care or awareness about the environmental im pacts of food loss and waste geng et al in recent years the chinese government stepped up environmental education but the effect of the old mindset is persistent especially among the older generations the current environmental education system fo cuses more on professional education and relatively ignores the nonprofessional education that would inuence daytoday con sumption and businessoriented behavior relating to food wastes tian and wang in addition there is often a lack of account ability for environmental damages except for major environmental disasters b lack of benchmarking and standards there are dicul ties in nding benchmarking enterprises or practices for sustain able food loss and waste management as chinas progress toward a ce is still modest mathews and tan there is also a lack of national and industry standards for collecting and processing food wastes overall food waste management as a sector is still at an early stage of adopting sustainability practices in china the researchers designed a questionnaire in english to cap ture the opinions of evaluators for fuzzy dematel analysis the questionnaire was then translated into the chinese language in cluding an explanation of each barrier to guide the evaluators two researchers who are bilingual in english and chinese checked the translation to ensure accuracy the researchers conducted two rounds of pilot tests with nine expert evaluators to get feedback on the questionnaire design based on their feedback the researchers revised the questionnaire to ensure content validity by eliminating ambiguity and possible confusion the nalized questionnaire was distributed by email or post to be anonymously completed by potential evaluators in three groups food processors food processingmanufacturing compa nies sales and distribution channels supermarkets importexport businesses eretailers and wholesalers and consumers each group had potential evaluators received the questionnaire so in total the questionnaire reached potential evaluators for the evaluators from the industry sectors we employed a purpo sivejudgmental sampling approach saunders et al to target those who are most knowledgeable on the subject we only in vited participations from senior executivesmanagerssupply chain heads and business owners this was to ensure the quality of the data and the validity of the results the data collection was sup ported by three branches of a regional government in northern china namely the development and reform commission the bu reau of commerce and food safety committee for responses from consumers a convenience sampling method was adopted a total of questionnaires were returned from three groups of evalua tors among which complete responses were considered valid for the fuzzy dematel analysis tables and show the prole of these evaluators y liu lc wood vg venkatesh
