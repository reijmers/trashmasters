Packaging waste is one of the  critical problems that is leading to such a situati on and a focus of the U.N. Sustainable  Development Goals.  However, large multinational en terprises look at their products and its  packaging in a separate way, which leads them to th ink that when the product is consumed,  their responsibility ends, leaving the government t o deal with the issue of managing the  packaging waste. Due to the complexity of the issue  and the fact that this is particularly  problematic in emerging markets, we used an in-dept h and longitudinal case study analysis.   We found that there were a desire and ability, with  the use of the right technology, among  urban groups to tackle the problem if with the righ t incentives to the different involved actors  and from a holistic perspective. Our findings allow ed us to advance a holistic framework  based on incentives by using digitalization and new  technologies such as blockchain and  artificial intelligence.  Doing so, we advance the theory in the circular economy by enhancing  it with the use of new technologies and advance a resources value loop that adds to the  product life cycle theory .

Journal Pre-proof Page 2   1. Introduction  The United Nations  has stated that we have rea ched a tipping point as far as the earth’s  capacity to sustain mankind is concerned . Other organizations (e.g.,  European Union, 2019; National Geographic, 2019) ha ve voiced similar concerns pointing to  the fact that the society needs to move away quickl y from certain well entrenched habits. A  case in point is the way that the society deals wit h packaging waste, particularly plastic.   Plastic 1 packaging waste  has an adv erse footprint in terms of  contributing to climate crisis due to the quantity,  volume, and time that it takes to naturally  decompose.  Not surprisingly, many  refer to  packaging waste as one of the major contributors to  the current climate crisis.  However,  packaging is pervasive in our daily lives as it ena bles us to save food, reduce product damage,  improve shelf-life and appearance, lower costs, and  surge convenience.   Thus, we ask: If packaging waste is a critical and systemic probl em in regard to the  climate crisis but at the same time so ubiquitous i n our daily lives, what are the fundamental  and societal changes required to tackle this issue?  Having this research question in mind, the  aim of our study is to elucidate on the societal ap proach required to tackle the issue of  packaging waste by bringing all the different inter venient into a holistic framework based on  an incentives system.  Currently, corporations have a mentality of disting uishing between the product and its  packaging. This, in turn, leads them to think that when the product is consumed, their  responsibility ends leaving the government to deal with the issue of managing the packaging  waste.  We, therefore, see companies exhibiting a d ual or bipolar attitude where they  acknowledge and market the complete product as incl usive of its packaging before the sale  but completely disown their responsibility by disso ciating the packaging from the product                                                              1 Plastic and other slow-decomposing materials.  Journal Pre-proof Page 3   post-consumption.  However, even if this mentality of disowning the packaging waste post- consumption is still very much impregnated in the a ctions displayed by corporations,  consumer expectations regarding the role of corpora tions in dealing with the challenges of  climate change in general, and packaging waste in p articular, are changing.  Societal  awareness to waste in oceans and landfills, for exa mple, is a recent driving force to push for  changes . Images of packaging  waste eliminating precious marine  species, being found inside marine animals, destroy ing fragile flora and fauna, covering  paradisiac beaches, or forming towering waste mount ains, are having an impact on  consumers.  Moreover, NGOs, activists and citizen g roups are demanding that corporations  and governments act in order to take appropriate ac tion against the issue of mounting  packaging waste.  Recently, The Guardian  rep orted that Coca Cola, Nestle, Pepsi, and  other large corporations have been sued by a Califo rnia environmental group for creating  plastic packaging waste.  At the same time, governm ents too are stepping up the pressure on  corporations to take ownership of the waste generat ed by their brands by implementing  increasingly restrictive laws.  A case in point is a recent Solid Waste Management law   in India. This law requires corporation s to institute a system to collect back the  waste generated by their brands.  Nonetheless, and despite these advancements from di fferent stakeholders,  corporations have a low incentive to change their c urrent practices, particularly in low  institutionalized countries.  The apathy of corpora tions to step forward and take charge of  implementing appropriate measures, has resulted in a status–quo of sorts.  However, this  situation can be improved through the use of recent  technology advancements. We believe  that an incentive system along the value chain, cov ering the different stakeholders involved,  might change this situation. Technology advancement s such as blockchains, artificial  intelligence , internet of things , big da ta, robotics, amongst others, might help to  Journal Pre-proof Page 4   close the loop and enable a move away from the curr ent linear to a truly circular economy   on packaging waste.  Since India has the legal framework in place that o bliges corporations to be  responsible for their own packaging waste and is on e of the largest emerging economies  , we investigated the packaging waste problem in this setting and how technology is  being used.  Indeed, EEs have been an important par t of the last two decades’ economic  development.  However, increased production, and th us consumption and the resulting waste,  coupled with the institutional voids  that exist in terms of enabling  institutional capabilities to cope with the quantum  and nature of the packaging waste, are the  ingredients to a potential world environmental disa ster.  Thus, EEs are a good starting point  to tackle the packaging waste problem.  However, we need to understand that tackling this i ssue is complicated on such  resources and capabilities constrained economies. B ecause of that, our research proposes a  defined strategy that focuses on large MNEs due to four main reasons: 1) The impact that  those corporations have on packaging waste on EEs; 2) Their resources and capabilities  available worldwide; 3) Their corporate social resp onsibility and ethics internal strategies;  and 4) Their brand value and how much they have to lose when legitimacy from the different  stakeholders is jeopardized.  Thus, we focused on t hose corporations and on the understating  of how we could align the different stakeholders’ i ncentives towards a packaging CE, so the  system makes environmental and social, but also eco nomic sense.   The integrated waste management approach propagated  by Wilson et al.  and  Seadon  along with the stakeholder theory adv anced by Freeman et al.  provide  the theoretical basis for our framework.  With our framework we provide a practical  approach/model by showing the role of the various s takeholders/agents who are part of the  waste value chain, and how they can make a positive  difference backed by several benefits.  Journal Pre-proof Page 5   With this article we contribute to the increasing l iterature in CE by bringing it to a still  under-studied specific phenomenon – fast moving con sumers good packaging. Moreover, we  bridge CE with new technologies, and thus advance o ur knowledge on how new technologies  can enhance and leverage CE framework and practices . We also contribute to the theoretical  discussion of product life cycle by expanding it to  a resources value loop  as corporations  need to integrate their products with its packaging .  The idea of looking at product and  packaging separately needs to be abandoned.  Finall y, we advance the participatory  theoretical models backed by a framework that demon strate the practical approach that can be  taken to apply the principles of CE at the grassroo ts level. Indeed, these models are yet to be  conceptualized in the context of EEs, even though i ts need is paramount from a world  sustainability perspective.   2. Literature Review  2.1 Stakeholders Theory  In the modern business context, there has been a tr ansference in objectives of organizations  from a focus on profitability of the shareholders a nd the maximization of profits towards the  concern of a more global satisfaction of all stakeh olders, allowing concepts such as corporate  social responsibility  and CE to develop.  Hav ing that in mind, the Stakeholder Theory   argues that the ultimate test for the company would be to successfully  satisfy all the demands of the multiple stakeholder s instead of accomplishing conventional  economic and financial criteria , where stakeholders are “any group or  individual who can affect or is affected by the ach ievement of the organization’s objectives”  . The Stakeholder Theory attem pts to balance the added value and  benefits that the different stakeholders exchange w ith firms .  Furthermore, the  acknowledged importance of the “well-being” of the natural and social environment in which  the companies are inserted leads them to take a str ategic approach to CSR in response to  Journal Pre-proof Page 6   stakeholder demands .  Theref ore, the Stakeholder Theory defends that  the use of a socially responsible strategy to maxim ize business profits is advantageous  .  From a multinational enterprises  perspective , Stakeholder Theory needs to be  framed from both the firm home and host markets as those firms need to pursue legitimacy  also in the host-countries (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983 ; Hah & Freeman, 2013; Jamali, 2010;  Tan & Wang, 2011).  Subsidiaries of MNEs, suffer fr om liability of foreignness as host- country stakeholders often lack information concern ing the subsidiaries and can use  preconceived notions, which negatively affect subsi diaries (Hansen et al., 2020; Campbell et  al., 2012).  Therefore, MNEs need to be particularl y careful when operating in foreigner  markets and analyze carefully the different stakeho lders and their power (D’Souza et al.,  2020; Mitchell et al., 1997).  However, for large M NEs, frequently coming from developed  economies, entering into EEs means a relaxation of CSR and activities .  This happens because consumers and other social gro ups are frequently not seen as a  strong stakeholder as it happens in developed econo mies .   Furthermore, the formal institutions in EEs are wea k (Torres de Oliveira et al., 2020; Oriaifo  et al., 2020), which allows the MNEs to operate wit h less CSR consciousness (Miska et al.,  2016). Packaging of their products is an example of  an activity that MNEs, particularly large  ones, tend to rely on the institutional voids of th e host countries instead of following more  stringent policies as frequently happen at home or other developed economies (Chen et al.,  2016).  This also happens because there is the over all perception, even among large MNEs  that present billions of dollars on financial profi ts very year, that packaging of their product is  out of their responsibility as soon as the product is sold and therefore packaging is someone  else responsibility.  In this research, however, we  bring the MNEs to the center of the  problem but also to the center of the solution and armed with the Stakeholders Theory, we  Journal Pre-proof Page 7   felt the necessity to also bring together the other s MNEs stakeholders to help tackle this  critical problem, particularly to EEs.  2.2 Packaging waste and circular economy  Boulding’s concept of a closed circular earth syste m with finite assimilative capacity and the  resulting requirement for an equilibrium between th e environment and the economy   was a first attempt to describe wh at we today call CE.  Stahel and Reday   developed the concept of the loop economy an d supporting efficiency and  dematerialization industrial strategies. However, i t is Pearce et al.  that are often  credited with introducing the CE concept as they de scribed the influence of natural resources  on the contemporary linear economic system.  In thi s research, we follow the Kirchherr et al.   comprehensive definition of CE and t he different concepts that summarizes all  important aspects of it.   Environmental threats, economic challenges, and unm et social expectations have  resulted in the concept gaining momentum amongst pr actitioners, scholars, and policymakers  .  The CE is now argued to be one of the most notable sustainable  development concepts  as products can be repaired, reused, upgraded or  become a part of a fully recycled system, leading t o furthering environmental, economic, and  social goals .    However, many practices are fundamentally entrenche d in firms’ operations and  business models and once established are often diff icult to adjust .  Also,  political obstacles remain difficult to remove due to the strong influence of lobby groups also  hindering the introduction of externalities policie s. Complex international supply chains and  large up-front investments are holding companies ba ck from transitioning from a linear to a  CE.  Even if we know that CE initiatives had been i ncorporated into the corporate  sustainability agenda of large MNEs , we also know that  Journal Pre-proof Page 8   initiatives addressing consumers are critical for m aking a transition towards CE and those are  still largely missing .  Ind eed, the CE initiatives seem to emphasis on  the design of processes and the cycling of material s but frequently remain silence on the  social dimension inherent to its applicability and sustainable development .    Indeed, the responsibility not only lies with priva te businesses, but also with  regulators and policy makers , an d with the consumers and social  organizations. Credible global, national and region al consumption targets, smart regulation  and incentive structures should consider, guide and  align all stakeholders’ behavior,  encourage innovation and investment, as well as int ernational governmental and professional  cooperation, as well as encouraging transformative systematic change rather than incremental  efficiency gains . Furthermo re, in the advancement of the CE it is  crucial to support EEs to avoid further ‘business m odel lock-ins’.  This is why a holistic view  with the different stakeholders involved is require d.  Indeed, CE implementation is an  example of an organization’s decisions being influe nced by stakeholders’ demands (Cantrell  et al., 2015), and therefore linked to the Stakehol ders Theory.   CE emphasizes the importance of recycling as one of  the means to reduce the  environmental impact of waste, where packaging play s an important role. Because plastics,  for example, generated from packaging has increased  exponentially, there have been several  calls to tackle the issue, namely from European Uni on and United Nations (Eygen, Laner, &  Fellner, 2018).  However, only some packaging mater ials can be recycled or reused (Geueke,  Groh, & Muncke, 2018).  For example, the applicabil ity of plastic waste for a product needs  to be assessed on a case to case basis due to produ ct-specific quality requirements because  the chemical composition of some plastic wastes mig ht hold hazardous substances and  therefore are undesirably for being circulated (Dah lbo, Polaikova, Myllari, Sahimaa, &  Anderson, 2018).  Journal Pre-proof Page 9   Most of the research and efforts in the sustainable  packaging domain has been  conducted in developed economies due to the existen ce of enabling policies (Meherishi,  Narayana, & Ranjani, 2019).  However, EEs are today  important consumer markets and  packing waste generators and where frequently no tr eatment happens. Therefore, tackling the  packaging waste in EEs is critical from a local and  world environmental perspective (de la  Caba et al., 2019).  Furthermore, to design effective packaging waste po licy initiatives, data pertaining to  the flows of the packaging is needed. However, one of the major issues pertaining to  recycling and recovery is that most of the recovery  efforts focus on the downstream portion  or the last mile.  Therefore, closing the loop conn ected to packaging waste depends upon a  variety of factors and the waste collection system deployed by a municipality should be just  one of the factors affecting the overall recycling rates instead of the critical role that today’s  plays.  Other factors that have a bearing are sorti ng and recycling methods, competition  between recycled and virgin materials, price volati lity of recycled materials, waste  management policies, level of education and partici pation, and associated financial incentives  .  Therefore, to try to build a circular packaging was te framework some need to look at  it from a systemic waste management perspective and  acknowledge the necessity of a better  packaging design and technology advancements at the  sorting and recycling stages (Rahimi  & Garcia, 2017).  Furthermore, it is noted that mor e detailed mapping of resource movements  along company and sector value chains is required, as well as analysis on value creations and  economic impact of products and companies, which is  becoming increasingly possible due to  recent technology developments . Indeed, today we have a  group of technological tools available  that can also enhance the  circularity of packaging waste.  Journal Pre-proof Page 10    2.3 Digitalization enhancing the circular economy  Often defined as the increase in the use of digital  technology, digitalization is a process that  generates business change using digital capabilitie s .  This  transformation is characterized by four main aspect s: The “vertical networking of smart  production systems”, “horizontal integration”, “thr ough engineering” and “acceleration  through exponential technologies” .  Fast and strategic utilization of technologies such  as the IoT (fast automated data  transaction and collection through a system of inte rconnected digital devices), AI (data  processing augmentation beyond human reasoning), vi rtual reality (new communication and  experience method), robotics , 3D printing  , sensors , big data (data  processing and interpretation) and blockchain (reco rds linked by cryptography for increased  transparency) amongst others, promises increased co mpetitiveness and reduced operational  risk .  It is widely accepted that digitalization will prom ote the CE by enabling more  efficient use of fewer resources through the provis ion of accurate information and visibility  of resources and products, ultimately resulting in the closure of resource loops.  Enabling the  utilization of intelligence on not only material av ailability, but also its location and condition,  digitalization helps achieve efficiency gains by mi nimizing transaction costs and waste  through the promotion of more durable products .  For example, a move to servitization is considered a crucial CE accelerator, as it  involves the combination of durable physical produc ts with intangible services designed to  fulfil customer needs replacing the generation of p rofit through the sale of artefacts with that  of cost and material efficient reuse.  The utilizat ion of digital technologies, such as cyber  physical systems, big data, data mining and analysi s, IoT, as well as AI, blockchain  Journal Pre-proof Page 11    technology, and smart products have the potential t o allow for improved product design, new  value creation, and the capture of opportunities th at reduce resource use, improve material  transparency, traceability, reliability, and trust within the global value chain, as well as  product performance optimization. Further benefits can be enhancing product innovation,  better attraction of the target customer segment, i mproved technical support provision,  customer satisfaction, ease of collaboration with s takeholders, and higher profit through the  sale of data. Lastly, maintenance and product upgra des could be better planned and targeted,  if product use, and end-of-life activities were opt imized . In short,  CE requires the careful coordination and optimizati on of the entire value chain (Fischer &  Pascucci, 2017) and digital technologies have the p otential to enable decision makers to  comprehend vast amounts of data to make effective, accurate, and sustainable decisions, as  well as to control information and material flows.   However, past literature  explained the  limited research on the opportunities created by, a s well as the challenges hindering, digital  technology-aided circular business model implementa tion.  However, research does suggest  that the main challenges in relation to CE and digi talization are financial (benefit  measurement), structural , operational  , attitud inal (perception of concept and risk,  willingness to collaborate), technological (product  design & operational technology  integration), and educational  .  Thus,  further research is required to determine how barri ers can be overcome theoretically and  practically.   3. U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, Emerging Eco nomies, and Large  Multinationals Responsibility   Journal Pre-proof Page 12    The 2030 agenda for sustainable development publish ed by the United Nations provides a  guide for achieving the goals of peace and prosperi ty for our planet .  At the heart of the blue print are the 17 Sustainab le Development goals which are the clarion  call for all the nations, irrespective of their dev elopmental stage, to collaborate in developing  a partnership in order to pursue economic growth wh ile balancing the issues pertaining to  health, state of our cities, justice, pollution, eq uality and state of the oceans and earth.   Packaging waste is relevant to at least six of thes e goals: Goal No 6: Clean Water &  Sanitation; No 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities ; No 12: Responsible Consumption and  Production; No 13: Climate Action; No 14: Life Belo w Water; and No 15: Life on Land.  If developed economies already have mechanisms in p lace that will allow them to  tackle some of the UN goals , the reality in EEs is very  different .  Indeed, most of t he waste increase is expected to come from  emerging economies  – please ref er to Table 1.  Within the context of  emerging economies, tackling the waste problem is a  bigger challenge in the urban areas  since they are the ‘engines of growth’  but also the ‘agents of change’  .  ***Insert Table 1 around here***  Because of their economic development, countries in  Asia have attracted large  corporations, many of which are large MNEs – please  refer to Table 2. For example,  Hindustan Unilever, the Indian subsidiary of the co nsumer goods major Unilever, is expected  to become the largest subsidiary for the global gia nt Unilever, by surpassing the US unit by  2027 .  Having an annual es timated growth rate of 9%, it is the  fastest among all of the Unilever’s markets. The In dian subsidiary is already the largest  market for Unilever in terms of volume and nearly 4 5 billion units are produced annually at  the company's factories across India and nearly 98 per cent of households in India use one or  Journal Pre-proof Page 13    more Unilever brands.  Similarly, Proctor and Gambl e  India controls over half the  diaper, sanitary napkin and shaving razor market in  India .  Not surprisingly,  large MNEs are responsible for more than 95% of pac kaging waste in countries like India –  please refer to Table 3.  ***Insert Table 2 and 3 around here***  Having in mind the importance of urban spaces on EE s and how much large MNEs  contribute to the packaging waste problem globally,  we focus this research on how these  large MNEs can be agents of change, or at least par ticipants of change, on urban emerging  economies’ settings.  However, due to its complexit y, waste requires an integrated approach  where governments will also be an important stakeho lder.  3.1 Institutional initiatives  Several governments are making a stance on waste. F or example, in 2019 the European  Parliament approved a ban on a wide-ranging list of  single use items 2.  In addition, financial  measures such as offering deposit refund programs h ave been encouraged to ensure collection  of 90% of single-use bottles by 2025.  In India, Pr ime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to stop  the use of single use plastic in India by 2022 and has asked businesses to do their part in  order to accomplish this goal.   However, it was the Indian SWM  law that crea ted a regulation that puts the  onus on the brand owners for collecting their produ cts’ packing waste or packet for sanitary  waste.  Its article 17  reads: “ All manufacturers or brand owners who sell or marke t their  products in such packaging material which are non- biodegradable shall put in place a  system to collect back the packaging waste generate d due to their production” ; and article 17   reads: “ Manufacturers or brand owners or marketing companie s of sanitary napkins and  diapers shall explore the possibility of using all recyclable materials in their products or they                                                              2 Single-use plastic items, including straws, cotton swabs and disposable plastic plates and cutlery, to  be banned  by 2021.   Journal Pre-proof Page 14    shall provide a pouch or wrapper for disposal of ea ch napkin or diapers along with the  packet of their sanitary products.”    This document also articulates the need for busines s firms, communities, and NGOs  to work together with the local municipal authoriti es, in order to deal with the large quantum  and composition of the municipal solid waste.  As a  part of this integrated 3 approach to  managing municipal solid waste, producers have to p ut in place a proper mechanism to take  back the waste caused by their brands if they want to keep operating under the Indian legal  framework.   However, due to the institutional voids present in India, as in many other emerging  economies, large MNEs are able to dodge this becaus e of the lack of coordination between  various local and regional governments, an archaic legal system, minimal use of technology,  absence of data, and a lack of a legal enforceabili ty system.  In one of our interviews a  municipal commissioner in the government of Maharas htra, India, stated:  “It is more than three years since the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 have  been notified. The regulations require companies to  take back their waste but they  don’t do it. We have sent them legal notices but th ey don’t bother to respond to  them. They are not providing pouches for the dispos al of sanitary pads and they  just don’t care about the consequences. The rules d on’t specify the deterrents for  non-compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rule s. We have limited powers  and believe me there are so many challenges that we  have face here…we need to  be empowered and the companies need to get the mess age that they cannot just  come sell and leave us to clean up the mixed waste… .”    Thus, proper implementation of the policy continues  to remain a challenge (Agarwal  et al., 2015).  Large MNEs, on the other hand, foll ow a ‘ not in my backyard ’ attitude, which  exacerbates the problem.  4. Methodology                                                              3 An integrated solid waste management approach adop ts a strategic view by considering the generation, segregation,  transfer, sorting, treatment, recovery, and disposa l of waste in an integrated manner, with an emphasi s on maximizing  efficiency of resource use. The role of the Central,  State, and Local Governments in Municipal Solid Wa ste Management has  been elaborated in the document published by the Mi nistry of Housing and Urban Affairs of the Governme nt of India.  Journal Pre-proof Page 15    Buckley et al.  expressed the importance of p henomena-driven perspective as a way to  address and tackle the big questions and grand chal lenges. Others stressed how qualitative  methods are important for understanding real-world phenomena and for future development,  but also found that outstanding qualitative researc h in top journals was conducted under  single case studies , namely the Tomioka Paper  Company  and the Ikea cas e .  Welch et al.  explained that case studies can  follow different paths. Due to the  problem in hand, a phenomenon that is seemingly dif ferent from past theories and the  available frameworks, in this research we decided t o follow a contextualized explanation  .  This method was particularly rele vant for this research as we knew that we  would be analyzing a dynamic and complex set of mec hanisms that we wanted to deal with  from a holistic perspective. Thus, we followed a de ductive approach by grounding our  observations and theorizations on past theoretical frameworks.   5. Data Collection and Analysis  The topic of this paper is of an exploratory nature , concerns a contemporary and novel  phenomenon, and has the potential for theoretical d evelopment. Therefore, we followed the  literature recommendation to employ an in-depth lon gitudinal case study approach to gain  rich qualitative insights .  Such a qualitative research approach, and particula rly longitudinal case-studies  design, have been advocated for addressing contempo rary or novel phenomena which can  challenge previous theories or models (Eisenhardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007;  Ghauri, 2004; Yin, 2013), particularly because of i ts very nature of being illustrative and  explorative. With this approach we gained an invalu able opportunity to obtain and interpret  rich data and information in order to shed light on  underexplored research areas, as tracing  the experiences of the stakeholders who are part of  the packaging waste chain, such as  Journal Pre-proof Page 16    users/waste generators, collectors, urban governanc e bodies, waste dealers, start-ups working  in waste, management committees of large residentia l societies, researchers, waste landfill  site staff, and corporate managers. From a secondar y data perspective, we also studied the  existing policy guidelines, large urban residential  societies reports and other documents, and  company reports to understand the mechanisms associ ated with the incentives to the different  stakeholders to tackle the packaging waste problem.   4.2 Gathering data  We started gathering data through semi-structured i nterviews .  We selected the number of interviews based on consi derations of theoretical saturation, as  suggested by Glaser and Strauss . More specif ically, we continued our interviews until  the explanations and knowledge obtained from additi onal interviewees were very similar to  the explanations and knowledge already obtained .   This process resulted in 45 interviews, totalizing almost 65 hours, more than 20 video  clips, and over 150 photographs. The interviews wer e conducted from March 2018 to June  2019. Our approach involved interspersing the field  work, which covered various  stakeholders involved in the waste value chain, wit h the views of functional, business, and  policy experts from this field – please refer to Ta bles 4 and 5.  ***Insert Table 4 and 5 around here***  Interviews were conducted both in Hindi, Marathi, a nd English. We decided not to  edit the interview transcripts   and to use direct quotes when the interviewees resp onded in English to avoid the risk of  altering the meaning of their explanations. We furt her ensured verbatim translations from  Hindi and Marathi into English in order to keep the  meaning of the conveyed explanations.  In addition to the interviews, there were several o bservations conducted by two of the  authors on different settings such as the process o f doorstep waste collection in urban  Journal Pre-proof Page 17    residential societies, segregation/aggregation of p ackaging waste, transport by the municipal  authorities to the landfill for further processing,  among others. The authors also spent a large  amount of time in scrap sheds understanding and obs erving the waste segregation and sale  process and speaking to municipal officials to unde rstand the challenges with regards to  waste management implantation.  Apart from this in-depth longitudinal work, we coll ected secondary data and  information through company reports, websites, urba n residential societies reports, news  media, and reports and publications from the United  Nations on the SDGs 4, Indian  regulations, among others.  4.3 Data Analysis  The main technique of data analysis used was templa te analysis, even to have a methodical  structure of the gathered data and information . We selected the computerized  analysis software NVivo, which aided us in analyzin g the complex and large quantity of  collected data and information. Due to the large ab undance of information from our cases, we  needed the triangulations of primary and secondary data sources, as suggested by Ghauri  , to avoiding common-source biases and anecdo tal accounts.  Given the exploratory  nature of the topic, we designed our semi-structure d interviews in a way to allow ample time  for open-ended questions that aided us in exploring  new knowledge and information and  incorporating these in subsequent interviews.   5. The cases  Municipal Solid Waste in India   For the purpose of this paper, we have chosen to ex plain the answers to our research  questions against the backdrop of the waste generat ed in the urban Indian household context  by particularly looking at large confined residenti al compounds, also called residential                                                              4 For example: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org /?menu=1300  Journal Pre-proof Page 18    cooperatives housing societies .  India is am ong the top 10 countries in the world  generating the highest amount of municipal solid wa ste.  In 2019, India alone generated  around 62 million tons of solid waste and this numb er is expected to increase to 165 million  tons by 2030 . About  70-75% of this waste remains  untreated  and is mostly dum ped into landfills.    Our fieldwork was carried out in the Pimple Saudaga r area of Pune, India. The city is  the second biggest city of the state of Maharashtra .  There are two municipal corporations  which are operational in Pune, namely the Pune Muni cipal Corporation  and the  Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation . Our fieldwork was conducted in  the latter area because there are many large housin g society clusters and due to its fast growth  that relates to the availability of information tec hnology  jobs. This, in turn, has attracted  a large number of educated individuals and led to t he creation of cosmopolitan communities  that are relatively more open to experimenting with  IT prototypes and are savvy with using  various mobile applications and tools.  Past literature in the domain of waste management ( Marello & Helwege, 2018; Zhang  et al., 2010) has highlighted the challenges and th e limitations faced by the administrative  machinery, and the case of the municipality under s tudy is no different. The Pimpri Corp  generates about 750 tons of garbage waste and in 20 15 spent nearly USD 1.3 million for  distributing garbage bins  to arou nd 480 thousand families for segregating  the wet and dry garbage .  The Pimpri C orp has spent close to USD 32.5 million  in waste management for the period 2008-2017. This expenditure is expected to go up to  USD 92 million for the period 2018-2026.  Following the SWM  law, Pimpri Corp made it m andatory for their residents to  segregate garbage into dry, wet, hazardous, and ele ctronic waste. This waste segregation  initiative was launched on June 5, 2017, which was designated as the World Environment  Journal Pre-proof Page 19    Day by the Commissioner of the Primpri Corp area.  The move was prompted by the fact that  Pimpri Corp slipped to 72 nd  position, in its Swachh Bharat ranking in 2017.  From a municipality perspective, they started tackl ing this problem by looking at  RCHS due to their large number of residents. Follow ing the government movement, and  given the magnitude of the problem, we decided to i nvestigate RCHS within the Pimpri Corp  catchment.   5.1 Case Study 1:   Roseland Residency Cooperative Housing Society  One of the places that Pimpri Corp picked to launch  their waste segregation initiative in 2017  was the Roseland Residency Cooperative Housing Soci ety . Roseland  RCHS is among the oldest and biggest residential so cieties in the area. There are 37 buildings  in the society and it has approximately 1,200 apart ments, which house about 4,000 residents.  Following the initiative from the local movement, t he Roseland RCHS took several  actions. First, it started garbage segregation and electronic waste management. Garbage is  segregated by the residents into three categories: organic, recyclable , and reject  sanitary waste - achieving nearly 70-80% segregatio n at source – see Figure 1. The  segregation and composting efforts have not only he lped the society to earn awards like the  Prime Minister National Swacch Bharat Award , but have also enabled the society to sell the  compost and generate revenue. The compost is primar ily used for gardening. Second, it  started a water conservation program by rationing w ater supply during the peak summer  months, collecting rainwater for harvesting, and a conscious ban on using tanker water.  The  main and only source of water supply until 2016 was  the borewells situated on the campus.   A third initiative was related to bird feeders. The re are bird feeders and water dispensers  installed throughout the society. This has helped t o revive the declining sparrow/bird  population. Fourth, the society enhanced a power sa vings scheme by switching to LED lights,  Journal Pre-proof Page 20    which helped towards achieving power and carbon red uction targets.  As a result of the  management of the RCHS, the temperature inside the society is nearly two degrees cooler  than outside. Fifth, the society installed a sewage  treatment plant.  The water that is used by  the residents is treated and reused for gardening. Sixth, the society installed solar power  panels to generate renewable power within the compl ex. This will also help them save money  in diesel costs for powering the electric generator .  Other initiatives conducted by the Roseland RCHS we re related to reducing waste.  For example, over the course of the past three year s it created a partnering for social causes  initiative where the society organized clothes coll ection for unfavorable communities such as  GOONJ 5.  The society also created a material recovery fac ility area where residents are  encouraged to drop-off the hard to recycle items su ch as glass, broken bulbs and tube lights,  clothes, plastic bottles, among others.  Various re cycling companies collect these items for  onward processing.  Finally, the society tries to b ring the young generations into the waste  management problem by creating a children’s army of  ‘Plastic Warriors’ to collect the plastic  waste from households and send it onward for recycl ing – see Figure 2.   As one of the householders said: “ There are a lot of initiatives that our society has   undertaken towards environment and social sustainab ility and it’s really a nice place to live.  Even after nearly 12 years, our residential complex  is among the cleanest and safest places to  live. We have revived the sparrow and have got many  awards over the years. In fact, it is  easy to sell an apartment in this society because s o many people want to buy an apartment  here .”  ***Insert Figure 1 and 2 around here***  5.2 Case Study 2:    Kunal Icon Cooperative Housing Society                                                               5 https://goonj.org/page_id=22873/index.html  Journal Pre-proof Page 21    Kunal Icon Cooperative Housing Society   is spread over 76,891 square meters  space and has a total of 873 apartments and houses.  There are approximately 4,000 residents  in the complex. They are located in close proximity  to the Roseland RCHS.  The push for  undertaking segregation of waste was spurred due to  the Pimpri Corp directive to manage  waste and from the election of a new management com mittee that was keen to support Prime  Minister Modi’s initiative called ‘Swachh Bharat Ab hiyan’ 6. The Kunal RCHS has  undertaken similar approaches to sustainable living  approach when compared with Roseland  RCHS.  Kunal RCHS also used rainwater for harvestin g, which helped the society to remain  water sufficient from July to November every year a s compared to other residential  complexes in the municipality area, which have to d epend upon water trucks ferrying water.  The society also has solar power generation to redu ce the dependence upon the power grid.   This activity also qualifies for earning credits re quired in order to get a property tax waiver.  The Kunal RCHS has also been involved in tree plant ation activity in order to keep the  campus verdant, even to qualify towards earning poi nts that are reverted in property tax  credits. A material recovery center was also set-up  for the purpose of collecting plastic,  cardboard, papers, and electronic waste.  Interesti ngly, the Kunal RCHS included a  disposable sanitary pads incinerator to prevent soi led sanitary waste from leaving the campus.  This also prevented waste workers from coming in co ntact with such items, and to reduce the  possibility of further contamination.  In this society, compost preparation from the food waste and scraps was done in- house. The food waste  was collected fro m each building and thereafter weighed  using a digital scale. A shredding machine was used  to shred the food scraps into smaller  particles and thereafter natural composting techniq ues were used, wherein microbial culture  along with an assortment of Indian herbal plant tre atments was applied to the mixture placed                                                              6 Swachh Bharat Abhiyan : Clean India Mission  see http://swachhbharaturban.gov.in/ fo r the  details of the clean India mission urban.  Journal Pre-proof Page 22    in composting pits . The task of d oorstep collection of food and recyclable  waste, incineration of soiled sanitary napkins and compost preparation was handled by three  different vendors.  6. Findings  Based upon our fieldwork on these two residential s ocieties, which are similar to many others  all over India, and after talking to different stak eholders we found some commonalities.   First, we found that there is a desire and ability among communities to find solutions to the  mammoth problem of managing waste.  As the Chairper son of the Roseland RCHS put it:  “We want this to be a great place for people to liv e and raise families. Therefore,  we know that it is up to us to keep this place clea n and livable. We just have to  step out the precincts of our gates to see the cont rast between the cleanliness and  hygiene standards that we have maintained in our re sidential complex versus  what is available outside. We also involve our kids  in understanding the need to  segregate household waste properly, so that this ha bit is imbibed in them right  from a very young age. This is our country and it’s  our moral and civic duty.”    However, these intentions were linked with institut ional support. For example, it was  interesting to realize that instead of reprimand me asurements, the municipality decided to  incentivize RCHS and compounds in waste segregation  and other sustainability initiatives,  namely by introducing tax waivers 7.  Moreover, and in order to encourage community  participation in eco-friendly activities, particula rly waste segregation, the municipality also  introduced an innovative program to offer a waiver on the property tax for its residents based  upon on several criteria – please refer to Table 6.   ***Insert Table 6 around here***  We also found that monetary incentives such as prop erty tax breaks introduced by the  municipalities and presence of other incentives suc h as public recognition among peers  helped to secure a “buy-in” and hasten the transiti on from a ‘ not my problem’  to a ‘our  community problem ’ as the community started participating in segrega tion to a point where it                                                              7 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/prop erty-tax-waiver-for-eco-friendly- societies/articleshow/60771357.cms  Journal Pre-proof Page 23    is segregating nearly 85% of their solid waste.  Fu rthermore, we found that the initial stages  of building awareness, overcoming resistance and co nvincing residents is very tough.  However, the RCHS created the ‘waste champions’ as they knew that attitudinal change is a  long process that can result in a lot of friction.  Some of the society’s managing committee  members explained that it is only after receiving a ccolades and success that things become a  bit easier. As a committee member said: “ It would helpful to have a forum wherein such work  is recognized so as to motivate more waste champion s to come and take the work forward in  their respective communities.”   The same managers explained that there are genera lly one or  two persons who are spearheading the task of awaren ess building, overcoming any resistance,  and ensuring that the segregation continues on a da ily basis.   Another finding from our field work relates to the various innovations that occur at  the grassroots level, especially while managing the  entire activity on a limited budget and in  the midst of a skeptical audience. This can be in t he form of design of the structures,  equipment, and processes. In both of the above soci eties, the group driving the waste  segregation initiative had produced design innovati on pertaining to the compost pits, marking  of sanitary waste, rainwater harvesting methods use d, and the push carts prepared for  collecting the waste at the door-step level.  Inter esting, however, is the extent of the usage of  social media for publicizing the initiatives taken 8 as it was different between the two  residential societies.   Nonetheless, with these palpable achievements, not everything went smoothly on this  transition to a more sustainable residential societ y. The indifference regarding the inability of  the existing municipal machinery to cope with the v olume of waste, namely packaging one,  and the lack of awareness regarding the harmful eff ects of items such as used sanitary                                                              8 See Roseland Residency Cooperative Housing Society ’s website here :  https://www.facebook.com/roselandresidency4 and Kun al Icon’s Waste Warriors here :  https://www.facebook.com/groups/Kunaliconwastewarri ers/  Journal Pre-proof Page 24    products were challenges.  Moreover, marketing the compost made from the food waste was  a challenge faced by both residential societies. In  the absence of suitable sales avenues, this  resulted in the stockpile of the compost inventory causing space problems.  The managing  committee member who is in charge of the waste mana gement project in Kunal RCHS said:  We are meticulous in segregating the food   waste and preparing  compost by following the aerobic method. We spend a bout USD 785 per month  for offering door step waste collection facility to  our residents and our capex cost  for constructing the compost pits, procuring materi als, labor, etc. for constructing  5 compost pits was about USD 1 200.  In fact, our c ompost is of a very good  quality but it is difficult to market the same. As a result, it piles up and occupies a  lot of space…marketing linkages for the compost sho uld be developed.    Our interviews also pointed to the fact that both R CHSs were interested in partnering  with the municipality and commerce companies in con ceptualizing/implementing solutions  that involved minimizing waste or enabling efficien t collection of the waste generated by  brands. In the case of Roseland RCHS, for example, they had volunteered to be part of an  exercise to test market a new product design for sa nitary napkins and diapers by the leading  brand leader in this space.  The Chairperson of the  Roseland RCHS said:  “Since we are a community of approximately 4,000 pe ople, we get a lot of  packages ordered via the ecommerce websites. Anothe r contributing factor is that  since most of our residents are people working in t he IT space, they are  comfortable in using the internet for their purchas es. During promotional events  conducted by the ecommerce companies, such as mega sales and festival  promotional offers, we get a lot of packages that a re discarded as waste. Quite a  lot of these packages can be reused, but since ther e is no incentive to hold on  these packages, people just throw them. We are will ing to work with ecommerce  players in order to contain this waste. We can set aside some additional space in  our premises for the recovery of the resource such as good sturdy cardboard  boxes, plastic covers etc. which can be reused. In one location itself the  ecommerce company can get back what would otherwise  be treated as waste –  and convert it into an item that can be used to ser vice the next order and so  forth.”    6.1 Use of Technology:  Both the residential societies used a semi-automate d approach for their administration  purposes.  In the case of Roseland RCHS, usage of t echnology has evolved with the passage  Journal Pre-proof Page 25    of time and increase in the number of residents.  I n the time period 2009-2011, the main  medium of communication was the email. A Gmail grou p was created for information  exchange purposes. Further, a Facebook page was als o created 9.  Subsequently, a WhatsApp  group was created, and the e mail account was disco ntinued.  Roseland RCHS uses the  ADDA software for managing its administrative activ ities.  External reports to be submitted  to government authorities are prepared using a comb ination of MS office tools along with the  ADDA software.  Roseland RCHS also has its own webs ite.  Kunal RCHS, on the other hand, uses the Tally softw are for its accounting purposes.  Vendor bills are received either via email or throu gh a physical copy and paid by updating the  relevant expense head in Tally.  Unlike Roseland RC HS, which does not track its organic  waste to compost data, Kunal RCHS maintains daily r ecords of the organic   collected from each building as well as the amount of compost harvested every month. This  data is maintained in excel and detailed records ar e kept of the quantity harvested, sold, and  price sold. They also use WhatsApp for communicatio n and have created a group on  Facebook called the ‘Kunal Icon Waste Warriors’10  to discuss the concerns and challenges  related to waste management in the society. Kunal R CHS also has a website 11 .  Both the  residential societies also use You Tube for posting  videos that highlight their sustainability  initiatives, and celebrations 12 .  The managing committee members and the residents  of both  these RCHS are cognizant of the power of the visual  medium in spreading the word regarding  their work by providing a visual documentation to g overnment officials, prospective buyers  and corporate sponsors, and the media.  It also see ms that the residents are open to try new  things as one of the residents stated: “…there are still many things that we can do to red uce                                                              9 see https://www.facebook.com/roselandresidency4  10  https://www.facebook.com/groups/Kunaliconwastewarr iers/  11  http://www.kunalicon.com/home  12  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rosel and+residency and  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kunal+ icon  Journal Pre-proof Page 26    the waste generation. We are about 4,000 people so even small steps can make a huge  difference. Our society is always ready to try out new initiatives .”  During the course of the data collection in Kunal R CHS, one of the authors piloted the  idea of developing an app for capturing the househo ld related waste segregation pattern and  behavior.  A functional document was prepared after  studying the daily waste segregation  behavior.  The application has been conceptualized with the purpose of gathering user level  ‘first mile’ data of which there is a great paucity  in the present context. Availability of the  first mile data  can help to reward  good behavior through appropriate recognition and r eward in a data driven manner.  7. Discussion  Packaging waste management is a complex issue in an y setting. However, packaging waste  management in low institutionalized countries, such  as emerging economies, is even more  complex due to the institutional voids that are pre sent.  Notwithstanding this, some countries,  such as India, have in place laws and regulation th at require and push the agenda for a CE on  packaging. A case in point is the SWM  law in  India as previously mentioned.  With this research we start to uncover the black bo x that brands created around the  divorce between products and packaging. Brands, and  particularly large MNEs of fast- moving consumer goods, need to rethink the way they  look at their product as consumers will  more and more follow an integrative approach where packaging is part of the product.  This  approach is also in the government’s and individual ’s interest.  However, and due to the resource constraints and ot her limitations, the enforceability  of such regulations is not effective, leaving brand s to operate on a linear economy (Ferreira et  al., 2014; Huysman et al., 2017).  However, and hav ing in mind the stakeholders theory and a  CE approach, combined with some of the features off ered by some emerging technologies,  we believe that the right systems with the right in centives can help in alleviating the situation  Journal Pre-proof Page 27    by enabling better tracking, higher participation b y the stakeholders, better governance of  waste, and enabling opportunities that can help to harness the efficiency of recycling  packaging waste.  In our framework some of the emer ging technologies like mobile  applications, geographical information systems , AI, and blockchain act as catalysts to  enable the implantation of an incentives stakeholde r approach towards a CE.  7.1 The incentives  Past literature  explai ns that apart from conducive policies and  governance and product design, the other critical e lements of the CE is the ability to have  business models that focus on value creation, rathe r than booking short term gains, to the  different shareholders and that incorporate the ext ended producer responsibility guidelines.   Thus, a truly integrated approach towards moving to  a CE requires participation from all the  major stakeholders. It is only then that it is poss ible to move towards an economy that is  restorative and regenerative by design .  To do so, more than a system  based on penalties, which tend to not work on low i nstitutionalized countries (Torres de  Oliveira & Rottig, 2018), we suggest a business mod el that incentivize the different main  stakeholders involved.   Thus, an aligned incentives schemes needs to be in place for the primary stakeholders  involved: Large MNEs, local authorities, residentia l societies , and  individuals. Therefore, we start by explaining the incentives for each of the primary  stakeholders.   As our cases demonstrated, individuals and RCHS can  be easily incentivized by tax  relief. Thus, the residents living in large RCHS ha ve the incentives to qualify for any  incentive programs being administered by the govern ment agencies. Apart from that,  residents will want to have cost savings due to bei ng able to purchase refills of various items  that are package free, benefit from higher visibili ty and potentially quicker sales of their  Journal Pre-proof Page 28    properties, and possible tie-ups with companies who  are interested in partnering for  undertaking CSR policies, which can potentially lea d to financial benefits.   During our fieldwork we found that our studied RCHS , apart from the tax incentives,  emerged as pioneers in adopting sustainability prac tices and got noticed either through social  media and other media channels. This entailed benef its such as: a) quick turnover of the  residential units put on sale as there was a keen i nterest in buyers to acquire a property in  such ‘visionary clusters’, hence residents found co mmunities like Roseland or Kunal RCHS  to have similarity to western initiatives among cit izens to adopt sustainability practices; b) the  spirit of the residents to work together in order t o solve basic needs issues such as availability  of drinking water and maintenance of public spaces,  which meant that most of the residents  knew each other and instances of crimes like theft and robbery were virtually absent; c) these  RCHS were seen as ‘leaders’, which brought good wil l.  These best practices, interestingly,  spurred on many other surrounding RCHS that, in tur n, have resulted in an atmosphere of  healthy competition and quicker speed of adoption, which is also beneficial to the  municipality, environment, and the population in ge neral.  If the local government will be losing revenues due  to the tax incentives, it will be  recovering it through lower waste management requir ed and also because informal economy  will be reduced, namely from waste pickers and wast e collectors.  Urban local bodies spent  between USD7- USD14 per ton on solid waste manageme nt  whereas the  collection & transportation of waste constitutes ap proximately 80-95% of the total budget  allocated for municipal solid waste management . So, the potential  financial benefits are indeed high.  The local gove rnments have, thus, several incentives that  range from less waste to management, decrease of th e informal economy, not being  accountable for not enforcing the SWM  legisl ation, among others.  Journal Pre-proof Page 29    However, to close the loop it is necessary to inclu de large MNEs, owners of the most  important brands used on emerging economies. At the  moment, their incentive to take care of  their packaging is very reduced and almost only eth ical, as these corporations take advantage  on the lack of the legal enforceability in emerging  economies, where India is a case in point  . As these large MNEs are origina lly from developed economies they  should understand that their base home country cons umers have high expectation in terms of  CSR behavior, which include packaging waste.  Moreo ver, host country consumers, namely  from emerging economies, are also becoming more awa re of the impact of these large MNEs  and how they are impacting their lands . Thus, large MNEs need to rethink  and be the agents of change towards close the cycle  of waste and even to ensure a sustainable  approach in their local business practices and thus  to ensure the firms’ existence in the long  run.  The perception that consumers have of the firm’s  operations and ethical behavior is  paramount  and this is in it self the firm’s main motivation to do  what is right and within the legal framework, even if such framework is not enforced.     Institutions can use, for example, their roles as p romoters or detractors of large  corporations based on their legal and moral behavio r. From a moral perspective, researchers  stress the need for an increased role of corporatio ns in solving the challenges that affect the  society, environment and economy .  A  negative message issued from a local or regional go vernment in an emerging economy  towards a global MNE can easily and quickly spread around the globe with huge impacts on  their image, reputations, and client base.  The local governments can also incentivize the larg e MNEs instead of following a  punitive system. For example, quicker turnaround ti mes and discounts on the renewal fees for  state licenses, publishing the success stories via the internet and even promoting, for free,  best practices from large MNEs.  Furthermore, large  MNEs could start saving financial  Journal Pre-proof Page 30    resources by applying a package-free refills approa ch.  Initiatives to opt for package-free  refills can be rewarded based upon the cost of the packaging saved, when compared to the  actual purchase plus the environment benefit that c an be translated in wellbeing. A case in  point is soap and shampoos: customers can bring the ir own refill containers and avail of a  monetary discount.  If this practice might not be f easible for developed economies, the  business model literature pointed to how effective small financial benefits and costs are in  emerging economies .  In summary, the main incentives for the large MNEs to adopt a CE approach for their  packaging are: 1) Remain within the legal framework  that will become more stringent around  the different settings; 2) Fulfil their sustainabil ity commitments, namely in terms of carbon  emissions and waste footprint; 3) Follow their CSR framework by doing what is ethical and  responsible for the society and the environment; 4)  Follow what their different stakeholders  are demanding in terms of packaging; and 5) Make su re that they do not deceive customers’  expectations, as it seems that is already happening :  “…so many things are possible but the companies  don’t want to think outside the  box. They will spend millions of Indian Rupees in a dvertising expenditure but don’t want to  do anything at the grassroots…all this CSR is just a farce because there is nothing that they  are doing in cases where there is so much scope to make a difference…”  - Roseland resident.  8. Rethinking packaging waste: Towards a circular e conomy framework using  emerging technologies  From an institutional perspective, current policies  are still focused on waste management  while in the CE the very idea of ‘waste’ is conside red redundant. Waste from one process  becomes the input for other products and the produc ts are designed to prevent waste. Waste  management policies and product development policie s become linked to each other,  resulting in the creation of policies and activitie s that enable circular flows. We suggest  Journal Pre-proof Page 31    closing this policy-implementation gap by means of a CE framework that incorporates a  community led, data driven approach to facilitate g overnance and establish accountability.   Having that in mind, we developed a CE framework th at makes use of emerging  technologies, namely blockchain, mobile application s, GIS, and AI.  Doing so, this  framework has the intention to promote sustainable communities and close policy gap  implementations, which is particularly important fo r EEs .  Our framework shows  a mo del wherein some of the  emerging technologies have been applied to achieve accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and  accountability among the various stakeholders with respect to managing packaging waste.   An important part of our framework is the tax incen tives in place towards RCHS and  residents and at the same time the focus on large M NEs on taking care of their waste.  Thus,  our framework was created with a sustainability fun d in mind, which is funded by a group of  large MNEs.    ***Insert Figure 3 around here***  In order to control the quality of segregation as w ell as get details of the composition  of the recyclable waste, a mobile app with AI techn ology can be used to determine data about  a) brand; b) brand owner/manufacturer; c) type of p ackaging material; d) number of pieces of  the same package present in the dustbin of the resp ective household; e) size of the package; f)  weight; g) whether there is any dry waste  mixed in the wet waste (food  waste bin); h) whether the waste was segregated int o 3 categories or fractions as required; i)  whether the waste was handed over for further proce ssing to the waste picker in a timely  manner; and j) and other miscellaneous information,  depending upon the level of detail  required.  In case there is a default by the househ older on any of the activities listed above, an  SMS can be sent to him/her for information and corr ective action. A system of decreasing  incentives can be instituted to prevent repeat laps es.   Journal Pre-proof Page 32    On the other hand, local authorities need to have c ontrol systems in place to proceed  with the incentives. This control can be done in se veral ways, but blockchains can be an  extremely handy solution.  The rationale for recomm ending blockchain is that according to  past literature it is recommended when: i) the tran sactions currently involve multiple parties  and require not only the assurance of an intermedia ry, but also a precise and immutable  record of transactions ; ii) have potentially competing incentives  ; iii) retroactive manipulation of d ata is a risk , iv)  multiple uses of the same asset are very likely , and v) no central  trusted authority is available/wanted .  In such scenarios,  blockchain offers a disintermediation solution when  all the intervenient will be able to be  used in a traceable and transparent way.  The data for each household will be updated in a  database that can be mounted on a blockchain in ord er to prevent data tampering.    In our framework, the physical waste can be sold to  waste dealers and the details can  be updated on the same database. The physical recon ciliation (i.e., the actual pieces sold  versus digital reconciliation, which represents the  quantities updated via the mobile app) can  be used for verification.  It is possible to do an audit of the physical and digital categories.  Conducting a physical waste audit can also be anoth er method of cross checking the data and  its veracity. Using the features of the blockchain technology, it is possible to track the onward  journey of the packaging waste, to ensure that it i s disposed of in a suitable manner and not  discarded in an unscientific manner. This ability t o track the entire journey of the waste right  from the first mile  to the poin t of disposal  is possible due to the  power of an integrated approach involving all stake holders.   The access to the audit trail of the transactions c an enable various stakeholders to  verify the authenticity. Based upon the quantum of recyclable waste processed and managed  in-house by large RCHS, a daily update of the funds  due to them by the manufacturers/brand  Journal Pre-proof Page 33    owners can be available. Physical funds can then be  transferred on a pre-specified frequency.  For waste that cannot be categorized or attributed to a manufacturer (small chance given that  AI has the capability to work with large datasets) such items can be charged to a ‘Suspense  Account’.   Every brand owner/manufacturer should be required t o contribute to the sustainability  fund in proportion to their market share and a smal ler fee into a Suspense Account. The  existence of a separate Suspense Account will also help to isolate and track such cases in  detail.   This data based approach can also encourage corpora tions to think of integrating  principles of CE approach in their business strateg ies as they may find it more profitable to  manufacture products that last longer, offer repair  and refurbishing services to extend the life  of some of their products, or consider package free  options like refills of certain items. The  thick arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of fu nds while the thin arrows indicate the  process flows. The non-linear thick arrows indicate  that the data generated can be used to  create a sustainability map, which can help to diss eminate the performance of the various  housing communities.  The contribution into the fund can be made by using  the market share data/sales data  reported in the statutory filings of these companie s.  Housing communities that are  undertaking the task that is actually the responsib ility of these large MNEs should be  compensated based on the amount that is recycled. T he work done at the housing society  level can be certified by an independent audit comm ittee.  This committee can comprise  people from diverse skill sets such as social scien tists, environment experts, policy experts,  NGO’s, students, government representatives, and wa ste workers. Smart contracts can be  used to execute the payments from the sustainabilit y fund into the accounts of the cooperative  housing society . The back end  of the data can be mounted on blockchain  Journal Pre-proof Page 34    to keep traceability. For the purpose of explaining  the mechanics of the operation of a  sustainability fund, we have used the data from a r ecent waste audit report published by  GAIA 13  . This waste audit exercise was undertaken in 2018,  across 15 cities of India.  Volunteers collected 46,100 different packaging was te items to gather evidence about the  situation at the grassroots level. This is presente d in tables 7.   ***Insert Table 7 around here***  Having an arrangement wherein waste pickers are abl e to collect and segregate the  waste within the precincts/in close vicinity of a l arge residential cluster, such as RCHS, can  help them earn a livelihood that is based on a fair  wage and work in relatively good working  conditions. This approach can also help the waste w orkers get a fair compensation for their  efforts and earn their livelihoods in a suitable se tting instead of operating from the roadside  makeshift segregation points, located in unsafe are as/spaces from where they operate to  escape harassment and abuse.   Furthermore, local authorities can create digital o pen source solutions to promote the  sharing of the principles of CE via a web map.  The  idea is to use this web map as a means of  communication to help in transmitting the best prac tices and aid in monitoring the  sustainability practices being followed by differen t clusters by publishing a ‘Sustainability  Index’.  Different clusters based upon their effort s over a period of time, can have different  indices that can be shown in different colors, whic h incentivize a healthy competition.  The  key is to use technology as a medium for motivating  pro-active behavior in a transparent  manner. Another option is to use community GIS plat forms using spatial data infrastructure.  9. Conclusions and implications  Apart from the implications to practice and policie s, our research advances theory in three  main ways. First, we brought the CE framework to a still under-studied specific phenomenon                                                              13  https://www.no-burn.org/india-brand-audit-2018/   Journal Pre-proof Page 35    – fast moving consumer goods packaging. This is par ticularly important due to the paramount  problem that plastic wasting has in the world .  Second, we advance  the CE by integrating it with new technologies, and  thus advance our knowledge on how new  technologies can enhance and leverage CE framework and practices. If past research started  to uncover how new technologies might be used on a CE framework (e.g., Bressanelli et al.,  2018; Heyes et al., 2018), our manuscript gives spe cific application on how this can be used  in practice. Finally, we contribute to the theoreti cal discussion of product life cycle (Klepper,  1996) by expanding it to a resources value loop.  Up to now, the literature on product life  cycle focused on the tangible asset that is consume d .  However, we  challenge this premise as the packaging and its was te, can have, at least, a similar impact on  consumers when compared to the products. Such impac t has the potential to impact a firm’s  financial sustainability in the long term, which re quires the firm to change its business model  to accommodate the packaging and its treatment. By advancing a participatory theoretical  model backed by a framework that demonstrate the pr actical approach that can be taken to  apply the principles of CE at the grassroots level,  we conceptualize how a resources value  loop can exist.  10. Limitations and future research  As with any other, this research has several limita tions. A main limitation of our work is its  settings. Our approach is particularly relevant to EEs where large MNEs have a large impact  on packaging waste and where large residential soci eties/compounds exist. All of these  conditions are not always present and thus our fram ework has associated boundary  conditions.  However, it seems that large EEs follo w similar situations to the ones that we  studied, which allows us to think that our framewor k has the potential to impact a large  percentage of packaging waste.  Journal Pre-proof Page 36    On the other hand, this research opens several aven ues for future research. A topic  related with products packaging relates to the pack aging of online purchases.  Future studies  can try to unpack how web-commerce can follow a CE.   As one of the Roseland residents  said: “There is so much unnecessary packaging waste that is a part of any online order from  the popular ecommerce stores like say Amazon, Flipk art, Myntra or other such similar sites. I  mean even if I order a garment it is wrapped again in bubble wrap, there is a cardboard box,  plastic air pillows for one such item which is not even going to break! Why do we need all  this extra packaging? I mean think about it – for c lothes, bed sheets, sports shoes, belts, bags,  combs, books, etc. There are so many more items tha t we can think of where we don’t need  all this extra packaging. The government needs to f ine these folks. So much unnecessary  packaging cost, transport cost, why? What is Jeff B ezos thinking?”   Another topic that our research uncovered relates t o the use of new technologies. Even  if we used some of the recent advances in terms of new technologies, there are many other  technologies that have the potential to be used and  thus open new avenues of research. A case  in point is augmented reality or the IoT, which mig ht have the potential to overcome some of  the current limitations.
