of debate in sci entic and nonscientic circles Kalmykova et al Kirchherr et al Laurenti et al SurezEiroa et al The conceptual approach of circularity has opened different interpreta tions understandings and thoughts to complement the economic and business orientation for industries that are aimed at the con tinual use of resources while eliminating waste Foundation One challenge is to embed socioeconomic practices in CE initiatives at city levels Kirchherr et al Laurenti et al SurezEiroa et al Many cities are pushed to restructure their household solid waste HSW management systems to a circular view Ghosh and Agamuthu Haupt et al European legislation for example claims phasing out the disposal of recyclable HSW eg paper plastic glass metal preventing its generation andortransforming it into new resources Commission This circu larity view is expanding worldwide Ghosh and Agamuthu Kirchherr et al However emerging economies often face a different situation They generally follow basic sanitation policies without giving priorities or restrictions to HSW sorting and treat ment systems Gutberlet et al Hartmann Welivita et al The novelty is to create a frame to embed waste pick ers WPs as mediators of the circular economy Gutberlet Gutberlet et al Rutkowski and Rutkowski Velis Waste picking is either a predominant or a prominent part of recovering recyclable resources in countries with nancial con straints institutional failure and undeveloped treatment sys tems Velis Many citizens in those countries live under conditions of poverty and unstructured life for the mismanage ment of HSW ie open dumpings and landlling with mixed waste they nd a protable solution to meet socioeconomic needs Ferronato and Torretta Guerrero et al The embeddedness of WPs creates an unconventional reection of the principles and aims of the circular economy Municipalities often do not recognize WPs as service providers and frequently dis criminate against them Azevedo

inte grated WPs be a robust strategy to boost a CE Transparency regarding the denition and understanding of the CE concept and sociointegrated recycling system is needed to answer the research question According to Kirchherr et al The circularity approach seeks for an economic system that replaces the endoflife concept by reducing alternatively reusing recycling and recovering materials in production distribution and consumption processes within the aim to accomplish sustainable development Rutkowski and Rutkowski considered a sociointegrated recycling system ie the procedure of combining informal sectors in urban services by giving WPs socioeconomic opportunities whereby the operational costs and environmental impacts of landlling can be minimised Benets exist in favor of a sociointegrated recycling system but economic prosperity is still the primary aim of the CE and might imply tradeoffs in terms of economic growth Kirchherr et al Kirchherr et al have correlated CE as an approach toward sustainability to bring the perspective that is considered in this study and which stands for creating environmental quality economic prosperity and social equity to the benet of current and future generations simultaneously The integration of WPs in circularity initiatives is an issue to be analyzed on a local scale The situation of WPs can differ among countries or cities because of for example legal issues social behavior and culture Belo Horizonte is a learning platform to answer the research question mentioned above Belo Horizonte is Brazils fourth economic axis and a reliable reference for the orga nizational structure of WPs into cooperatives worldwide Alfaia et al Campos IBGE TiradoSoto and Zamberlan UNHABITAT Through the study case this paper aims to analyze the sociointegration development of indi vidual groups that directly execute or inuence an action in HSW management and to discuss the barriers that WP communities face towards the circular economys purposes The work applies the combination of participant observation Kawulich material ow analysis MFA and structural agent analysis SAA developed by Binder Binder a b The methodological approach brings the focus on the role of agents sel dom studied in HSW management and is fundamental for opera tionalizing CE Bugge et al Marshall and Farahbakhsh This paper is structured as follows Section describes the back ground information of Belo Horizontes case study Section outli nes the methodological framework and the respective research steps carried out in this study Section presents the results of the case study and the discussion Sections and summarize the conclusions A literature review about the situation of Belo Horizonte Belo Horizonte the capital of Minas Gerais state is located in southeast Brazil with a population of about million and an average growth rate of per year since IBGE The mainstays of its economy range over all three economic sectors with iron and steel mining industries packaging food biotechnology business and tourism jewelry as the main branches Belo Horizonte is characterized by high social inequalities with a Gini coefcient of IBGE This socioeconomic situa tion is reected by the high relevance of informal collecting and sorting of HSW Varella Belo Horizonte launched its Munic ipal Solid Waste Plan in after three years of the target having been dened by the Brazilian National Policy on Solid WasteNPSW HORIZONTE NPSW is a political action for munic ipalities to pay attention to the mismanagement of HSW and the integration of WP cooperatives Brazil The plan is based on the status quo of Belo Horizontes HSW management in HORIZONTE Belo Horizonte presents an advantage regarding the integration of WP cooperatives in com parison to other Brazilian cities Belo Horizonte had the rst polit ical initiative to recognize waste pickers as agents of HSW management in the s Campos Jacobi and Teixeira The political initiative demonstrated the working value of WPs who were often confused as being part of the marginalized groups of that time and caused a social and political movement nationally and internationally Campos Campos described how Belo Horizontes political initiative opened opportu nities in line with Eco and helped to establish social and governmental programs such as Garbage and Citizenship and the National Forum Garbage and Citizenship Both programs aimed to promote campaigns against child labor in dumpsites and partic ipative dialogue between governments and WPs funded by the United Nations Childrens Funds and the Brazilian government in and respectively Campos No technological treatment takes place in Belo Horizonte as shown in Fig The conventional system relies on landlling after HSW is reloaded into larger vehicles at the transfer station SLU Consequently the longterm collection of mixed waste motivated social interventions in HSW management activities accompanied by constant popular movements Rutkowski Varella The recycling network system started with CataUni dos in The recycling network systems promote joint action for marketing and technical support to reduce the inuences of the informal sector TiradoSoto and Zamberlan Varella As shown in Fig the formal and the informal waste sec tors still run in parallel in Belo Horizonte The informal sector helps small and mediumsized middlemen businesses by creating the opportunity to generate fast income by selling recyclable waste at the lowest market prices Varella The difference between the formal registered WP cooperatives and the informal sector is the services that formal WP cooperatives provide for the city hall of Belo Horizonte They perform doorto door collection followed by sorting of recyclables at working sheds Varella Thus for formal WPs not only the economic aspect of waste collecting and sorting is of relevance but also their posi tion in the society as service providers for the city Rutkowski Rutkowski and Rutkowski Varella It is due to a signicant gap regarding the efciency of the sociointegrated recycling system that many decisionmakers con sider the Belo Horizonte HSW management to be stagnating HORIZONTE New perspectives from industries bring hope for WP cooperatives to create best practices for the socio integrated system in the context of a circular economy Ometto et al Although the sociointegrated system is part of the national policy BRAZIL b industries and Belo Horizontes city council remain locked in a stalemate when it comes to invest ing in HSW management Research method and data Overview This study carried out three main stages that enable an indepth analysis of the dynamics of a reallife setting of the case study cho sen as displayed in Fig The rst stage aimed to disclose the characteristics of the system under review indepth and to gather primary data This step followed the qualitative method approach of participatoryM Fuss Raphael TV Barros and WitoldRoger Poganietz Waste Management observation Kawulich to obtain an understanding and direct contact with the status quo of Belo Horizontes city and its HSW management The analysis started with prolonged eldwork done in carried out by one of the researchers an observer and supported by a native researcher The rst method approach Stage helped the team to confront information from the literature review see Section and the different views of a native from an observer of the situation It enabled the authors to identify issues and agents and to familiarizethemselves with the formal and informal activities and interac tions such as unplanned activities Mainly WPs were observed as to how they were acting during daytoday activities Their historical backgrounds and beliefs were taken into account in interviews The producers of household solid wastes were also investigated Different parts of the city were visited to nd outmainly how the society acts regarding waste generation integra tion of WPs and satisfaction with the current HSW management situation The studys rst stage was documented through Fig Belo Horizontes HSW management in Processes are part of the descriptions presented in Varella and SLU Fig Research method stages based on a combination of participatory observation and MFASAA Stages adapted from Binder b Kawulich M Fuss Raphael TV Barros and WitoldRoger Poganietz Waste Management pictures and recorded videos to be used in the subsequent research processes One of the researchers of the study the one who conducted the participatory observation became integrated in the Waste and Citizenship Forum of Belo Horizonte His involvement lead to the establishment of a platform of communication with about agents of Belo Horizonte This platform was essential for develop ing structural agent analysis SAA Direct contact with local agents enabled us to gain access to historical annual reports done by the city hall and WP cooperatives These reports helped to build a data platform of a multiyear material ow analysis MFA This study analyzed a time range of years It considered the transition before the implementation of recycling networks and the reference year of the Municipal Solid Waste Plan see Sec tion The targets presented in the Municipal Solid Waste Plan and the semistructured interviews with the agents supplemented the interpretation of MFASAA to provide an uptodate discussion of the ndings Stage Detailed characterization of MFASAA While MFA is well established in the eld of waste manage ment agent analysis is a common tool in the eld of sociology Binder a Graedel Long Moriguchi and Hashimoto This paper is related to the combined issues identied in recyclable materials ow analysis and the social impacts of urban systems predominated by WPs Thus it is neither a single analytical analysis MFA nor a sociological analysis SAA per se The application of MFASAA helped to investigate the rela tionship between agents and structural mechanisms by recogniz ing conicts driven by economic sociological and psychological issues Especially regarding the development of cities decision makers have problems in understanding the physical results pro vided by an MFA because the results are derived from conicts of actions by agents Binder a Thus MFASAA was developed to overcome the need to integrate the impact of social structures eg legislation culture and economic systems on human actions to assist decisionmakers in understanding in a practical manner the systematic assessment of MFA Binder a b Brunner and Rechberger One challenge identied in analyzing the city of Belo Horizonte is that there are no precise system boundaries when taking into account the circularity approach of recyclable materials The scope of this study entailed that each agent corresponded to a physical system according to the conceptual framework for MFASAA Binder a However the society of Belo Horizonte is exposed to all products available at the national level ie the modeling approach focused on various consumer packaging products Thisapproach provided an indepth analysis of the material ow sector legislation and market regarding the product value chain At the city level MFA follows Belo Horizontes recyclable HSW management see Fig which allows quantifying recyclable waste generation sorting routes treatment and disposal Sorting rates follow the split into closed and openloop collection rates following the recommendations of ISO and reported inHaupt et al Closedloop recycling pursues recyclables that can still substitute original resources for the traditional pro cessing industry while recyclables from openloop recycling aim at a different type of resources for any other undened industrial process Haupt et al From the participatory observation Stage and MFA results three major steps constituted the SAA Binder a in this study I Classication of the relevant agents ie integration of out comes from the participatory observation according to their impact on the variables driving the MFA system For example WPs are already predened agents of this study The sorting processes of recyclable materials relate directly to them affecting for example the aluminum can ows II Breakdown of structural factors into allocative resources economics and market related interactions for recyclables legitimation eg legislation for collectivism production of packaging materials recycling and cultural values eg sig nicance of traditions the WPs live in At the level of WP cooperatives the drivers and motivators for the behavior model of the sociorecycling system are investigated Fol lowing behavioral economics the psychological approach that drives WPs was analyzed and interpreted Hoff and Walsh Madrian III Visualization of the SAA outcomes through the agent structure diagram The diagram shows the structural factorsdriving agents actions and interactions Details of the MFASAA modeling framework can be found in the supporting information S Data management The application of MFASAA requires two types of data and thus two types of data gathering Local reports are the background data to build the HSW management system for Belo Horizonte Additionally national reports provided secondary data for recy clable packaging production for food industries This study followed the MFA principle that total production in mass matches the total consumption demand availability while total consumption must correspond to the total post consumption accumulation and discard Brunner and Rechberger Thereby the transformation of packaging cate gories exante into waste products expost moves across the sys tem and vice versa The disaggregation procedures applied the same reasonable hypothesis based on the technique introduced byCourtonne et al p consumption is almost propor tional to the population growth For instance the consumption of glass U at a local scale would be UiUCki k where Uistands for consumption of a product here glass in region i in tons Ufor nationwide consumption of the product in tons kifor the population of the corresponding region i and kstands for the total population of the country under investigation here of Brazil The index istands for Belo Horizonte Likewise a relatively high data uncertainty is identied when the mass balance model is developed for both the years of and This study pays attention to this drawback by analyzing the uncertainties of the data input for MFA The methodological approach follows the method presented by Laner and colleagues Laner et al which combines data classication and exponentialtype uncertainty characterization functions The MFA models for and are built using the free platform sub STance ow ANalysis STAN Cencic and Rechberger Table sums up the primary data sources used for MFA All equa tions and process descriptions are available in the supplementary material The SAA follows the qualitative approach based on semi structured interviews and secondary data to determine the alloca tive resources legitimation and cultural values The output of par ticipatory observation helped to fulll the rst and second steps of SAA see Section For example after the eldwork semi structured interviews were often conducted with NGOs public authorities waste pickers local recycling industries and local HSW researchers to analyze the prolonged individual relationshipsM Fuss Raphael TV Barros and WitoldRoger Poganietz Waste Management with other agents within the recyclable materials chain Regulation structures were identied according to the sorting products dis cussed with WP cooperatives and NGOs The agent diagram was reviewed with experts on the eld of HSW management and sys tem analysis Table describes the main data sources used for SAA Results The ndings of the participatory observations Stage are inte grated into the results of the MFASAA and are presented as fol lows Pictures of the participatory observation and the MFA diagrams can be found in the supplementary material Recyclable waste ows and the impact on the circularity approach The MFA started from the perspective to certify the amount of waste generated in Belo Horizonte by households and commercial places Between and the total recyclable waste genera tion increased from about kt to kt respectively by an average growth of each year The main reasons for the growth are rapidly increasing incomes about each year higher demands for recyclable products and a growing population In the same period the net accumulation increased from kt to kt The composition of the recyclable waste changed in due course see Table Although plastics particularly PETs and PEs are losing relevance from a share to of the total generation the growth rate of is highly signicant Paper waste in total is outperforming the general development of waste generation from to with an annual growth of in contrast to a growth in plastics The overall collection rate of Belo Horizonte improved from to Therefore not more than of recyclable waste could be assigned as input to WP cooperatives for both years ie in about kt and kt in The remaining fraction is collected together with the wet waste and disposed of in landll sites The organization of the sociocooperatives in recycling net works shows the impact of changes in the input ows on recycling processes WP cooperatives are becoming more professionalized Each member has assumed a labor division of collecting selective collection sorting with or without the support of bells mechan ical recycling ie shredding or pressing and assisting the ofce staff Their participation in selective collection has supported min imization of the impurities usually related to sand or stones used as lling to add to the weight of aluminum cans and the commu nication of the quality conditions of cleanliness regarding card board Such attitudes reected that of the total material sorted by WP cooperatives could be assigned to the closedloop recycling system in see Table The largest share corre sponds to aluminum cans followed by PET bottles and cardboard Both aluminum cans and cardboard always have been

Fuss Raphael TV Barros and WitoldRoger Poganietz Waste Management cleanest compared to any other recyclable wastes The difference between both waste products is the strong market demand for alu minum cans with their market price being around R kg in contrast to that of cardboard of R kg in CEMPRE PET bottles have become attractive for WP cooperatives in Belo Horizonte because of an increased generation and competi tion for aluminum cans within the informal sector Wherever pos sible closedloop recycling was indicated following the recycling rates of aluminum ABRALATAS cardboard ABPO and PET associations ABIPET However the recycling net work systems reported the logistic challenge of trading directly with these primary production industries In the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte only preprocessing recycling industries exist eg smelting aluminum shredding PET and crushing card board bales whilst the largest nal product industries are located in Rio de Janeiro km Sao Paulo km and Curitiba km ABIPET ABPO ABRALATAS Openloop recycling gives the opportunity for recycling net works to directly start the trade of sorted recyclables with small to mediumsized recycling companies without the intervention of middlemen as was common in The challenge the formal WP cooperatives face is the low quality of recyclable waste received from thirdparty companies that are responsible for the selective collection WP cooperatives conrmed that an average of of the recyclable waste was rejected after coarse and ne sorting there were no signicant changes in the quality of waste received by service companies over the years Therefore after the recycling network systems WP cooperatives discovered a new col laboration with the retail trade sector eg hypermarkets and shopping centers to obtain a better quality of recyclable waste especially paper waste Thus compressed bales of sorted paper are underestimated of the total in small companies of toilet paper and tissue production that belong to the trade network of the recycling networks The purpose of CataUnidos started in is the mechanical transformation of colored PET Pes and PP into pellets Based onthe number of WPs in cooperatives and the share of metals in total waste input for the recycling networks it is estimated that of the openloop recycling of plastics see Table were transformed into pellets and later designated to the steel industry as a substi tute for coke The remaining fraction is supposed to be commer cialized with textile and unsaturated and alkyd resin industries in the metropolitan region A specic share of plastic bales desig nated for each industry is unknown Glass waste has been considered a troublesome material Belo Horizonte has more than food kiosks eg bars and infor mal food meal spots being the largest Brazilian reference where the local population and tourists socialize Kugel Such com mercial activities explain the growing rate of glass waste by see Table Therefore WP cooperatives who sorted glass eg bottles let the glass accumulate at their sheds because a market for such material did not exist The crushing process to minimizethe cargo volume for transportation to glass industries located in other states Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro is a barrier faced by recycling networks The sociointegrated recycling system in the view of SAA The SAA results showed that HSW creates a contradicting effect and the role of each involved agent presents fragments of signi cance in Belo Horizonte For WPs who are members of a formal cooperative sorting waste brings opportunities to guarantee a bet ter educational system for future generations On the other hand many citizens consider waste sorting a timeconsuming task because the city hall service providers privately or not mix HSW during conventional collection Nevertheless in general householders do not assume the responsibility of collaborating to improve the local system There are different legislations without interconnection This reects how allocative resources eg the market price of recyclables and the income of WPs are controlled The overall responsibility of HSW management is with the city council while formal WPs have raised the jurisdiction issue toTable Composition of Belo Horizonte recyclable waste vs output of WPs cooperatives ta Waste product GenerationWP

agents depicted in ovals interact according to the structural elements gray boxes identi ed The arrows indicate the relationship of agents demanding ser vices associated with ows of materials direct agents or technical assistance indirect agents such as standards knowledge and rights At the same time industries play a direct or indirect role by demanding highquality sorting of recyclables while leading enterprises assist with setting technical standards The core of the sociointegrated recycling system is the consol idation of waste pickers in HSW management the central agent shown in the structure diagram Fig Two pairs of regulatory structures drive agents actions culture legislation a robust local characteristic and market mechanism legislation a merger of local regional and national rules The culture legislation mechanism represent the merger of cul tural values and legitimation It consolidates the position of WPs today as the outcome of a longlasting historical process symbol ized by political persecution and discrimination from the Belo Hor izonte society The Street Charity Pastoral locally known as Pastoral da Rua substantially participated in the socio integrated system in Belo Horizonte Jacobi and Teixeira The church community was primarily for providing educational awareness campaigns to minimize the marginalized view of WPs It protected them against violent attacks often tolerated by the city council and intermediated the process to claim their rights more effectively among decisionmakers in the s Jacobi andTeixeira Nowadays they mediate the integration of infor mal WPs into legalized cooperatives together with NGOs Fig In no prescribed number of WPs is registered There are eight cooperatives with about WPs in Belo Horizonte regis tered in The formal WP cooperatives differ regarding the number of members ranging from to Since then they have all been integrated into recycling network systems formed by two organizational structures named CataUnidos as previously men tioned and RedeSol Both organizations aim to create socio entrepreneurship induced by NGOs CataUnidos or are self organized RedeSol They mainly act where selective collection occurs In selective collection reached of neighbor hoods and serviced about of the total population Table sum marizes the specic characteristics that differentiate between the two recycling networks daily work performances and subsequentroles in HSW management The enactment of the NPSW BRAZIL b and the national decree for social inclusion BRAZIL came to regulate the sociointegrated recycling system by conceding WPs as a recog nized profession determining the recycling process and giving pri ority to socioentrepreneurship of WP cooperatives Within the scope of the NPSW different funding programs such as Pro Collector and Cataforte and the National Secretary of Solidarity Economy opened the opportunity to consolidate the recycling net work systems by giving CataUnidos for example the infrastructure conditions to establish a plastic pellets facility in The integrated social system in Belo Horizonte differs from that of other Brazilian cities that failed to implement the socio Fig Agent structure diagram within the scope of the sociointegrated recycling system Adapted SAA diagram based on Binder bM Fuss Raphael TV Barros and WitoldRoger Poganietz Waste Management integrated model due to trust TiradoSoto and Zamberlan The cultural behavior of both recycling networks reinforces the commitment of together we can act better The collectivism and solidarity commitment constitutes the primary internal understanding of the cooperatives members who assist one another through training and support the participatory events through the external embeddedness of WP cooperatives in front of local and Brazilian societies All members and the cooperative need to follow the normative law for a cooperative system BRAZIL a the statute for WPs MNCR and the respec tive amendments reported in the local union legislation Recycling networks regulate the cooperatives while the cooperatives regu late WPs according to requirements as follows da Silva I no child labor II WPs must be registered at a cooperative III legalized WP cooperative or in the process of legalization with a xed address IV equitable participation without the dictate of rules V ban of trade with middlemen considered as an action against reciprocity and commitment to collectivism VI promoting physical security equipment and payment from the Brazilian Social Security Institute for Retirement INSS VII being approved after the application for a membership at an assembly The exploitation of other WPs by dictating rules and the trading outside of the market network through middlemen are the pri mary reasons that usually cancel the membership of WPs and WP cooperatives in the network systems The integration of informal WPs into the cooperative is consid ered a challenge The prole of Belo Horizontes informal waste pickers reects the social identity described by Souza as the riffraff class They are extremely poor citizens according to the national socioeconomic classication SAE They are part of the of Belo Horizontes population who have been out of the job market for a long time IBGE SAE But they still hope to nd moonlighting jobs and to leave the business of waste picking These citizens are skeptical about the cooperative system due to many other social disturbances eg drug use alco holism and homelessness Nevertheless they nd waste picking the last worthy chance for obtaining quick daily income rather than turning to delinquency Market mechanism legislation describe the allocative resources and legitimation They determine the recycling path which lackstransparency among local agents because legislation is dened at the national level Federal law imposed by the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency ANVISA and technical standards for industrial processes standardization NBR regulate packag ing products for food and beverage industries the primary source of HSW The federal packaging legislation follows international market regulations eg Mercosul and American Food and Drug Administration FDA to guarantee national consumption and export of packaging for goods as well as packaged food and bever age ANVISA For instance the FDA permits food industries to use PP and HDPE as secondary sources from industrial processes that follow the patent technologies roadmap with a controlled sup ply chain ABRE The supply of secondary resources cannot be ensured due to the challenge between the public sector and industry regarding theresponsibilities for recycling costs WP cooperatives are responsi ble for transportation and cannot afford long distances There are patterns to follow for some recyclable products in Brazil Closed loop recycling is allowed for metal and glass packaging because of their high durability mechanical resistance without losing quality and wellset standardized decontamination procedures ANVISA Paper and PET were included on the list for closedloop recycling with some additional restrictions controlled by ANVISA in ANVISA For instance multilayers are regulated for the use of PET and paper secondary resources where recycled PET and paper must not have direct contact with food and beverage contents ANVISA Under this circumstance regu lations imposed by ANVISA are seen as a bureaucracy for packaging industries that use mainly secondary resources originating from the industrial output ABIPET BRACELPA Closedloop recycling from HSW management is a low attrac tion for investment for largescale packaging industries although the prices of primary resources eg plastic resins and cellulose are increasing BRASKEN Petri An exception is the Brazilian Association for Aluminum Cans ABRALATAS which in the recycling process found an alternative method for minimizing energy demand and the dependence on the primary sector by investing in closedloop recycling countrywide Because of that many WP cooperatives in Belo Horizonte became exclusively alu minum can pickers creating a highly competitive system On the other hand Brazil became the country worldwide leading in recy cled aluminum cans ABRALATAS Quite the opposite hap pened in the case of the glass beverage industries where returning glass bottles to the producer was stied Returnable glass bottles was the market strategy implemented by specic beverage brand industries that started in the s and continued until Bouas This strategy has been lost because of substi tution for plastic bottles lack of investment into collection stations and the decrease in prices of raw materials which do not make recycling attractive Bouas Although it was a com mercial strategy returnable glass bottles were well accepted as a successful engagement of society in Belo Horizonte A market mechanism for openloop recycling is growing and new products are becoming attractive for sorting at WP coopera tives With the interest in opening new businesses small enter prises look for purchasing goodquality recyclables mainly paper and plastic from the recycling networks by sometimes offering them the transportation service as a bonus Discussion The results of this study combined insights from bottomup local intervention and topdown at the

bottomup No agreement could consolidate these different scales agents and interests for optimal development MFASAA results showed that waste generation increases in Belo Horizonte The number of formal WPs is low According to Table each member achieved an average of sorted recyclables of kgmonth excluding rejects in National statistics stand that such average capacity demonstrates the low efciency of the WP cooperatives and the need for a better infrastructure to achieve an average of kgmonth based on the national standard for high efciency da Silva WP cooperatives have limited support to boost their strategies because recycling net works face the challenge of the low quality of recyclable wastes received and a large number of recyclables disposed of withoutpretreatment in Belo Horizonte Local industries usually nd other accessible alternatives without the involvement of HSW manage ment The bureaucracy and contamination constraints impede the recyclable loop from being closed The macroscale perspective of the CE concept makes it a new buzzword in the discourse of integrating WPs Recyclable HSW is becoming highly competitive because of numerous recycling options and recycling networks can be smothered if they remain between industries and the city council due to a clash of interests Recycling networks are built based on social values that create niches for breaking economic and technical barriers and pushing them to claim rights The embeddedness of WPs in CE needs to consider further limitations The infrastructure of CataUnidos and RedeSol is precarious Working sheds are small and need refurbish ment A formal WP cooperative is usually made up of women and men most from to years old with incomplete pri mary education backgrounds ASMARE Many women described private issues eg chauvinism that limited them from entering the market during an early stage of their lives and recy clable waste opened new socioeconomic paths The beliefs are the primary motivation to bring them together Members of CataU nidos described their wishes to give a prosperous future to their children far away from the marginality within a better educational perspective Such commitment brings cultural values of collec tivism and solidarity to the same work platform Additionally it is seen that reciprocity exists by creating attitudes of friendship between the recycling networks although they have different orga nizational structures see Table However a CE focused on the future development of society accomplishing sustainable development Kirchherr et al could open opportunities Recycling networks need to focus on a target group industries or city councils or become independent recycling companies Industries require a controlled supply chain of secondary resources ie legitimation CataUnidos has shown positive initia tives for urban industrial symbiosis within plastic pellet produc tion Plastic pellets are an alternative to fossil resources in the steel industry which is one of the most energyintensive industries and one of the largest CO emitters in Brazil Carvalho et al Such an attitude is seen in this study as a positive balance of the two worlds HSWM and industries lower emissions from indus tries and less plastic landlled Professional assistance is needed to support WP cooperatives by identifying industrial needs or determining how to build a controlled supply chain The city council requires trustful services with low costs to assume the selective collection system Selective collection is the most costly process and it does not cover the entire city of BeloHorizonte SLU New alternatives need to be found that are not accounted for in the management plan of Belo Horizonte HORIZONTE For instance doortodoor selective collection per recyclable category done by WPs could be a new regulation Such initiative would create interventions to support societys adoption of better rules for sorting waste Selfsufcient recycling companies demand new products open loop recycling in the market Small enterprises start after the ini tiative to become WP cooperatives Most of them are composed of handicraft persons or technicians who develop new products from waste Such path requests more funding programs on a national scale by offering equal opportunities in both technological and capacity building In general for any functioning system focused on a target group a fair market price for recyclable waste needs to be regulated by giving value to the workload and efforts provided by WPs Besides that the number of waste cooperatives needs to increase Nowadays an average of based on national statis tics to citizens based on the socioeconomic classication for extremely poor citizens could be informal WPs The barrier of implicit discrimination requires considerable efforts to minimize psychological challenges Hoff and Walsh Conclusion The ndings of this study conrm that a CE approach can be too broad to boost sociointegrated systems for HSW management if it is taken at a macro scale The macro perspective of the CE concept obscures the real problem procedures challenges and even tar gets The application of participatory observation merged into MFASAA presented the dynamics of reallife settings that threaten to prevent putting into practice the CE approach in Belo Horizonte Brazil The MFA results showed quantitatively that the challenge starts with waste generation increasing from about kt to kt between and The SAA discussed the regulatory structures that encompass cultural values grounded on collec tivism solidarity and reciprocity market mechanisms and legis lation constraints The number of WPs registered in cooperatives the market price set up by recycling companies regulatory legisla tion for packing products and new small enterprises promoting openloop recycling are among the identied barriers that create obstacles for development of the sociointegrated system within the practice of CE WPs are part of society in constant development crossing cul tures and behaviors from country to country city to city or even neighborhood to neighborhood This study discussed suggestions that can apply to other cities For instance knowing the target group brings opportunities for WPs to disclose niches based on a small network of agents with expectations and visions and can create sociotechnical regimes to implement a conscious and sus tainable CE Therefore changes eg adapting the approach close to primary industries need to be considered along with the trans formation processes Given the growing role of waste generation in emerging economies there is a need to develop a salubrious work ing environment for those people that are committed with an aware or unaware behavior to collaborating with a practical approach to the CE Also effective communication and mutual understanding of the vulnerabilities of sociointegrated recyclingsystems need to be further developed and the single view on costsaving needs to be minimized to create trends to act on sus tainable and local CE The number of women in the workforce grew from the year reaching of the
