Phosphorus circular economy of disposable baby nappy waste Quanti cation assessment of recycling technologies and plan for sustainability Rubel Biswas Chowdhury Mayuri Wijayasundara School of Engineering Deakin University Waurn Ponds Victoria Australia HIGHLIGHTS Australia lost tonne phosphorus P in baby nappy waste in P recovery is overlooked in most of the recycling technologies for nappy waste Composting pyrolysis and polymer separation are common nappy recycling methods Use of nappy waste compost for bam boo and cotton production can close the loop New product and system design can help achieve P circular economy of nappy wasteGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT abstract article info Article history Received June Received in revised form July Accepted July Available online July Editor Frederic CoulonThis study assessed the potential for minimizing human excreta bound phosphorus P loss through used dispos able baby nappies an area that remained unexplored for nations Accordingly it performed a substance ow analysis to assess the national P loss through used disposable baby nappies in the case of Australia The analysis revealed that approximately tonne P is lost through used baby nappies to land lls in Australia in which is nearly of the overall P excreta as human waste Although the quantity seems small in percentage term it could result in the loss of a signi cant amount of P over several years as assessed tonne P over the period which is concerning in the context of anticipated future global P scarcity The review of peerreviewed literature on available technologiesmethods for recycling disposable baby nappy waste indicates that there are some technologies for recycling P particularly through cocomposting with food and other organic wastes while the majority of these are still at the labpilot scale There are also various recycling techniques with purpose ranging from energy recovery to volume reduction generation of pulp hydrogel cellulose and polymer as well as to increase yield stress and viscosity of concrete however these are not effective in P recovery The study implies that compost made of nappy waste can be used as fertilizer to produce bamboo cotton and maize plants to supply raw materials for producing biodegradable nappies hence to close the loop The various product and system design options eg designing for ushing designing for disassembling the excreta containing part and designing for community composting suggested in this study could be further researched for identifying best suitable option to achieve P circular economy of disposable baby nappies This study also recommends nec essary interventions at various stages of the nappy life cycle to ensure sustainable management of phosphorus E l s e v i e rB V A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v

wwwelseviercomlocatescitotenv Introduction Phosphorus P is a nonsubstitutable essential element for the growth and survival of all living organisms including plant animal and microorganisms The modern global food production system is heavily reliant on the application of commercial P fertilizers which mainly sourced through the mining of phosphate rock a nonrenewable and geographically restricted resource The dwindling global reserves of phosphate rock with a lifetime of few hundred years is restricted to only a few countries mainly Morocco with ap proximately of the global reserves and the majority of the countries rely on P import for food production The increasing de mand of P for producing food for growing global population the dwindling reserves and geopolitical constraints likely to create P scarcity in future and farmers of many countries mainly economi cally poor and developing countries may lose their access to com mercial P fertilizers which may ultimately result in food insecurity Chowdhury et al The excessive loss of P from the agricultural and waste management systems to water bodies around the world not only resulting in the depletion of the limited global P resource but also destroying valuable aquatic ecosystems and water resources by causing algal bloom and eutrophication which is clearly evident from many re cent studies Chowdhury et al The importance of minimizing P loss from various systems particularly the waste management system for the sustainable management of this limited global resource is well known Rahman et al The available substance ow analyses of P indicates that worldwide nearly of the mined P is consumed in human food which ultimately ends up in human excreta Cordell et al Rahman et al Al though the importance of P recovery from human excreta that is col lected and managed through the wastewater collection and treatment systems in many countries was addressed in numerous literature Harder et al Metson et al the fraction of P in human ex creta that is lost through disposable baby nappies in a country was not assessed in any of the available substance ow analyses of P that pub lished in peer reviewed journals Chowdhury et al Rahman et al Hence there is a clear knowledge gap of understanding the magnitude of P loss through used disposable baby nappies to land ll for nations Disposable baby nappies shortened term for baby napkins and referred to as diapers in some countries are the absorbent hygieneproduct that is mainly used by infant and toddlers to retain urine and feces until they are prepared to use a sanitary facility to dispose of human excreta mostly up to to years A snapshot of the compo nentsstructure of commonly used baby nappies as presented by Khoo et al is provided in the Supplementary Fig S see Appendix A Supplementary material The tendency to use disposable baby nappies has increased over time The global production of disposable nappies is expected to increase to US billion per annum by from US billion in Markets Insider Disposable baby nappy waste that mostly ends up in land ll is currently a big burden for municipal solid waste management in many countries Our prelimi nary literature search con rmed that there is a lacking of literature to provide a clear understanding of the potential for P recovery from baby nappies We are also unaware of a thorough review of available recycling technologiesmethods for disposable baby nappy waste to un derstand the bene cial aspects and limitations and to assess the methods that are effective in recovery and recycling of P and other nutrients Therefore the objectives of this study are to i Quantity of P that is lost through used disposable baby nappies in the case of Australia using basic substance ow analysis ap proach ii Conduct a systematic review of available recycling methods technologies of disposable baby nappies worldwide to identify the suitable techniques for P recovery the limitationschallengesof existing methods in terms of nutrient recovery and potential areas for improvement and iii Based on that review present necessary interventions at the var ious stages of the nappy life cycle to ensure P circular economy Methods of analysis Quanti cation of P ow through disposable baby nappies in Australia Method considered for the quanti cation of P ow For the quantitative analysis of P ow through disposable baby nappies at the national scale for Australia this study utilized the methods of substance ow analysis SFA that applies the principle of mass balance to assess the ows and stocks of substance in a system de ned in space and time Van der Voet Brunner and Rechberger The basic steps of this method are i De ne systems and subsys tems and a selection of system boundaries ii de ne material and pro cessows associated with each system and subsystem iii collect quantitative data on materialprocess ow and concentration of sub stance in each materialsprocess iv analyse the data for calculating substance ow and storage using appropriate software modelling v assess the reliability and uncertainty of the results and vi interpret the results and provide decisions De ning system and system boundaries and pathways of ows The system considered for the current analysis of P loss through used disposable baby nappies in Australia is the food consumption and waste management system The pathways of P ow across the system and subsystems considered and associated system and subsystem bound aries are presented in Fig A multiyear time scale is con sidered as the temporal scale for analysis Data utilized and assumptions considered for the quanti cation of P ow Data utilized for the quanti cation of P ow is baby population data according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on estimated resi dent population by single year of age ABS and the rate of daily P intake data according to Australian Health Survey Nutrition First Results Foods and Nutrients ABS This is to clarify that for baby population data three age ranges are considered ie to year to year and to year The reason for considering that age group is in Australia potty trainings to babies are given ap proximately at the age between and years as con rmed based on the review of available reports published online therefore nappies are usually used for babies until they turn years However in Australia approximately of the parents use disposable nappies ABC News while the rest use cloth nappies or reusable nappies Therefore for this calculation this study considers population of the to years age group Most of the P intake as food in human bodies eventually ends up in human excreta Cordell et al Cordell et al therefore this study consider of the P intake ended up in human excreta The rate of daily P intake for each age range is de termined based on the calculated average rate of increment in P intake with age according to Australian Health Survey data as men tioned above see Appendix A Supplementary material for data and calculations The majority of the human excreta mainly for population of age year or above ends up in wastewater treatment plants while the baby nappy bound human excreta mostly collected through solid waste stream and eventually ends up in land ll if not systematically recycled The assumptions considered in this study may vary from na tion to nation depending upon the situation of baby nappy use Calculation of P ows The calculation was done by multiplying the total number of baby population of each age range in Australia with the rate of daily P excreta by each baby of that age range and then multiplying the product by RB Chowdhury and M Wijayasundara Science of the Total Environment days to obtain the total annual P loss for a particular year for the babies of that age range Similarly we calculated total P loss for babies of other age ranges for that particular year and nally summed up the P loss for all age ranges to obtain the total loss for Australia The methods of calcu lation for P ow through disposable baby nappy waste for Australia is briey presented below i Calculation of baby population that use disposable baby nappies Total baby

of the pre vious analyses for performing SFA of P various types of software eg STAN Roy et al MATLABSimulink Chowdhury et al and MS Excel and STAN Baroi et al were utilized Consid ering that the current analysis is comparatively less complex MS Excel software was utilized for the calculation of P loss for all of the years considered following the methods explained above see Appendix A Supplementary material for data and calculations Approach for reliability assessment To check the consistency of the results we utilized an alternative data on the rate of P excreta that is the rate of P production per capita per year according to Mihelcic et al who estimated the global potential for P recovery from human urine and feces The results of both calculations were then systematically compared to check the con sistency see Appendix A Supplementary material for calculations details Review of different technologies for recycling baby nappies Approach for search and selection of literature for review For the current review in order to identify peerreviewed journal ar ticles that assessed different technologiesmethods for recycling dispos able baby nappies we performed a

sustainable management baby nappies and circular economy of baby nappies Through a quick reading of the title and ab stract if needed for each article we have initially screened journal articles from around the world that somewhat addressed the recycling of baby nappies and nally we have selected studies following the below criteria to perform a thorough review i The article adequately

captured the recent advancement in recycling of baby nappies iii Information necessary to perform the current review is possible to extract and organize in a systematic order Approach for extraction of key information from selected literature To perform an indepth and systematic review we have developed a methodical approach that allows extracting all key information from the selected articles for this review In this approach we have initially dis sected each journal articles into three major parts i Purpose and meth odology ii ndingsresults and discussion and iii recommendations and future research needs and did careful reading of each part to extract the key information We eventually came up with a tabular structure with a number of columns with headings ie recoveryrecycling tech

limitations that allowed to systematically capture the key informa tion from each of the selected article Results and discussion Quantitative picture of national P loss through baby nappies in Australia Each year around billion disposable baby nappies are used in Australia that eventually ends up in land lls ABC News with traditional disposable baby nappies estimated to take up to years to break down Sustainability Victoria The human excreta urine and feces that ends up through baby nappies in Australian land ll also cause the emission of methane a greenhouse gas that is times more potent than Carbon dioxide By weight nearly of the used baby nappies is urine Coln et al containing a considerable amount of P Mihelcic et al Thus a substantial amount of human excreta bound P and other nutrients eg nitrogen also ends up in land lls through disposal of used baby nappies Although a num ber of city councils local government administrative bodies in Australia currently offer rebates to households that switch to cloth nappies from disposable baby nappies mainly with the aim to reduce the amount of wastes reaching to land lls Cook initiatives for the recovery and recycling of P and other nutrients from disposable baby nappies are still lacking Therst substance ow analysis of P relating to disposable baby nappies in Australia as performed in this study indicates that nearly t of P ended up in land ll areas in which accounts for approx imately of the overall P t excreted as human waste in that year Fig Although the amount looks small in percentage term for a single year if not recovered and recycled through a circular economy approach this could result in the loss of a signi cant amount of P over a longer term The multiyear analysis of P loss through baby nappies as presented in Fig indicates that over the period of nearly t of P was lost in land ll areas of Australia Considering P is a nonsubstitutable nonrenewable nite and geographicallyrestricted resources and the urgency of closing the loops in the global P cycle Cordell et al Chowdhury et al recovering and recycling that amount of P is essential Moreover considering the asso ciated life cycle environmental impacts Ng et al Cordella et al systematic recycling of disposable baby nappies is much re quired Although the application of circular economy approaches for recycling baby nappies is underway Khoo et al Mendoza et al it is essential to consider the perspective of P loss associated with baby nappies and nding recycling techniques or methods effec tive in recovery of nutrients along with other elements Compared to other pathways of P oss mainly from the agricultural system such as soil erosion and runoff loss it is comparatively easier to track down and manage P ow associated with baby nappies as systematic collec tion of household wastes and recovery of P through formal municipal waste management system is possible Rahman et al This study only presents the quantitative picture of P loss through baby nappies in the case of Australia However other developed nations with similar socioeconomic conditions likely to have more or less sim ilar types and magnitudes of P loss through baby nappies Utilizing the conceptual model that present systems and system boundaries and pathways of P ow through baby nappies Fig as well as the methods for calculation of P ow as presented in this study similar quantitative assessments should be performed for other economically developed countries where disposable baby nappies are commonly used Accord ingly it is required to perform a SFA for quantifying the total global P loss through baby nappies which could be done in our future study Currently there is a clear knowledge gap in this regard Review of available technologiesmethods for recycling disposable baby nappies The review of available published peerreviewed journal articles on various baby nappy recycling technologiesmethods as presented in Table helped to understand the potential and limitations in terms of P and other nutrient recovery Technologiesmethods suitable for nutrient recycling A number of studies attempted to understand the potential for recycling baby nappies through composting with food and other organic wastes For instance Tsigkou et al a examined the potential for composting of anaerobic sludge from the codigestion of used dispos able nappies and expired food products while Coln et al assessed the potential for composting of nappies with source separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste OFMSW Although both composting methods were found quite suitable for nutrient recov ery they have some bene cial aspects and limitations as presented in Table For instance the composting method of Tsigkou et al a identi ed inability to eliminate harmful bacteria like Salmonella and En terococcus spp due to low composting temperature as one of the limi tations while the study of Coln et al found slightly higher concentration of zinc as the shortcoming In an experiment of composting of doortodoor collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste with a ww weight per weight of compostable nappies in Barcelona Spain Coln et al identi ed that both the composting process and the nal compost product are not altered by the use of compostable nappies in some important as pects like the content of pathogen stability and elemental eg nutrient and heavy metal composition Although they suggested the use of compostable nappies as a real alternative to disposable nappies with no technical issues they emphasized on the need for a complete life cycle assessment LCA of all the processes to assess the sustainability and environmental impact Another study of the Municipality of Coroico in Bolivia where the organic fraction fecal residues and cellulosic poly mers is separated from the plastic part and composted that with locally available components like cow dung activated bacteria and Californian red earthworms Although this was the rst approach for utilizingRB Chowdhury and M Wijayasundara Science of the Total Environment vermicomposting for treating disposable nappies they found it a suit able approach for circular economy Another interesting approach which is also suitable for nutrient recovery from used disposable nappies was examined by Nobel and Han where cellulose and superabsorbent polymers in baby nappies are broken down through soaking shredded nappies in various concentration of sodium hydrox ide solutions to release nutrients from urine and feces to the solution The risk of pathogen borne disease from vegetables produced using fecal sludge is often a key concern Butte et al Espinosa Valdemar et al experimented the biodegradation of used baby nappies by the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus Oyster mushroom in Mexico and found that harvested mushrooms had good appearance and protein content and were free of human disease pathogens Similar outcome was observed by another study by Ma et al in Tereng ganu Malaysia that used nappy and food waste as growth substitute forOyster mushroom Both studies also indicated signi cant reduction of weight of biodegradable materials Technologiesmethods suitable for recycling of other resources Apart from the technologies and methods suitable for recycling of P and other nutrients a number of other recycling technologiesmethods for baby nappies also reported as presented in Table For instance Ichiura et al examined the possibility of recycling disposable nappy waste pulp after dehydrating the superabsorbent polymer through oxidation using ozone They observed that the water absorptivity of the recovered pulp was almost the same as virgin pulp and was higher than the standard value of gg grams per gram Almeida et al attempted to identify the composition of each layer of disposable baby nappies and employed thermal analytical tech niques TG ThermogravimetryDTG Derivative

et al suggested that separating superabsorbent polymer from used bab y nappies and utilizing that as soil additives could substantially increas e the moisture retention capacity of soil Some other recycling technologiesmethods of used baby nappies are also presented along with their advantages and limitations in Table This is apparent that all of the various types of recycling approaches explained above have some positive aspects in terms of resource recov ery and recycling as well as minimizing life cycle environmental impactHowever most of these methods are either at lab experiment or pilotstage and without the practical and largescale implementation it would not be possible to understand how appropriate or effective these techniques are Considering the ndings of the current review we suggest that focus should be given on reducing the life cycle environ mental impact diverting these wastes going to land ll through recycling and a balanced and costeffective recovery of key resources eg P and other nutrients and energy No single technology alone can meet all these requirement and there is need for further research for in novating technologies that are capable to ensure optimal resource re covery with minimal cost and environmental footprint Considering P as a critical resource due to anticipated future scarcity focus should be given on technologies that are capable of recovering and recycling P and other nutrients Although some nutrient recovery and recycling techniques are already available further research should be done to as sess their environmental and economic feasibilities before large scale implementation Research should also aim at overcoming the limita tions of existing technologies as presented in Table Policymanagement interventions for

recovery are mostly absent Therefore based on the cur rent review this study recommends necessary interventions to ensure sustainable management of baby nappies to achieve P circular economy Although the primary focus of this study is to assess the potential for P recovery and recycling from used baby nappies the recommendations given focus on overall management of baby nappies to ensure recovery of other nutrients and to minimize its life cycle environmental footprints Such a holistic approach considering its sustainable management is missing from the available literature and this study likely to make a signicant contribution in this regard A brief description of the policy management strategies to ensure P circular economy of disposable baby nappies is provided as follows Solutions from the product and system redesign perspective to enable regeneration Most traditional design solutions have identi ed human excreta as a perishable waste stream where handling needs to be minimized due to odor rather than a nutrient stream that carries a nonrenewable nutri ent P Hence the solutions currently used consider the fastest and the most convenient removal of both the excreta and used by nappies from the human interface If the nutrient recovery is given precedence over stigma created around getting human excreta away at the earliest possible time there are different solutions that can be explored Our re view indicates that given the already available various types of biode gradable nappies in the market some even biodegradable and the availability of published literature on technologies for composting used biodegradable nappies for nutrient recovery there is a great po tential for such nappies in the future However necessary researchshould be conducted for assessing the life cycle environmental impact of biodegradable nappies before large scale production and implemen tation Product and system designs around biodegradable nappies could pave the way for achieving P circular economy of disposable baby nappies In this regard based on the current review and our under standing of the available information online a number of possible new design concepts are discussed along with their pros and cons as follows Designing for disposal through traditional human excreta collection and treatment in wastewater management system Considering the avail ability of other ushable hygiene products like ushable sanitary pads Butkovic Thomson and ushable wipes Atasa un and Bhat designing biodegradable ushable baby nappy products could be a reality in the near future Such used ushable nappies con taining baby excreta could be readily disposed through the toilet with other human wastes to be collected through the traditional method of wastewater collection treatment and nutrient recovery systems The main advantage is that it could be easily disposed into the toilet and there is no transportation cost and nuisance of odor However the main drawback is such design approach would not be compatible with existing infrastructure of urban wastewater management andsuch disposal might create huge burden on the existing wastewater management system The immediate recovery of P and other nutrients are also not possible through this method Disposal of ushable wipes has already been reported to cause severe problem of chokingblocking of sewer lines Patchell Therefore such design could be consid ered in future urban and wastewater infrastructure planning to make this compatible with increased loads However adequate research and risk analysis should be done to check the feasibility of implementing such system Designing for managing through the systematic collection and dis posal through natural processing This design concept require producing and using biodegradable nappies and systematic collection of the nappies after usage and disposing these to natureland for soil amend ment or improvement for future agriculture production Shredding of the wipes before placing these on the soil might help to degrade these quickly The main advantage of this method is that the nappies couldbe naturally decomposed for land improvement and nutrient recycling This also requires lower processing and treatment cost compared to theindustrial processingcomposting The main drawbacks would be nd ing suitable lands transportation cost depending on the distance of the location of lands nuisance of bad odor while transporting and ap plying on land and the time taken for degradation and decomposing on land The main advantage compared to the rst option above is that excreta as well as the nappy materials are recycled providing the ability of regeneration of P in excreta in used baby nappies Designing for systematic collection and disposal through industrial processing As explained in the previous option the production and use of biodegradable nappies are required for this design concept The used nappies containing baby excreta could be collected separately from the household and childcare centres and transported to indus trial facilities for processing and treatment to produce nutrient rich products like compost for agricultural use An initiative called DYCLE in Germany provides parents with a biobased nappy that is naturally degraded into soil and collects the used nappies for transforming into nutrient rich black soil for plant growth DYCLE The industrial composting has some advantages like handling of large volume of used nappy waste production of high qualitystable products removal of odor and quicker processingtreatment time Matter of Trust It is also possible to recover energy during industrial or commer cial scale composting Smith and Aber The high quality commer cial compost product could also be sold to the market as fertilizer for agricultural use Therefore this option provides the opportunity to re cover P as a nutrient in the excreta contained in baby nappies Some of the disadvantages of industrial processing are high establishment and operational cost waste transportation cost and energy use Designing for managing through traditional human excreta collec tion and treatment system or through naturalindustrial processing In this approach nappies could be designed in a way that have two layers one for holding the absorbing layer with body made of plastic or durablematerial and the other for absorbing the urine and feces which is made of completely biodegradable materials and could be re lled every time of use Some cloth nappies with a similar design concept are already available in the market eg AllinTwo style nappy Darlings Downunder The excreta containing layer can be ushed through the toilet or could be collected for natural or industrial processing and the other layer could be recyclable or washable and reused This ap proach could help to substantially reduce the volume of used baby nappy wastes while it is compatible with disposal through traditional wastewater management system or through natural or industrial pro cessing as explained above Designing for managing through household or community composting with food and garden waste and other organics In this design concept used biodegradable nappies could be composted at home and at community composting facilities mixing with food waste and garden waste Cocomposting of biodegradable baby nappies with other or ganic wastes has been found to produce good quality nutrient rich end products in a number of studies Tsigkou et al a Coln et al Coln et al Home composting has been identi ed to have a number of advantages like no collection and transportation cost minimum infrastructure and operational cost production of suit able nutrient rich compost for gardening and increasing community awareness and involvement in composting and waste management Barrena et al Vzquez and Soto However this method also has some limitations like nuisance of bad odor around household area and risk of pathogen borne disease if not properly handled Lle et al suggested that vermicomposting method could substan tially reduce the problem of bad odor It is essential to perform neces sary experiments and feasibility studies before promoting and implementing household composting of used baby nappiesRB Chowdhury and M Wijayasundara Science of the Total Environment All these possible design options explained above have the potential for helping towards achieving the P circular economy of disposable baby nappies However considering the pros and cons of each options as we discussed necessary life cycle and economic analysis should be per formed to understand the environmental and economic feasibility of each option Informed with the ndings of such analysis and necessary eld investigations the suitable option could be implemented depend ing upon the socioeconomic and environmental condition of the country Solutions from the overall life cycle management perspective Apart from considering solutions from the product and system de sign perspectives as stated above necessary planning should be done to ensure the sustainable management of baby nappies in its overall life cycle to ensure effective recovery of P and other nutrients As pre sented in Table this study proposes a conceptual plan that might be considered in this regard A snapshot of the key interventions required at different stages of the disposable baby nappy life cycle is presented inFig Interventions at the production and marketing stage Cordella et al suggests that careful selection and use of materials at the pro duction stage could reduce life cycle impacts of nappy products and as sociated human health and environmental risks For instance nappies produced using biodegradable materials could be suitable for nutrient recovery through composting Based on appropriate experiments Coln et al demonstrated the potential for used compostable biodegradable baby nappies for producing good quality compost fertil izers Tsigkou et al a developed new separation methods where the biodegradable part of the disposable used nappies could be separated from nonbiodegradable parts and codigested that with ex pired food waste to produce anaerobic sludge for composting to make suitable end product for land application Another study by Ferronato et al also separated organic fraction of the used disposable nappies and used that for vermicomposting with cow manure to produce suitable compost fertilizers A completely biodegradable nappy could ultimately reduce the burden of separation organic materials and thus could be readily used for compostingThere are already various types of biodegradable and ecofriendly nappies made of plantbased materials like maize bamboo available at a reasonable price in the market some of which are biodegrad able Khoo et al Use of such nappies need to be promoted among consumers through various awareness and marketing initiatives by producers retailers as well as the government Research suggests that the global biodegradable nappy made of cotton wool bamboostarch market likely to grow from worth US billion in to worth US billion by indicating strong growth mainly driven by increased awareness about personal hygiene and increased environ mental concerns Imarc Group It should however be noted that biodegradable materials sometimes are reported to have higher envi ronmental impact compared to the alternatives such as plastic Interventions at the householdcommunity stage At the house holdcommunity level it is necessary to enhance the awareness about the importance of recycling P and other nutrients in baby nappies to drive them towards using biodegradablecompostable nappies Based on an examination of the community participation in household solid waste HSW reduction in eastern Surabaya Indonesia Dhokhikah et al suggested a number of strategies eg intensifying the HSW reduction training programs intensifying the information dissem ination through mass media and campaign increasing the number of environmental cadres and optimizing the existence of waste bank and its function Community initiatives for using biodegradable nappies and collecting those nappies after use and composting utilizing appro priate methods would help to recover and recycle nappy bound nutri ents Local government councils could run tailored waste education awareness programs targeting households with babies to educate them on this matter Pickering et al suggests that educating res idents about the bene ts of organic waste diversion increases their be havioral intents for participation in the waste diversion program Initiatives for involving communities in sustainable management of dis posable nappy waste is already underway in some parts of the world eg the DYCLE initiative of Germany as mentioned before motivatesand supports parents to use compostable nappies through facilitating the collection of used nappies and converting into black soil for growing plants DYCLE Table A life cycle management plan for achieving phosphorus circular economy of disposable baby nappies Stages of baby nappy life cycleWhat needs to be achieved How to achieve

Interventions at the waste management stage Waste management is the crucial stage that determines the ultimate fate of the used babynappies How the used nappy wastes would be collected processed treated and disposed in turn determines the fate of baby excreta bound P and other nutrients trapped in those nappies In the traditional management system in many countries used nappies are usually ends up in land ll with other garbage resulting in the loss of a considerable amount of P and other valuable nutrients as we assessed for Australia in this study Although there are various types of resource recovery and recycling technologies or methods for used baby nappies are re ported in available literature as we reviewed in this study these are mostly at lab experiment or pilot project stage The capacity for the practical implementation of these techniques to a large scale is still lim ited mainly due to the lack of policies and regulations for the sustainable management of P and other valuable nutrients in used baby nappy wastes The recovery and recycling of a critical and nonrenewable nutrient resource like P from human excreta is usually ignored while the aim for managing human excreta is always to quickly keep away from human There is a need for shift in the way of peoples perception about it by recognising it as a valuable nutrient stream as it contains a substantial amount of nite element like P setting a clear goal for P and other nu trient recovery setting design goals particularly in relation to future urban planning to design a system compatible for P recovery and nd ing ways to manage tradeoffs Developing separate collection systems for used baby nappies as well as establishing both centralized and decentralized composting fa cilities could allow composting of used baby nappies Decentralized community composting of organic wastes is appearing as a promising solution for municipal solid waste management in Italy Bruni et al Pai et al assessed that decentralized community composting has potential social and economic bene ts along with envi ronmental advantages Local government authorities could take someinitiativesprograms on a trial basis to check the effectiveness of house hold and community composting of used baby nappies with food waste and garden organics and utilizing the compost products locally for home or community gardening Such initiatives have the potential for not only to divert wastes from land ll but also to reduce the waste transportation cost and associated environmental impacts There is also need for developing local markets for the compost products As currently given for other recycling industries the government could also consider providing nancial incentives and support to recycling indus tries and community groups trying to produce compost products utiliz ing used baby nappies The waste management authorities also need to enhance their capability for the largescale implementation of P recycling technologies of used disposable baby nappies to achieve a P circular economy Conclusions This study estimated that nearly tonne P was lost through the disposal of used disposable baby nappies to land lls in Australia over the period of The situation is more or less similar for other de veloped nations however such quantitative analysis is currently absent for nations emphasizing the need for a global assessment of P loss through disposable baby nappies This study revealed that although there are various types of technologiesmethods that offer nutrient recov e r yf r o mu s e db a b yn a p p

understand the effec tiveness before practically implementing to largeindustry scale There are also a wide range other technologiesmethods for recycling baby nappies with purpose ranging from energy recovery to volume reduction generation of pulp hydrogel cellulose and polymer as well as to increase yield stress and viscosity of concrete This study recommends that future research and innovation

technologies and methods that are capable to ensure optimum recovery of P and other resources with minimum adverse environmental impact and at a reasonable price The new product and system design options as well as interventions at the various stages of the nappy life cycle as proposed in this study could be utilized to achieve a P circular economy of baby nappies Options such as designing for ushing designing for disassembling the excreta containing part and designing for systematic collection storage and treatment through natural or industrial processing as well as through householdcommunity composting were evaluated along with pros and cons hence providing guidelines for future research needs In order to close the loop the study speci cally recommends for the design and production of biodegradable nappies using raw materials from bamboo and cotton plants that are fertilized through compost produced from disposable baby nappy wastes Overall consid ering the key interventions as suggested in this study a coordinated and harmonized effort is required from all the stakeholders involved at var ious stages of the nappy life cycle to ensure sustainable production
