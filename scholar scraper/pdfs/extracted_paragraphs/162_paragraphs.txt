The circular economy  concept  offers a viable pathway  to improve  resource  eﬃciency  and  recover value from food loss and waste. Although  China has made circular economy  a strategic  compo-   nent of its national  development  strategy,  it has faced multiple  barriers  which persisted  in the full-scale   implementation  of sustainable  food consumption  and production.  We aimed to empirically  investigate   these barriers,  based on data from three key stakeholder  groups in the food supply chains: the food  processors,  sales and distribution  ﬁrms, and consumers.  We quantiﬁed  the cause-and-effect  relationships   among barriers  by the fuzzy decision  making-trial  and evaluation  laboratory  analysis     technique.  All groups identify  weak enforcement  of environmental  regulations  and lack of environmental   education  and accountability  as key cause barriers  in China. Our results suggest that policy level changes   include enhanced  regulatory  attention,  and new educational  initiatives  will be required  in China. Man-  agers should focus on waste separation  and gaining economies  of scale. Together,  these initiatives  will  help promote  sustainable  consumption  and production  for a paradigm  shift to a circular agri-food  supply  chain system.  ©2 0 2 1 Institution  of Chemical  Engineers.

Introduction   To ensure sustainable  consumption  and production   pat-  terns is one of the 17 Sustainable  Development  Goals of the  United Nations.  “Sustainable  consumption  and production  is about  doing more and better with less. It is also about decoupling   economic  growth  from environmental  degradation,  increasing  re-  source eﬃciency  and promoting  sustainable  lifestyles” (  United Na-  tions, 2020 ). The food sector has been one of the focus areas for  making  the transition  to SCP patterns  because  the sector is respon-   sible for about 30% energy  consumption  and 22% greenhouse  gas  emissions  of the world . According  to the  Food and Agriculture  Organization, about one-third  of  the food produced  for human  consumption  (approximately  1.3 bil-  lion tons worth around  $1 trillion)  is lost or wasted  in food pro-  duction  and harvesting,  sales/distribution,  and consumption  stages  ∗Corresponding  author.

On the one hand, the world needs to re-  duce food loss and waste along the supply chain to meet the in-  creasing  consumption  needs of a growing  population  ( Parﬁtt et al.,  2010 ; Toop et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, the current  food waste  management  systems  need an overhaul  to maximize  value recov-  ery. Taking multiple  European  countries  as an example,  food waste  accounts  for about 60% of the total municipal  bio-waste,  which is  collected  separately  and treated  by composting  or anaerobic  diges-  tion with biogas production  .  However,  the rate of separated  bio-waste  collection  averaged  about  only 43% in 2017, and the remaining  bio-waste  was not sepa-  rated from other municipal  waste and thus lost for value recov-  ery . In many other coun-  tries including  China, food waste recycling  is much less developed   and food waste is often disposed  of together  with other municipal   waste and sent to landﬁlls.   The circular  economy   concept  can support  systemic   changes  required  to increase  implementation  of SCP measures  and  recover  value from valuable  food waste resources.  In recent years,  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.07.028   2352-5509/© 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.   Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   CE has been increasingly  recognized  as a more sustainable  alterna-   tive to the dominant  linear   economic   model  which offers a new and compelling   sustainability  perspective  . CE ﬁnds its  root in the concepts  of industrial  ecology,  biomimicry,  and cradle-   to-cradle  ( Yuan et al., 2006 ; McDonough  and Braungart,  2010 ;  Mentink,  2014 ). It is an innovative  industrial  ecosystem  that is  restorative  and regenerative  by design ( Ellen MacArthur  Founda-   tion, 2014 ). In CE, technical  materials     are designed  for recovery  (remanufacturing,  refurbishing,  and recy-  cling), and biological  materials    are safely returned  to the biosphere  to enhance  natural  capital.  By  circulating  the use of materials,  CE aims to improve  resource  eﬃ-  ciency with virtually  no creation  of waste ( Ellen MacArthur  Foun-  dation,  2014 ), in a way that will reduce costs of both resources  and  energy  as we shift towards  SCP . In a fully circu-  lar economy,  forward  supply chain operations,  recycling  activities,   and value recovery  from waste are powered  by renewable  energies,   so that materials  circularity  is achieved  without  creating  negative   environmental  footprint.  Such a vision, although  far from being a  reality, inspires  the world to move in the right direction.   Policymakers  and business  leaders  worldwide  have started  to  embrace  CE as an innovative  and more sustainable  economic   model. Several  major economies,  including  the European  Union,  China, and Japan, have made CE part of their regional/national  de-  velopment  strategy.  Organizations  including  Apple, Philips,  Coca-  Cola, and IKEA are committed  to CE to enhance  their sustainability   performance  to create value for their customers  and other stake-  holders.  In the agri-food  sector, taking the U.K. as an example,  it  could save annual landﬁll  cost by USD 1.1 billion if organic  food  wastes were kept out of landﬁlls.  Other beneﬁts  include  a reduc-  tion of greenhouse  gas emissions  by 7.4 million  tonnes each year,  electricity  generation  of up to 2 GWh each year through  waste-  to-electricity  technologies,  and organic  compost  to restore  soil fer-  tility . The world is in a dire  need to ﬁght environmental  degradation  and to reduce greenhouse   gas emissions  to combat  climate  change.  Therefore,  it is of strategic   importance  to implement  CE principles  in food waste management.   Despite  these potential  beneﬁts  to SCP in the agri-food  sec-  tor, it is not clear how progress  can be made in developing  and  embedding  CE principles  into the industry  due to the presence   of multiple  barriers.  These sustainability  barriers  are often inter-  twined,  so it is diﬃcult  to divide and address  them sequentially   . In  addition,  studies  of food waste management  have mainly  focused   on the consumption  stage . Similarly,  stud-  ies of barriers  to sustainable  food waste management  have also fo-  cused on the consumption  stage, for example,  do Carmo Stangher-   lin and de Barcellos   and Lazell  . Although  substan-   tial environmental  impacts  from food loss and waste also occur  in the food processing  and sales/distribution  stages ( United Na-  tions, 2020 ), no study has systematically  investigated  sustainability   barriers  in these stages along with those in the consumption  stage  in the context  of China. It has been widely acknowledged  that sup-  ply chains should be studied  as systems  as a supply chain player’s   behavior  and performance  are inﬂuenced  by those of other players,   which is evidential  in the bullwhip  effect . SCP re-  quire collaboration  and close coordination  among  multiple  supply  chain actors . Therefore,  it is essential  to em-  ploy a systems  approach  to investigate  its implementation  barriers.   Our results narrow  the knowledge  gap by investigating  barriers   across multiple  stakeholders  in the forward  supply chain, includ-   ing food processors,  sales/distribution  channels,  and consumers.  It  provides  a more holistic  and systematic  view to help overcome  the  barriers  to sustainable  food consumption  and production  from a CE  perspective  focusing  on value recovery  from food loss and waste. In contrast  to earlier works which tended  to study challenges  as  isolated  ones at the consumption  stage, this research  investigates   sustainability  barriers  in the context  of the larger supply chain  system  in which an actor is embedded  in. Applying  such systems   thinking  can help uncover  the interdependency  among  system  ac-  tors and provide  deeper  understanding  in the root causes of com-  plex problems.  Therefore,  it can better predict  behaviors  and, ulti-  mately,  adjust their outcomes  . Given that waste  disposal  behaviors  vary in different  cultures,  there is a need to  study barriers  in speciﬁc  regional  and cultural  settings  to take into  account  the effect of regions/cultures.   The context  of this study is China, the largest developing  coun-  try that has both great need and commitment  to implement  CE.  The insights  offered  from the research  are not only applicable  to  agri-food  businesses  and their supply chain operations  in China but  also shed light on similar  operations  in many other economies  that  struggle  with a transition  to sustainable  food consumption  and  production.  The research  addresses  the following  research  ques-  tions:  • What are the key barriers  hindering  sustainable  food consump-   tion and production  for transitioning  to a CE in China?   • How can the interdependency  between  the barriers  be uncov-   ered for identifying  and overcoming  the root cause barriers?   This research  answers  the ﬁrst question  by identifying  a list  of important  barriers  based on literature  and insights  from the  Chinese  agri-food  sector. The multiple  barriers  inﬂuence  decision-   makers  and suggest  that a multi-criteria  decision-making  model    would be valuable  . It ad-  dresses  the second  question  by utilizing  the Fuzzy decision-making   trial and evaluation  laboratory  technique  ,  to  systematically  analyze  the complicated  interdependency  between   barriers.  Fuzzy DEMATEL  is a fuzzy set extension  to the stan-  dard DEMATEL  technique  . In compar-   ison with standard  DEMATEL,  Fuzzy DEMATEL  is more advanta-   geous because  it can address  the inherent  vagueness,  bias and un-  certainty  in human  judgments  which are part of the concerned  re-  search phenomenon  . Its method-   ological  procedures  are similar  to grey-based  DEMATEL,  another   widely used variation  to the standard  DEMATEL  .  We used Fuzzy DEMATEL  because  it has greater  capacity  than  grey-based  DEMATEL  in handling  vagueness.  Fuzzy DEMATEL  uses  three-dimensional  triangular  fuzzy numbers   (e.g., 0, 0.25,  0.75) , while grey-based  DEMATEL  uses two-  dimensional  grey numbers   to represent  the linguistic   variables.  Based on the ﬁndings  from the Fuzzy DEMATEL  analysis,   we discuss  managerial  and policy implications  on how the barriers   can be addressed.   The rest of the paper is organized  as follows.  Section  2 re-  views relevant  literature.  Section  3 describes  the methodology   and data collection  procedure.  Section  4 presents  the results and  analysis.  Section  5 discusses  managerial  and policy implications.   Section  6 concludes  the research.   2. Literature  review   2.1. Food waste management  and sustainable  consumption  and  production   The United Nations  Environmental  Program   de-  ﬁnes SCP as “the use of services  and related  products,  which re-  spond to basic needs and bring a better quality  of life while min-  imizing  the use of natural  resources  and toxic materials  as well  as the emissions  of waste and pollutants  over the life cycle of  the service  or product  so as not to jeopardize  the needs of fu-  ture generations”.   deﬁnes  food losses as “the decrease   1115  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   in edible food mass throughout  the part of the supply chain that  speciﬁcally  leads to edible food for human  consumption” ,  which take place at production,  postharvest  and processing  stages  in the food supply chain. Food waste is deﬁned  as “food losses oc-  curring  at the end of the food chain (retail and ﬁnal consump-   tion)” . Food loss and waste reduction  is the major global  economic  and political  agenda  as one third of globally  produced   food is lost or wasted  in the food chain .  This is especially  becoming  imperative  amidst  the call for explor-   ing the connection  between  food waste generation  and waste man-  agement  under the broader  framework  of sustainable  production   and consumption . In the food systems,   SCP face many issues due to complex  interdependency  in a web  of political,  institutional,  and technological  factors ( Heller and Ke-  oleian, 2003 ; Papargyropoulou  et al., 2014 ). It is also closely  linked  to their value chain governance  patterns  . It  is also imperative  to recognize  the food categories  with high envi-  ronmental  intensity  . Some of the other  unique  challenges  that food supply chains face include  frequent   production  setups,  strict regulations,  perishability,  storage  condi-  tion requirements,  transport  damages,  processing  loss, contamina-   tion, and recycling  issues ( Al-Ansari  et al., 2015 ; Behzadi  et al.,  2018 ; Sonesson  et al., 2016 ; Matzembacher  et al., 2020 ). These  challenges  are further  escalated  by widespread  growth  and struc-  tural shift in the food consumption  pattern  of urban and ru-  ral consumers  and more challenge  is to have the conceptual  un-  derstanding  on the nature of food wastes and their treatment   . Hence,  there is a growing  need to theorize  sustainable  food supply chains  .  Food waste management  is one of the key challenges  in sus-  tainable  food consumption  and production  ( Garcia-Herrero  et al.,  2018 ). As mentioned  earlier,  food loss and waste account  for about  one-third  of the global food production,  equal to 1.3 billion tons  per year. A few studies  reported  the magnitude  of food losses and  wastes in the production  and consumption  stages with respect   to developed  and developing  countries  ( Smil, 2004 ; Parﬁtt et al.,  2010 ; Gustavsson  et al., 2011 ). Their causes are diverse  ( Buzby and  Hyman,  2012 ; Girotto  et al., 2015 ; Luo et al., 2021 ). Some prod-  uct wastes are not suitable  for consumption;  they need to undergo   re-processing  for value recovery  .  Some even pose environmental  threats  and hygiene  problems   . Besides,  it is diﬃcult  to track or separate   the costs from the perspective  of organization  that generates  the  waste . In the meantime,  new technologies    and enhanced  collaboration  may support  ﬁrms  to address  these threats  and recover  more value .  Lately, literature  shows interest  in developing  strategies  to manage   those products    effectively,  as they are recognized  as an  alternative  way to food supply . However,  the  available  studies  appear  to be biased towards  the quantiﬁcation  of  wastes and losses by projecting  them as a negative  phenomenon   . Amidst  this, researchers  demand  the need  for fresh perspectives  of food waste generation  studies  from multi-  stakeholder  perspectives  .  In China alone, the annual food waste is in the range of 200  billion Chinese  Renminbi   . The loss of  grains   in the entire supply chain is about  19.0 ±5.8%, with the consumption  stage being the single largest  source of food waste . The estimated  loss in storage,  pro-  cessing,  and distribution  is 8%, 2.6 %, and 3%, respectively.  This  level of waste is equivalent  to about 135 billion m 3 of water foot-  print, and about 26 million  hectares  of land being cultivated  in  vain . Besides,  the post-harvest  stage contributes   around  35 million  tons wastage  in storage  mainly  due to fungi, ro-  dents, and insects  . Additionally,  there are some signiﬁcant  process-   ing, transportation,  and distribution  losses in the system  ( Liu and  Bai, 2014 ).  2.2. CE oriented  food loss and waste management   The CE concept  offers a new perspective  to sustainable  food  loss and waste management  as it considers  wastes as resources   for value recovery  . As mentioned  earlier,  di-  verting  organic  food wastes from landﬁlls  could generate  tremen-   dous economic  and environmental  beneﬁts  ( Ellen MacArthur  Foun-  dation,  2013 ). In a recent study, Santagata  et al.  summa-   rize the challenges  and opportunities  of food waste recovery  in  CE. The research  on food value chain primarily  on the produc-   tion, business  and industry  trends.  The focus on transition  to-  wards a circular  economy  is topical on food value chain and waste  literature,  till recently  the focus has been mostly on consumers   . At the policy level, it is the part of  Farm-to-Fork  strategy  proposed  by the circular  economy  package   as a part of global initiative  ). However,  such  a mission  requires  a systems  approach  because  food loss and waste  occur at multiple  stages along the supply chain including  agricul-   tural production,  postharvest  handling  and storage,  processing,  dis-  tribution,  and consumption  . The multiple  sub-systems   and components  mean that integrated  decision  making  is crucial  . Therefore,  CE  oriented  food loss and waste management  requires  close coordina-   tion of supply chain actors including  farmers,  bread producers,  re-  tailers, compostable  manufacturers,  insect breeders,  livestock  farm-  ers, and consumers  . Its ﬁrst step is to collect  and sort a large variety  of food wastes eﬃciently  from spatially   dispersed  sources.  Afterwards,  food wastes are treated  by appro-  priate value recovery  options.  Efforts should be made by managers   to reduce resource  use and waste by carefully  assessing  supplier   capabilities  and their supply network  to ensure waste is not only  avoided  at their facilities  but also at other facilities  along the sup-  ply chain . Throughout  these effort s, there remain   challenges  for ﬁrms that wish to transition  to a proﬁtable  CE busi-  ness model, with many barriers  (e.g., customer  behavior  or ﬁnan-  cial limitations  and constraints)  that are outside  of the manage-   rial control  . In a study, de Sadeleer   et al.  analyzed  the performance  of transition  into CE and  waste prevention  through  recycling  and energy  recovery.   2.3. Barriers  to CE implementation  in China  Despite  of a promising  vision, CE implementation  faces a vari-  ety of barriers.  Govindan  and Hasanagic   , Tura et al.  ,  and De Jesus and Mendonça   provided  general  classiﬁcations   of CE implementation  barriers.  Given that CE implementation  bar-  riers are context  speciﬁc,  most barrier  studies  focused  on a speciﬁc   region/country.  For example,  Kirchherr  et al.,  investigated   barriers  in the European  Union, and Mont et al.  focused  on  the Sweden  context.  This subsection  reviews  barriers  to CE imple-  mentation  in China which is the context  of this study.  CE implementation  in China has been driven by government   agencies  such as the National  Development  Reform  Commission     and Ministry  of Environmental  Protection  ( Mathews  and  Tan, 2016 ; Geng et al., 2014 ;). However,  China’s  progress  in CE im-  plementation  has been modest  due to the persistence  of many bar-  riers . Further,  Su et al.   analyzed  CE implementation  barriers  including  lack of in-  centive  schemes  for CE projects,  absence  of high-end  technology   towards  CE practices,  complex  institutional  structures  and issues  of local administration  coordination,  less ﬁnancing  options,  lack of  transparency,  and absence  of region-wise  customized  performance   1116  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   monitoring  system.   discussed  barriers  includ-   ing the absence  of a holistic  vision, overemphasis  on recycling,   and underuse  of reuse and reduce methods.  From institutional  per-  spectives,  Liu and Bai  recognized  a gap between  awareness   about CE practices  and its implementation  due to structural,  con-  textual,  and cultural  issues. These issues are unique  to organiza-   tions and regions  .  Yuan  identiﬁed  that inadequate  regulatory  environment,   multiple  stakeholder  involvement,  absence  of basic data, and low  level of attention  to waste management  caused  obstruct  the CE  projects  in a signiﬁcant  way. This also appears  to be a major  issue of production  and consumption  stages. In a recent study,  Zhang et al.  reported  that the key barriers  to smart waste  management  for a CE in China were the lack of regulatory  pres-  sures and the lack of environmental  education  and culture  of envi-  ronmental  protection.  Focusing  on the holistic  supply chain man-  agement,  Farooque  et al.   identiﬁed  the key barriers  to cir-  cular food supply chains in China were “weak environmental  reg-  ulations  and enforcement”,  “Lack of market  preference/pressure” and “Lack of collaboration/support  from supply chain actors”.  Ex-  tending  this insight,  Ranta et al.  elucidated  and compared   the institutional  barriers  of CE economy  in China, the US, and Eu-  rope. The study recognized  the difference  of the normative  be-  haviour  of the Chinese  environment  than other regions  and at-  tribute CE performance  in China to its large informal  sector and  low-level  regulation  with less enforcement.  On the other hand, it  argued  that the US lacks nation-wide  stringent  regulation  support-   ing CE and Europe  supports  CE with high level source-separation   activities  and clear institutional  environment.  In a speciﬁc  study  with respect  to Norway,  Jaegar and Upadhyay   identiﬁed   product  design and production  and high start-up  costs are key bar-  riers to CE environments.  In Sweden,  the CE activities  show less  incentive  alignment  and lack proﬁt focus ( Eriksson  et al., 2016 ;  Johansson  and Henriksson,  2020 ). In addition,  complexity  of pro-  cedures  and high legal/regulatory  compliance  costs appear  to be  the signiﬁcant  barriers  in Europe  .  On other hand, China considers  recyclables  as valuables  instead  of  waste; yet, their region-speciﬁc  CE norms appear  to be a potential   barrier  to CE implementation.   Weak legal enforcement   in China has  continued.  Despite  rapid economic  expansion,  the deteriorating  en-  vironment  has undermined  the local standard  of living. China’s  En-  vironmental  Protection  Law was updated  in 2015, including  stricter   punishments  on polluters.  Related  initiatives  have yielded  signiﬁ-   cant results,  especially  in air, water, and soil pollution.  However,   food loss and waste is not a heavy polluting  sector so it has been  excluded  from the environmental  protection  related  laws. Similarly,   while China’s  Circular  Economy  Promotion  Law was amended  in  2018, there are no provisions  on food loss and waste. While food  loss and waste reduction  can contribute  to the carbon  emission,   food sector was not included  in China’s  carbon  neutrality  strategy.   The most related  law is the Anti-food  Waste Law (issued  in April  2021), intended  to enhance  food security.  However,  many citizens   are not aware of the newly enacted  law, the ﬁnes are not high, and  the measurements  are not clear, suggesting  there will be weak en-  forcement.   Agri-food  products  face unique  challenges  for transitioning  to  a CE . Overall,  the food recycling  system  in  China is weak due to poor infrastructure  for collection  and in-  adequate  treatment  facilities.  Unsorted  food wastes are mainly   sent to landﬁlls.  Only in large cities like Shanghai  and Beijing,  a  small portion  of food waste is separated  at sources  and treated   by biochemical  processes  . In recent years, in-  terest in food waste recycling  has been growing  ( Wen et al.,  2016 ). Zhang et al.  advocated  the use of waste cooking   oil as an energy  resource.  Converting  food waste to energy  is in line with the interest  of the government  to reduce the demand   for petroleum  products  and natural  gas ( Liang and Zhang, 2012 ;  Li et al., 2012 ). Woon and Lo  proposed  the use of gen-  eral food wastes as a potential  resource  for generating  electricity   and city gas in Hong Kong. Some agri-food  wastes such as potato  vines, peanut  shells, wild plants, and household  wastes are con-  verted into useful products  such as biomass,  biodiesel,  and ani-  mal and ﬁsh feed as they are nutrient-rich  with organic  matter  . All these studies  on food waste  recycling  focused  on technologies  and practices.  They offer little  insights  into the related  implementation  barriers,  which are cru-  cial for understanding  why they not been commercialized  in the  domestic  market.   2.4. Theoretical  background   The research  draws on the combined  perspectives  of stake-  holder theory and theory of reasoned  actions   at the ﬁrm  level to explore  the challenges  of food waste management.  The  stakeholder  theory underscores  the responsibility  of fulﬁlling  both  internal  and external  participants’  expectations  .  In the current  context,  it helps explain  the reasons  for barriers   to sustainable  food consumption  and production  that involve  ac-  tors or stakeholders  of varied characteristics  and behaviors  such as  processors,  wholesalers,  traders,  distribution  channel  partners,  e-  retailers,  and consumers.  The theory offers deliberations  on multi-  stakeholder  engagement  and governance  that are imperative  to  the food processing  industry  and contribute  to designing  and co-  creation  processes  in ensuing  sustainability  across food chains  . Besides,  it provides  normative  explanations   of why and what ways ﬁrms should consider  stakeholder  views in  implementing  sustainable  and production-consumption  strategies.   The theory also supports  incorporating  the stakeholders’  views for  visioning  and participatory  exercises  that lead to decision  mak-  ing within the CE and waste management  system  ( Vergragt  and  Quist, 2011 ).  The power of TRA is beﬁtting  to explain  the ﬁrm’s readiness   for adopting  CE principles  in waste management  ( Fishbein  and  Ajzen, 1975 ). The theory helps to ﬁnd out the reasons  of  behavioural  attitudes  of stakeholders  towards  particular  phe-  nomenon,  as it is recognized  as the moral responsibility  of stake-  holders  . TRA helps to under-  stand the individual  actions  and consumption  patterns  to design  policy and promote  the sustainable  waste management  practices   integrating  CE elements.  Speciﬁcally,  it helps to explore  the atti-  tude under the conditions  of volitional  control  and predicts  the  intentions,  which explicates  willingness  or readiness  to engage  a  speciﬁc  task in environmental  sustainability  .  Besides,  it decodes  interactions  between  barriers  of SCP focus-  ing on inter and intra organizational  subjective  norms,  which is  about the speciﬁc  behavior  under external  stakeholders’  pressure   . Thus, it is helpful  to study the com-  mitment  and readiness  to CE through  the ﬁtting production  and  consumption  processes.   2.5. Barrier study techniques   In complex  environments,  effective  decision-making  is highly  dependent  on the analysis  of interdependency  between  the deci-  sion variables  interacting  within the system.  The DEMATEL  tech-  nique  has become  increasingly  popular   in analyzing  those interactions  . Other relevant   multi-criteria  decision-making  tools include  Interpretive  Structural   Modelling  , Analytic  Hierarchy  Process  , Analytic  Net-  work Process  , and Structural  Equation  Modelling  . (Re-  fer Table 1 ).  1117  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al.

ANP uncovers   interdependencies   between  and among the  variables.  It is less  accepted  for barrier  studies due to its  complexity.  SEM is mainly used for  theoretical  development   and it requires a large  sample size.  Source: Adopted from Venkatesh  et al.,  and Mangla et al.  .  The DEMATEL  technique  not only establish  relationships  but  also elucidate  the overall degree of inﬂuence  of the study factors  . Centered  on graph theory,  the tech-  nique can accommodate  heterogeneous  factors ( Li and Wan, 2014 ;  Benyoucef  et al., 2014 ) and does not require  a large amount  of data.  It visualizes  the causal relationships  through  the impact-relations   map or causal-effect  diagram,  where the techniques  differentiate   causal and effect groups  separately  . The  DEMATEL  technique  was judged  to be most suitable  to address   the research  questions  proposed  earlier because  it is a good ﬁt  for uncovering  the causal relationships  between  system  variables   . As mentioned  earlier,  we employed  Fuzzy DE-  MATEL,  an advanced  variant  of the standard  DEMATEL  technique   to address  the inherent  vagueness,  bias and uncertainty  in human   judgments  . There is a wide range  of research  reports  that applied  fuzzy logic studies  with DEMATEL   . Some of the recent DEMATEL  studies  in the sustain-   able production  consumption  domain  include  Deng et al.  ,  Sivakumar  et al.  , Bhatia and Srivastava   , Kumar and  Dixit  , Liu et al.  , Singhal  et al.  , etc.  Summarizing  the literature  review,  food waste management  is  a key challenge  in SCP. The CE concept  offers a viable pathway  to  sustainable  food consumption  and production  by treating  wastes as  resources  for value recovery.  A wide range of barriers  to CE imple-  mentation  have been identiﬁed  in the extant literature,  but there  is a lack of study of speciﬁc  barriers  in food waste management  in  China. This signiﬁcant  knowledge  gap will be addressed  in the fol-  lowing  sections.  Besides,  DEMATEL  technique  has not been widely  applied  in the CE studies,  although  it has been widely used and  reported  in closed-loop  or conventional  reverse  supply chain, and  energy  studies  in recent times ( Büyüközkan  and Güleryüz,  2016 ;  Çelikbilek  and Tüysüz,  2016 ).  3. Methodology   The study follows  a two-step  process.  The ﬁrst step is to elu-  cidate the barrier  list. In the second  step, these barriers  are sub-  jected to fuzzy DEMATEL  technique  in the following  step to draw  causal-effect  maps. The following  sub-sections  describe  the meth-  ods in detail.  3.1. Finalizing  the study barriers   Based on the recent literature,  the researchers  compiled  a list  of thirteen  barriers  to sustainable  food consumption  and produc-   tion in China with a focus on value recovery  from wastes from  a CE perspective.  The list was reviewed  by three senior govern-   ment oﬃcials  who were in charge of municipal  waste manage-   ment and new government  initiatives  in sustainability,  four busi-  ness managers  who had responsibilities  over supply chain opera-  tions in food processors  and retailers,  and two scholars  in the ﬁeld  .  They  were asked to comment  on the validity  of the barriers  in the Chi-  nese context  and whether  any important  barrier  is missed  out. A concern  was raised that practitioners  may have diﬃculty  to distin-  guish several  barriers  in the initial list, because  they were regarded   as too closely  related  to each other. Based on their feedback,  the  thirteen  barriers  were merged  into nine barriers  that are distinc-   tively different  from each other. For example,  low margin  in value  recovery  from food waste was considered  as intertwined  with high  collection  and transportation  cost, and therefore  they were com-  bined as cost barrier.  According  to their suggestion,  a new barrier   was added into the list which was lack of benchmarking  and rel-  evant standards  in China. The resulting  ﬁnal list of ten barriers  is  described  as follows.   B1 - Weak legal enforcement:  Like many other developing   countries,  China lacks a comprehensive  and effective  legal sys-  tem for environmental  protection  and the enforcement  of laws is  weak ( Borrello  et al., 2016 ; Govindan  and Hasanagic,  2018 ; Li and  Yu, 2011 ). Despite  China’s  ambitious  CE vision and current  environ-   mental  laws, the implementation  end enforcement  has faced many  diﬃculties  which are intertwined  with resource  implications,  mon-  itoring mechanisms,  and potential  impacts  on business  operations   and economic  development.   B2 - Inadequate  infrastructure:  Waste sorting  at source is  a precondition  for maximizing  value recovery  from food waste  . Unfortunately,  most Chinese  cities do not  have adequate  infrastructure  to support  refuse classiﬁcation.  In July  2019, Shanghai,  the largest city in China, started  to implement   compulsory  waste sorting.  However,  it is lagging  in food waste  processing  capacities.  Overall,  there is not enough  separated  bins  for diverse  types of garbage  and the waste management  system  is  weak in China , especially  in its less devel-  oped regions.   B3 - Behavioural  barrier:  Most Chinese  do not have the habit  of rubbish  sorting  due to various  cultural  and historical  reasons.   They are used to mixing  all garbage  types and throwing  them away  altogether  for convenience  . In addition,  it is part  of the traditional  Chinese  culture  for a host to prepare/order  more  than enough  foods, which is perceived  as a symbol  of prosperity.   Many Chinese  hosts feel embarrassed  if their guests ﬁnish all the  served foods, because  they feel “losing  face” if  their guests do not  get enough  to eat. Therefore,  food waste is commonplace  at social  events in China.  B4 –L a c k of investment  in advanced  equipment/technologies:   Value recovery  from food loss and waste requires  signiﬁcant  up-  front investment  in advanced  equipment/technologies.  Lack of ﬁ-  nancial  resources  is widely acknowledged  as a barrier  to support   CE implementation  . In China, food  processors  and municipal  waste management  departments  often  employ  contractors  to manage  waste collection  and further  pro-  cessing  activities.  Such contractors  are often small and medium   sized enterprises  which do not have a lot of ﬁnancial  resources  to  invest in advanced  food waste processing  equipment/technologies.   B5 - Lack of expertise:  CE is a relatively  new concept,  so there is  a lack of expertise  to support  its implementation  ( Kaur et al., 2018 ;  Borrello  et al., 2016 ). Food waste as a bio-based  resource  requires   specialized  competence  and knowledge  for value recovery  opera-  1118  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al.

At present,  there are very limited  training  courses  and study  programs  in China on CE and sustainable  food waste management.   Consequently,  there is a shortage  of expertise  for a variety  of so-  phisticated  food waste treatment  options.   B6 - Lack of cross-sector  collaboration:  Lack of sup-  port/collaboration  from other sectors  can be a serious  obstacle  to  a transition  to CE , because  it is often not  realistic  for a same sector to reuse all its wastes.  For example,   some food wastes can be used to produce  animal  feeds, com-  post, or energy,  but they require  substantial  initial investments   and long-term  cross-sector  collaboration  between  food waste  producers/collectors  and potential  users to be economically  vi-  able. Unsurprisingly,  lack of cross-sector  collaboration  is a barrier   which hinders  the implementation  of CE principles  in food waste  management.   B7 - Cost barrier:  There is a low margin  in value recovery  from  food wastes and a high cost for food waste collection  and trans-  portation  .  Therefore,  food waste management  is not necessarily  proﬁtable   depending  on whether  the operating  costs can be fully offset by  the economic  gains or not. Due to cost considerations,  a waste  management  business  may not want to take certain  types of food  wastes which have lower economic  beneﬁts.  Apparently,  there ex-  ists a cost barrier  to achieving  maximum  environmental  beneﬁts   by collecting  and processing  all food wastes.   B8 - Lack of economies  of scale: There is a lack of  the economies  of scale in collecting  and processing  food  wastes for value recovery  ( Borrello  et al., 2016 ; Govindan  and  Hasanagic,  2018 ; Sauvé et  al., 2016 ), especially  for household   food wastes.  Household  food waste is spatially  dispersed  and the  amount  collectable  from each residential  community  is usually  not  much. Such a lack of economies  of scale disincentivizes  sustainable   food waste management  for value recovery.   B9: Lack of environmental  education  and accountability:  In  the past few decades,  there was very limited  education  on envi-  ronmental  protection  in China. Consequently,  many Chinese  citi-  zens have little care or awareness  about the environmental  im-  pacts of food loss and waste . In recent years,  the Chinese  government  stepped  up environmental  education,  but  the effect of the old mindset  is persistent,  especially  among  the  older generations.  The current  environmental  education  system  fo-  cuses more on professional  education  and relatively  ignores  the  non-professional  education  that would inﬂuence  day-to-day  con- sumption  and business-oriented  behavior  relating  to food wastes  . In addition,  there is often a lack of account-   ability for environmental  damages  except for major environmental   disasters.   B10: Lack of benchmarking  and standards:  There are diﬃcul-   ties in ﬁnding  benchmarking  enterprises  or practices  for sustain-   able food loss and waste management  as China’s  progress  toward   a CE is still modest  . There is also a lack of  national  and industry  standards  for collecting  and processing  food  wastes.  Overall,  food waste management  as a sector is still at an  early stage of adopting  sustainability  practices  in China.  The researchers  designed  a questionnaire  in English  to cap-  ture the opinions  of evaluators  for Fuzzy DEMATEL  analysis.  The  questionnaire  was then translated  into the Chinese  language,  in-  cluding  an explanation  of each barrier  to guide the evaluators.   Two researchers  who are bilingual  in English  and Chinese  checked   the translation  to ensure accuracy.  The researchers  conducted  two  rounds  of pilot tests with nine expert evaluators  to get feedback  on  the questionnaire  design.  Based on their feedback,  the researchers   revised  the questionnaire  to ensure content  validity  by eliminating   ambiguity  and possible  confusion.   The ﬁnalized  questionnaire  was distributed  by email or post  to be anonymously  completed  by potential  evaluators  in three  groups:  food processors  (food processing/manufacturing  compa-   nies), sales and distribution  channels  (supermarkets,  import/export   businesses,  e-retailers,  and wholesalers),  and consumers.  Each  group had 100 potential  evaluators  received  the questionnaire,  so  in total the questionnaire  reached  300 potential  evaluators.  For  the evaluators  from the industry  sectors,  we employed  a purpo-   sive/judgmental  sampling  approach   to target  those who are most knowledgeable  on the subject.  We only in-  vited participations  from senior executives/managers/supply  chain  heads and business  owners.  This was to ensure the quality  of the  data and the validity  of the results.  The data collection  was sup-  ported by three branches  of a regional  government  in northern   China, namely,  the Development  and Reform  Commission,  the Bu-  reau of Commerce,  and Food Safety Committee.  For responses  from  consumers,  a convenience  sampling  method  was adopted.  A total  of 210 questionnaires  were returned  from three groups  of evalua-   tors, among  which 117 complete  responses  were considered  valid  for the Fuzzy DEMATEL  analysis.  Tables 2 and 3 show the proﬁle  of these 117 evaluators.   1119  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   3.2. DEMATEL  Analysis   In this research,  we apply the fuzzy DEMATEL  technique  using  the following  steps to analyze  the barriers  to sustainable  food con-  sumption  and production.  Venkatesh  et al.  explained  in de-  tails the technical  procedures  of the Fuzzy DEMATEL  technique.   Step 1. Constituting  the expert panel / focused  group and ﬁnaliz-   ing the decision  variables   Step 2. Structuring  a pairwise  comparison  matrix  In this step, each decision-maker  was asked to ﬁnalize  the de-  gree to which a factor i affects factor j using the scale from 0 to 4  (0 = no inﬂuence,  1 = very low inﬂuence,  2 = low inﬂuence,  3 = high  inﬂuence,  and 4-very high inﬂuence).  A sample  of pairwise  com-  parison  is shown in Appendix  A .  Step 3. Finalizing  the fuzzy initial direct relation  matrix   The TFN is represented  by a triplet, i.e. . Suppose   x k  ij = e k  ij , f k  ij , g k  ij where 1 ≤k ≤K, to be the fuzzy evaluation  that  the k th expert gives about the degree to which barrier  i have an  impact  on barrier  j. If ‘K’ is the number  of participants  in our  study to estimate  causality  between  the identiﬁed  n study barri-  ers, inputs given by the participants  result in a n ×n matrix i.e.  X k = x k  ij ; where, k = 1, 2, 3 4...n (number  of experts  in a decision   panel).  A sample  of fuzzy initial direct relation  matrix is shown in  Appendix  B .  a ij = 1  k /summationtext x kij   Followed  by that, the defuzziﬁcation  process  is used to convert   the fuzzy numbers  to crisp numbers,  as those fuzzy numbers  are  not appropriate  for the matrix operations.  We defuzzify  the fuzzy  initial direct relation  matrix using the below equation    I T = 1  6    A sample  average  initial direct-relation  crisp matrix  for the  food processor  group is shown in Appendix  C .

A factor falls  into the causal group if it shows a positive   value. A bar-  rier is classiﬁed  into the effect group if its  value is negative   .  4. Results  and analysis   The following  section  presents  Fuzzy DEMATEL  analysis  results.   The total-relation  matrices  for three evaluator  groups  are provided   in Tables 4 , 6 and 8 respectively  and they quantify  the impact  rela-  tionships  between  all the barriers.  The R + C and R-C scores for each  evaluator  category  are presented  in Tables 5 , 7 and 9 respectively   along with the evaluators’  importance  rankings  and Fuzzy DEMA-   TEL based rankings.  Moreover,  cause-effect  diagrams  are developed   for each evaluator  group separately  and presented  as Fig.s 1 , 2 and  3 . The signiﬁcant  relationships  between  barriers  are also mapped   on the cause-effect  diagrams  by arrows  to highlight  their interde-   pendence.  We mapped  the signiﬁcant  relationships  (highlighted  as  bold values)  above a threshold  value  calculated  by adding  1.5  standard  deviations  to the mean of the total-relation  matrix ,  following  Li and Tzeng  ’s recommendations  on using appro-  priate threshold  levels.  4.1. Fuzzy DEMATEL  results of the food processors   Fuzzy DEMATEL  analysis  results of the ﬁrst evaluator  group (i.e.,  food processors)  are presented  in Table 4 , Table 5 and Fig. 1 . From  these results,  we observe  that weak legal enforcement  , lack  of investment  in advanced  equipment/technologies  , lack of  expertise  , lack of economies  of scale  and lack of en-  vironmental  education  and accountability   are identiﬁable  as  the cause barriers  from the food processors’  perspective.  However,   by looking  at the interrelationships  of the barriers  presented  in  Fig. 1 and Table 6 , B1, B8 and B9 appear  to be the key cause bar-  riers, while B1 has a directly  signiﬁcant  impact  on B10 and B2 re-  spectively.  Similarly,  B4, B5 and B2 have a high R + C score, respec-   tively, suggesting  these are the most inﬂuential  barriers  to sustain-   able food loss management  from the food processors’  perspective.   4.2. Fuzzy DEMATEL  results of the sales and distribution  channels   Similarly,  Tables 6 and 7 and Fig. 2 present  the Fuzzy DEMATEL   analysis  results of the second  evaluator  group (i.e., sales and distri-  bution channels).  Weak legal enforcement  , lack of investment   in advanced  equipment/technologies  , lack of cross-sector  col-  laboration  , cost barrier  , lack of environmental  education   and accountability   and lack of benchmarking  and standards    are identiﬁed  as the cause barriers  from distribution  chan-  nels’ perspective.  However,  by looking  at the interrelationships  of  the barriers  presented  in Fig. 2 and Table 8 , B1, B9, and B7 are  identiﬁed  as the most signiﬁcant  cause barriers,  while B1 and B7  have a signiﬁcant  direct impact  on B3 and B2 respectively.  Simi-  larly, B2, B7 and B1 have a high R + C score, respectively,  suggesting   these as the most inﬂuential  barriers  to sustainable  food loss and  waste management  from sales and distribution  channel’s  perspec-   tive.  4.3.

However,   by looking  at the interrelationships  of the barriers  presented  in  Fig. 3 and Table 9 , B1 and B9 appear  to be the key cause barriers,   while B1 has a directly  signiﬁcant  impact  on B3 and B2 respec-   tively. Similarly,  B4, B7 and B8 have the highest  R + C score, respec-   tively, suggesting  these as the most inﬂuential  barriers  to sustain-   able food waste management  from the consumers’  perspective.   5. Discussions   Barriers  that have the highest  net causal-effect   values,  therefore,  have the greatest  long-term  impact  on the system,  so  long-term  effort s should be made to address  these issues. Similarly,   the barriers  with the highest  prominence  values have the poten-  tial to affect and/or be affected  by other barriers.  Therefore,  man-  agers and policymakers  should prioritize  addressing  or circumvent-   ing these in the short-term,  presenting  a practical  approach  to  the otherwise  complex  web of political,  technological,  and insti-  tutional  structures  . The interdepen-   dencies  and interrelationships  highlight  the previously  noted im-  portance  of integrated  decision  making  in CE activities  and design  .  Table 10 summarizes  the overall results and provides  a com-  parison  of key cause and high prominence  barriers.  The results  reveal many similarities  in the responses  of the three evaluator   groups.  For example,  weak legal enforcement   is identiﬁed  as  a key cause barrier  by all three evaluator  groups.  This ﬁnding  is  in line with that of Farooque  et al.   which focused  on bar-  riers to circular  food supply chains in China. All three evaluator   groups  also identify  the lack of environmental  education  and ac-  countability   as a cause barrier,  which conﬁrms  the ﬁnding   of Zhang et al.  on the barriers  to smart waste manage-   ment in China. The strength  of legal enforcement  is a societal  ele-  ment that will affect all evaluator  groups.  These results enable us  to assess barriers  beyond  those that may be identiﬁed  with insti-  tutional  perspectives  . While there  may be separate  legal requirements  that affect a given industry   or evaluator  group more than another,  there is a consensus  that  the weak enforcement  of the legal framework  in this area reduces   the need for action;  this result is different  to the identiﬁcation   of Yuan  of an inadequate  regulatory  environment.  Simi-  larly, the low levels of environmental  education  would inﬂuence   individuals  acting within each of the evaluator  groups;  long-term   changes  to a national  curriculum  would lead to positive  changes   within each evaluator  group . Greater  education   will enable ﬁrms to enhance  their awareness   ), collect better data ,  and develop  improved  performance  monitoring  systems  (Su et al.,  2013).  In the same way, there is a consensus  among  the study evalu-  ators on the role of barrier  B8 . Food  processors  consider  it as key cause barrier,  whereas  sales and dis-  tribution  channels  and consumers  view it as the most prominent   barrier.  The relatively  small scale that many food processors  oper-  ate on will mean that their lack of economies  of scale will lead  to and contribute  more to other barriers;  in contrast,  the scale of  many sales and distributions  ﬁrms will mean that this is less likely  to be a cause, however,  given its high prominence  score, it will be  one the short term challenges  for the sales and distribution  chan-  nels to address.   Moreover,  both the food processors  and sales and distribution   channels  identiﬁed  B2   as the prominent   barrier.  This is reasonable  as these ﬁrms would rely on the provi-  sion of suﬃcient  infrastructure  to support  their effort s in sustain-   able food loss and waste management.  The inﬂuence  of infrastruc-   ture aligns with previous  discussions  on the need for more ﬁrms  along the supply chain and higher  numbers  of ﬁrms involved  . Lastly, B4 (lack of  investment  in advanced  equipment/technologies)  is identiﬁed  with  high prominence  by food processors  and consumers.  The barrier   has similarities  to the ﬁnancing  options  in general  CE studies  in  China ; however,  it is not considered  as a barrier   by sales and distribution  channel  members.  The reason they do  not perceive  it as a barrier  is likely due to the size of the ﬁrms;  many food producers  will be smaller  ﬁrms and they, along with  consumers,  will be less endowed  with ﬁnancial  resources  required   to make or invest in suﬃcient  changes  to improve  food loss and  waste management  processes.  The sales and distribution  ﬁrms tend  to be larger and will tend to have suﬃcient  slack resources  that  can be redeployed  to support  sustainable  food loss and waste man-  agement  activities.   Despite  these similarities,  there are some differences  as well.  For example,  the cost barrier   was identiﬁed  as the key cause  barrier  by sales and distribution  channels.  This identiﬁcation  may  relate to the relatively  small margins  and level of intensity  in many  retail and distribution  environments;  such tight margins  would  preclude  investments  with indeﬁnite  payoffs.  This suggests  oppor-  tunities  for the design and implementation  of improved  incen-  tivization  schemes  . Lack of expertise   was  identiﬁed  by food processors  as the most prominent  barrier  in  their case. The lack of capability  and expertise  in the staff will  be  related  to the low levels of general  capabilities  in society  (partly  driven by low levels of education  in this area) and the sudden  need  for the ﬁrm to gain this expertise.  A general  need for expertise   1123  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   means such expertise  will be hard to acquire,  and it will be chal-  lenging  to overcome  the skill shortage.  Without  the right skills, it  will be diﬃcult  to use new technologies,  and this may relate to the  previously  identiﬁed  issue of a lack of high-end  CE technologies.   The study results also reveal that the key cause and prominent   barriers  are different  from barriers  rankings  based on the evalua-   tors’ importance  rankings  across the three evaluators  (see Tables 5 ,  7 and 9 ). These differences  demonstrate  the importance  of how  techniques  such as Fuzzy DEMATEL  allows us to perceive  the hid-  den interrelationships  between  the evaluators’  responses  that they  are unable to perceive  themselves.   5.1. Theoretical  contributions   The study design was based on both stakeholder  theory and  TRA. The results provide  evidence  that there are different  barri-  ers as perceived  by each of the stakeholders.  It also provides  ﬁrms  with a mechanism  to identify  which barriers  are important  to  other stakeholders;  as the barriers  are addressed/resolved,  a spe-  ciﬁc and tailored  communication  plan can be developed  to com-  municate  this to the other two distinct  stakeholder  groups  that  were included  in the study, addressing  the areas of greatest  im-  portance  to the other stakeholders  and increasing  inclusivity  in  the management  of supply chain processes  ( Boons and Lüdeke-   Freund,  2013 ).  The analysis  of relationships  between  barriers  provides  new in-  sight into TRA in the applications  within CE. The results provide  an  analysis  of the interactions  between  the barriers  and these are im-  plicitly  addressing  both inter- and intra-organizational  subjective   norms . As a result, future work that  seeks to develop  mechanisms  to inﬂuence  behaviour  under pres-  sure from external  stakeholders,  can use these results to analyse   the potential  for the co-creation  of sustainability  processes  and  food loss and waste management  . Future  research  might extend the TRA analysis  by providing  perspectives   from government  policy makers,  as a key inﬂuencer  of subjec-   tive norms in the country.  Understanding  the relationship  between   barriers  also enhances  decision-making  for managers,  as they can  isolate and address  barriers  in a systematic  approach,  addressing   challenges  to the transition  to a CE business  model that is prof-  itable . Governing  bodies and Boards  of Directors  may also implement  measurement  models  and metrics   that force greater  managerial  consideration  of the CE requirements   .  5.2. Implications  for Practice  and Policy  The results and ﬁndings  presented  above provide  insights  from  three different  types of representative  stakeholders:  food proces-   sors, sales and distribution  channels,  and consumers.  The identiﬁed   barriers  and their interdependencies  indicate  a strong role for both  managerial  decision-makers  as well as government  policy makers   to work in unison to develop  frameworks,  metrics,  and industrial   structures  to systematically  address  the barriers.  From the results  presented  in section  4 , we develop  the following  implications  for  policy and practice.   First, weak legal enforcement  is one of the fundamental  reasons   behind  the largely absent/ineffective  food loss and waste manage-   ment mechanism  in China. This weak enforcement  remains  dis-  tinct from the presence  of regulations  ( Yuan, 2017 ; Farooque  et al.,  2019b ) but may be related  to the complexities  of localized  admin-   istration  and coordination  . The complexities  of the  agri-food  systems  also make it diﬃcult  to enforce  legalisation  as  CE implementation  requires  infrastructure  support  along the whole  supply chain, from farmers  to food processors,  wholesalers,  retail-  ers, logistics  service  providers,  consumers,  and waste management  organizations.  However,  speciﬁc  examples  exist of enhanced  en-  forcement.  For instance,  in Shanghai  City, from 01 July 2019, they  have begun to enforce  the new “Regulations  on the Management  of  Household  Waste” . This includes  both require-   ments for individuals  and organizations  to comply,  with ﬁnes of  50-200  RMB for individuals  and up to 50,0 0 0 RMB for organiza-   tions. The ﬁrst tranche  consisting  of 623 ﬁnes were applied  af-  ter inspecting  1588 communities,  406 enterprises  and institutions,   1853 ﬁrms and other groups.  At this time, the ﬁrst batch of social  supervisors  for domestic  waste management  were employed.  Other  legal requirements  include  the Environmental  Protection  Law, re-  cently enhanced  to make punishments  stricter.  However,  they fo-  cus on the most polluting  industries  rather than food loss or waste.  While the Circular  Economy  Promotion  Law was amended  in 2018,  there are no provisions  speciﬁc  on food loss or waste. The Anti-  food Waste Law  focuses  on food security  and has un-  clear measurements  and weak punishments,  generating  what will  likely be weak enforcement.  From these measures,  speciﬁc  initia-  tives should include  ﬁnes suﬃciently  high to deter undesired  ac-  tions, food waste and loss should be acknowledged  as a key driver  in the environmental  protection  and CE promotion  laws, and the  measurements  and requirements  for compliance  should be clear  and simple for citizens  to understand.   Second,  the lack of environmental  education  and accountabil-   ity is a major contributor  to the lack of food waste management   culture  throughout  the food systems/food  supply chains.  The is-  sue is complicated  by the need to involve  multiple  stakeholders   in the industry  . As it often takes  years and even generations  to change  a culture,  the journey  to  a CE in China is likely to be a marathon  for achieving  SCP. In-  dustry groups  will need to include  multiple  stakeholders  and de-  velop joint systems  and metrics  that can be agreed on and applied   widely to improve  accountability.  Oﬃcials  can also be employed  in  roles that directly  hold organizations  accountable  such as in Shang-   hai in 2019 .  Third, the Lack of economies  of scale in collecting  and pro-  cessing  food wastes for value recovery  is a primary  concern  of  food supply chain stakeholders,  and this inhibits  investments  in  food waste management.  Greater  inclusion  of ﬁrms over the sup-  ply chain  and moving  beyond   the effort s of an individual  ﬁrm  will be neces-  sary. In cities like Shanghai  and Beijing where there is infrastruc-   ture for household  waste sorting,  consumers  need to separate  food  wastes at source to allow them to be collected  and consolidated  for  value recovery.  The barrier  in the economies  of scale is likely to be  overcome  when there is increased  participation  by ﬁrms and con-  sumers  in sustainable  food waste management.  Measures,  such as  the use of Industry  4.0 technologies,  may help smaller  ﬁrms to col-  laborate  in a way that they can overcome  some of the scale-based   challenges  .  Given the results,  further  attention  by food processors  and dis-  tribution  ﬁrms in the supply chain must be placed on developing   solutions  to the source separation  challenge.  Through  careful  re-  design of collection  processes,  the waste management  processes   for ﬁrms can recover  value from food wastes.  When this waste is  separated  from the waste that is directed  to landﬁll,  ﬁrms will be  able to support  their transition  to a circular  supply chain in the  food industry  while maintaining  proﬁtability  ( Loon and Wassen-   hove, 2020 ).  Consumer  separation  of waste is also necessary,  and as much of  household  waste is food waste, there is increasingly  the need for  ﬁrms to invest in source separation  but also the subsequent  waste  treatment  facilities  and associated  capabilities.  Such infrastructure   may use food wastes to create organic  fertilizers,  generate  biogases,   and feedstock.  New technology  platforms  and Industry  4.0 may en-  able this collaboration  within the sector . These  1124  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   initiatives  may require  wider collaboration  outside  of traditional   collaboration  within the sector and may require  developing  cross-  sectoral  initiatives  to tackle waste management  challenges.  Lessons   from pilots in China and elsewhere  suggest  that technologies  can  improve  separation  of waste effort s , improve   consumer  understanding  and behaviors  , and mon-  etary subsidies  can inﬂuence  behaviors  .  Firms should work to enhance  their capability  and expertise  in  CE  and food waste  management.  Large ﬁrms may implement  training  programmes.   The prominence  of this barrier  also suggests  a role for third-party   training  organizations  to provide  certiﬁcation  and training  both for  existing  staff  and  for  job seekers  who will be able to apply their developed  expertise  to  beneﬁt  employers.   These results have clear implications  for policymakers  in addi-  tion to managers.  First, there is a role for the Chinese  government   to take a more active role in their involvement  in food waste CE  and add additional  regulatory  pressures  on participants.  All evalua-   tors have identiﬁed  the need for regulatory  change  as a crucial bar-  rier that policymakers  are best positioned  to overcome.  The funda-  mental  problem  here is not the lack of CE legislation  in China, but  its lack of enforcement  caused  by a variety  of reasons.  The legis-  lation process  in China is top-down  and usually  involves  very lim-  ited public participation  or consultation.  Consequently,  many laws  are not widely known  or supported  by the public. Furthermore,  a  piece of legislation  may be passed when the required  physical  and  institutional  infrastructure  is still not in place, making  it practically   infeasible  to be enforced.  Overall,  the legal system  in China is still  underdeveloped  and the court system  is not independent  from the  government  administration  as in the Western  countries.  Therefore,   a well-intended  CE legislation  is not necessarily  in the priority  list  of local government  oﬃcials  when there are more urgent matters   competing  for their attention.   Second,  the government  should offer ﬁnancial  supports  to sus-  tainable  food loss and waste management  activities.  In compar-   ison with many developed  countries,  the population  density  in  most Chinese  cities is much higher which creates  an advantage   for achieving  the economies  of scale in food waste collection  and  processing.  Nevertheless,  the economic  value that can be recovered   from most food wastes is low, so there is a lack of economic  incen-  tive among  food waste management  organizations.  To overcome   this issue, the government  may consider  offering  and increasing   subsidies  to the involved  organizations.  Experiences  in Ghana sug-  gest that direct incentives  to households  can improve  participate   in waste source separation  initiatives  . The  government  may also consider  increasing  investments  in the es-  sential infrastructure  required  for source separation  of food waste,  food waste collection,  and value recovery  operations  such as com-  posting,  anaerobic  digestion,  and waste-to-energy  conversion.  Such  green investments  are justiﬁable  as sustainable  food loss and waste  management  has substantial  environmental  beneﬁts  in reducing   greenhouse  gas emissions  which helps combat  climate  change.  It  also helps restore  soil fertility  which enables  more sustainable   farming.   An additional  policy role is the improvement  of educational  in-  vestments  in improving  food loss and waste management.  There is  a clear need for both business  professionals  and consumers  to have  greater  insight  into the importance  and mechanisms  for sustain-   able food loss and waste management,  and changing  the nature of  national  educational  systems  and national  curricula  would address   this concern.  Speciﬁc  education  initiatives  could include  advertis-   ing and promotional  material.  Initiatives  could also consider  the  use of social supervisors  for domestic  waste management,  which  was introduced  in Shanghai  in 2019 . While  China ﬁrst implemented  environmental  education  in 1973, to en- hance awareness,  in 2003, two curriculums  were updated  in pri-  mary and secondary  schools.  In 2011 and 2016, two national  action  guidelines  for environmental  communication  and education  (2011-  2015; 2016-2020)  were promulgated.  The current  environmental   education  system  focuses  on professional  education  and less em-  phasis is placed on the general  citizenship  .  Whereas,  the outcomes  of the education  are not clear, there are  challenges  in how to change  attitudes  and behaviors.  For instance,   there is no detailed  accountability  system  and so there seems to be  little incentive  for behavior  change  relating  to food loss and waste.  A ﬁnal element  that policymakers  may consider  is the impor-  tance of separating  waste streams.  Wang et al.  reported   multiple  successful  cases of using internet  of things  tech-  nologies  to enable accountability  in household  waste source sep-  aration  in China. The implementation  pilots proved  the feasibility   of inducing  a behavioral  change  by providing  incentives  to split  and separate  waste streams  clearly.  They also showed  the prac-  ticality  of using IoT technologies  to achieve  accountability,  which  directly  overcame  one of the key cause barriers  to promote  ef-  fective waste management.  Similarly,  the techniques  outlined  by  Li et al.  can help households  to understand  the composi-   tion of waste and begin to inﬂuence  their behaviors  towards  waste  source separation.  A primary  outcome  of these changes  would be  to enhance  the economies  of scale of waste management.  Im-  proved  economies  of scale should overcome  the hesitation  and re-  luctance  of business  managers  to make necessary  investments  to  enhance  their waste management  processes.   6. Conclusions   The level of food loss and waste globally  appears  to spark con-  cern, but the problem  is driven by different  stakeholder  groups,   each with different  perspectives  and concerns.  The existing  studies   mainly  investigated  food waste management  in the consumption   stage. Despite  food processing  and sales/distribution  stages have  substantial  environmental  impacts,  no study has systematically  in-  vestigated  sustainability  barriers  in these stages along with those  in the consumption  stage. This study narrows  this knowledge  gap  in the research  context  of China, the world’s  largest developing   country  which has an ambition  toward  a transition  to a CE.  This study makes several  key contributions.  First, we use ex-  pert panel data drawn from three supply chain stakeholder  groups     and  we believe  that this research  is the ﬁrst to address  the barriers  to  food loss and waste management  for CE. The study has a signiﬁ-   cant contribution  in identifying  major barriers,  from the perspec-   tives of three supply chain stakeholder  groups  and highlighting  the  causal relationships  between  these barriers.   Second,  the study results make signiﬁcant  contributions  to  practice  and the transition  towards  CE. The results provide  a path-  way for a structured  approach  to addressing  the barriers  along the  supply chain to improve  sustainable  food consumption  and pro-  duction  in China. The causal nature and relationships  suggest  se-  quences  of changes  that can be made to maximise  outcomes,  by  addressing  the key cause barriers  with the ﬁrst initiatives.  We  identify  ‘weak legal enforcement’  and ‘lack of environmental  ed-  ucation  and accountability’  as key cause barriers  that are con-  sistently  identiﬁed  along the food supply chain by all the food  processors,  sales and distribution  channels,  and consumers.  Such  a cause barrier  suggests  that a transition  would be enhanced  by  careful  policy making  to enhance  the food production  sector, with  stricter  measurement,  enforcement  of regulations,  and provision  of  household  subsidies.  Technologies  can be used to improve  com-  pliance  and enhance  education  and household  understanding  of  waste separation.  Applications  of subsidies  and direct monetary  in-  centives  can also inﬂuence  household  behaviors.  Also, food pro-  1125  Y. Liu, L.C. Wood, V.G. Venkatesh  et al. Sustainable  Production  and Consumption  28  1114–1129   cessors  perceive  the lack of economies  of scale as a critical  cause  barrier  and the inadequate  infrastructure,  lack of investment  in ad-  vanced  equipment/technologies,  and lack of expertise  as prominent   barriers.  Sales and distribution  ﬁrms perceive  the cost barriers  as a  key cause barrier  and the infrastructure  and lack of economies  of  scale as prominent  barriers.  The consumers  see the lack of invest-   ment in advanced  equipment/technologies,  cost barriers,  and the  economies  of scale as prominent  barriers.  Together,  these ﬁndings   should support  government  and business  decision-making  in sup-  porting  a transition  to a more sustainable,  circular  economy,  and  targeting  the development  of new policies  and investments  in ap-  propriate  infrastructure  to reduce food loss and waste.  Last but not the least, this study makes strong theoretical   contributions.  This study employed  dual theoretical  lenses of the  stakeholder  theory and TRA at the ﬁrm level to explore  the bar-  riers to sustainable  food consumption  and production.  The study  ﬁndings  aﬃrm the explanatory  power of these two theories;  there-  fore, provide  guidance  to further  studies  on sustainable  consump-   tion and production.   Future research  should conduct  similar  studies  in other coun-  tries, to enable us to understand  the role of culture  in inﬂuenc-   ing these barriers.  Some barriers  (e.g., legal enforcement  and ed-  ucation)  will be driven by the speciﬁcs  of the countries  studied.   A cross-national  study may support  the identiﬁcation  of barriers   that will be more generalizable  to other settings.  Future research   will also need to be conducted  on how to overcome  these barri-  ers; while these results present  a causal connection  between  the  barriers  additional  exploratory  research  may uncover  solutions  to  managing  the barriers  grounded  in leading  industrial  practices  and  through  the development  and implementation  of effective  metrics.  Sector-speciﬁc  studies  that may be qualitative  or based on action  research  may enable mechanisms  to be determined  that support   ﬁrms in overcoming  barriers  such as the key cause barriers  of cost,  economies  of scale, and improving  internal  accountability.
