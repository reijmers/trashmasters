Brazilian postconsumer plastic packaging waste PPW ows using materialow analysis MFA for the year The system modeled covered from the manufacturing stage of plastic packaging up to its waste management stage We used a range of data sources whose quality we assessed using uncertainty characterization The results showed that Brazil generated Mt ofPPW in and the management of of that was not monitored The majority of monitored PPW was disposed of into landlls but Mt of PPW was improperly disposed Informal collection was greater than formally managed selective collection Only of the PPW generated in Brazil wasrecycled The results identied the major national challenges in relation to PPW management as being that information systems needed to be improved informal waste collectors needed to be socially and productively included in the management systems and recovery systems needed to be developedtowards a circular economy C Published by Elsevier Ltd Introduction Largescale production and use of plastic have increased expo nentially since the s Geyer et al Geyer et al estimated that Mt of plastics were produced worldwide from to The packaging industry is the sector that consumes most plastic polymers in of plastic polymers worldwide were used for packaging production Groh et al As a result plastic waste generation has grown worldwide In the plastic share in municipal solid waste MSW in high and middleincome countries was less than and it rose to over by Jambeck et al Plastic waste is of particular concern as the scientic commu nity has reported several adverse effects on human health and on the environment caused by plastics Moreover plastic pollution in marine and freshwater environments has emerged as a global issue EerkesMedrano et al Hence proper managementof plastic waste could contribute to reducing its environmental impacts Eygen et al In highincome countries plastic recycling has increased due to legislative and economic instruments UNEP Indeed in the European Union adopted an action plan for a circular economy in which prioritize strategies for managing plastic pack aging European Commission However until only of all plastics ever made worldwide were recycled Geyer et al In developing countries in particular recycling rates are far below their potential In Brazil according to the National Sanita tion Information System SNIS in

to promote the packaging reverse logistic as an instrument of the PNRS Furthermore informal waste collectors called waste pickers are responsible for most of the recycling in lowincome countries achieving recycling rates of to for MSW UNEP Therefore MSW management in Brazil is a complex task because in addition to economic and environmental aspects there is also the socioeconomic aspect represented by the waste pickers work within the collection classication and commercialization of recyclable waste Fidelis et al such as postconsumer packaging plastic waste PPW Federal Government and some State Governments during the rst decade of this century pro moted the socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers by enforcing legislation and nancing socioeconomic inclusive programs for waste pickers Even tough society tends to neglect these professionals Material ow analysis MFA is a relevant tool for plastic waste management analysis since it provides a systematic assessment of the state of and changes in material ows within a system dened in space and time Brunner and Rechberger Allesch et al reviewed the application of MFA in waste management and their results showed that MFA is instru mental in understanding how waste management systems work Thus several studies on MFAs for solid waste and for plastics products have been conducted for developed countries Bogucka et al Brouwer et al Deshpande et al Eygen et al Eygen et al Kawecki et al Despite its relevance MFA has not been widely applied in low and middleincome countries Applying MFA in developing countries can be challenging due to limited data Millette et al However Vilaysouk et al measured material inputs and outows of waste and emissions for Laos Kabera et al realized a massow diagram of MSW for Kigali in Rwanda and Makarichi et al performed an MFA on solid waste for Zimbabwe Millette et al conducted an MFA of plastics for Trinidad and Tobago Performing MFAs using currently available data could also support the development of a circular economy within a developing country Millette et al In Brazil a key consideration for managers and researchers when analyzing MSW systems is data availability because infor mation is lacking IbezForz et al Even so plastic waste management has been studied already for Brazil Pacheco et al measured the plastic recycling capacity of Rio de Janeiro Rutkowski and Rutkowski analyzed Brazilian recycling chains for plastics by visiting waste pickers associations Coelho et al analyzed logistics models for postconsumer PET recy cling for Brazil Oliveira et al investigated the supply chain and reverse channels of polystyrene EPS packaging in Brazil and pointed to the main challenges facing a move towards a circular economy However MFA has not yet been used for analyzing PPW ows in Brazil Therefore the question that the present study aims to answer is What was the PPW management ow system like in Brazil in and what barriers and opportunities are there to improving it Further to that we ask What role did the informal waste sec tor play The study aims to analyze the challenges the country would face in reaching a more circular production of PPW consid ering the socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers This study is the rst MFA for PPW in Brazil and provides an estimate of previ ously unknown ows the informal collection of PPW the PPW tailing in sorting units and the nonmonitored management of PPW Method A static MFA of PPW was realized for Brazil in to analyze the PPW management in the country We identied and syn thetized disperse data on PPW management in Brazil Firstly we collected information from existing databases then we compiled the information to represent the input values of the ows The MFA was performed by balancing the system and calculating the ows output values System description The MFA studied PPW which is MSW industrial waste was not considered and PPW polymeric composition was not analyzed Plastic product chains comprise three main stages the pro duction consumption and waste management Eygen et al The qualitative model of PPW management in Brazil is pre sented in Support Information S In the production stage plastic packaging is manufactured the MFA system does not consider the primary production of plastics Further on plastic packaging is sold by the manufacturing industry for consumption In addition Brazilian imports and exports of plas tic packaging are regarded as plastic packaging delivered for consumption After plastic packaging is used it is discharged as MSW and referred to as PPW In Brazil MSW covers urban cleaning waste household waste and commercial solid waste similar to household waste in nature composition and volume PNRS In Brazil irregular disposal of MSW is a main concern IPEA Thus we counted a PPW ow that its management is not monitored so the ow represents the material that is managed but not mon itored and the mismanaged material that could have leaked out of the system The Brazilian PPW collection system was observed in terms of three main categories mixed collection selective collection and informal collection Mixed collection is unsorted MSW sent for disposal Cunha and Caixeta Filho as general waste in landlls controlled dump sites or dumpsites SNIS a While landll is technically designed and monitored dumpsites are not The controlled dump sites receive a layer of soil Guimares et al The mixed col lection of PPW is undertaken by public agencies private agencies and other agents such as philanthropic entities and large solid waste generators SNIS a Selective collection is only of dry recyclable waste Selective col lection in Brazil is undertaken by public agencies private agenciesand waste pickers associations or cooperatives with formal agree ment or contract with municipalities SNIS a Informal collection is the nonregulated activity of extraction of recyclable materials such as PPW from mixed MSW Ezeah et al or segregated material that is given directly to waste pickers without municipalities control The informal sector recycling net work is composed of household waste collectors street pickers itinerant waste buyers MSW collection crews dumpsite pickers intermediate dealers Ezeah et al and waste pickers associ ation or cooperatives Collected PPW is transported to sorting units for sorting press ing baling and trading of recyclable waste to recycling centers Campos SNIS a A variable percentage of PPW is untted for recycling and discharged as tailing Some PPW is recy cled for the manufacture of new packaging and some is recycled for nonpackaging applications Brouwer et al Incineration was not examined because this technology is not used for MSW treatment in Brazil Lima et al SNIS a I Pimentel Pincelli A Borges de Castilhos Jnior M Seleme Matias et al Waste Management Data collection and compilation We collected data on PPW management in Brazil from existing data sources mostly ofcial Brazilian government databases A description of the data sources is presented in Table S and a summary of all data utilized for each input ow is provided in Table S Support Information S however we did not have pre viously information about the informal collection of PPW the PPW tailing sorting units and the nonmonitored management of PPW Table S As specic data on PPW are scarce in Brazil we com bined information for estimating MFA input ows Support Infor mation S summarizes the data sources and data compilation for all the input ows The data on plastic packaging mass production and industrial sales in were taken from the annual industrial survey of theBrazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics IBGE IBGE ab The masses compositions of plastic packaging manufac turing and industrial sales are presented in Fig More informa tion about plastic packaging categories manufactured and sold industrially is presented in Support information S Data on importing and exporting plastic packaging were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Economy Industry Foreign Trade and Services MDIC database Calculation procedures were needed for estimating the follow ing input ows the generation of PPW the selective collection of PPW and the mixed collection of PPW The estimation of the generation of PPW was based on Geyer et al procedure by combining plastic packaging production data with plastic packaging lifetime Additionally the amount of plastic packaging imported and exported was considered The life time of plastic packaging is estimated as year Ciacci et al Kuczenski and Geyer Patel et al and its mean lifetime is year Geyer et al Thus we estimated that half of the plastic packaging that became waste in was manufactured in and half in That formula is shown in in which PPW denotes the mass t of plastic packaging waste generated P denotes the mass t of plastic packaging produced and Iand E the mass t of plastic packaging imported and exported The results of the input ow of PPW generation are presented in Sup port Information S PPW PPIICE CE To establish the amount of PPW collected by selective and mixed collection we rstly estimated the MSW collected by selec tive and mixed collection followed by the proportion of plastic packaging in the MSW For MSW collection information data were taken from the SNIS b The SNIS research is the only national research on solid waste with available dataset for the year However munici palities participation in the survey is voluntary and not all of them participated SNIS a Therefore information on MSW man agement for the unreported municipalities was estimated Brazilian databases present the total amount of MSW collected in Brazil which includes that from selective collection Therefore data about MSW collected by mixed collection were extracted from the SNIS b database by deducting the amount collected selectively by each agent for each municipality In this way dataon mixed MSW collected masses were compiled for of the Brazilian municipalities A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to project the MSW collected by mixed collection for the unreported municipalities The general expression of multiple regression is shown in Formula below in which ydenotes the predicted variable adenotes a constant bdenotes the regression coefcients and Cdenotes the independent variables Municipal urban population IBGE ab and municipal GDP were used as independent variables IBGE yabxbxbnxn The SNIS dataset b was used to extract information on the amount of MSW collected by each of the mixed collection agents We collected information on the amount of MSW deposited in landll dumpsites and controlled dumpsites from the SNIS report SNIS a Information about municipalities running selective collection services was extracted from SNIS b and IBGE A total of of the Brazilian municipalities informed SNIS whether they run selective collection services The information for the others was collected from IBGE although related to it allowed a Brazilian overview A total of municipali ties were provided in with ofcial selective collection repre senting of Brazilian municipalities and of population TheSNIS b provided data on the selective collection mass of MSW for of the Brazilian municipalities identied with selective collection services A multiple linear regression analysis was used to project the selectively collected MSW masses for the Fig Plastic packaging produced and sold by industries in Brazil in IBGE ab I Pimentel Pincelli A Borges de Castilhos Jnior M Seleme Matias et al Waste Management unreported municipalities on the SNIS database Municipal gross domestic product GDP IBGE and the human development index HDI UNDP were used as independent variables for projecting selective collection masses The SNIS a report presented a proportional rate of MSW selectively collected by public agencies private agencies and for mal waste picker organizations Thus we determined transfer coef cients for each agency who undertook the selective collection by extracting their respective rate information from the SNIS a report After calculating the masses of MSW collections we estimated the proportion of plastic packaging in the MSW For the proportion of plastic from selective collection the SNIS a information was taken from as published in its report For the proportion of plastic from mixed collection information was taken from IPEA study which is the only national research on Brazilian MSW composition The proportion of plastic waste that is packaging in selective and mixed collections was expressed by Geyer et als worldwide estimate because there are no Brazilian studies about the levels of PPW in MSW Finally the mass of PPW which was recycled was obtained from the Technical Report of the Brazilian Sectoral Agreement for the implementation of reverse logistics of general packaging SINIR Data on manufacturing new products by recycling PPW was extracted from the Brazilian PET Industry Association ABIPET report which referred to PET products The report presents the breakdown of nal uses of recycled PET in Brazil in The rates of PPW recycled for new plastic packaging and for non packaging applications were extracted from this report and used as a transfer coefcient in the MFA system Data quality Data availability to quantify material ows is often limited owing to data scarcity or missing data Laner et al Data used for MFA are interdisciplinary have heterogeneous sources and may vary on formats and qualities Schwab et al There fore assessing the reliability of the ows provides the quantica tion of the data limitations for system understanding The quality of the data sources was assessed using the uncer tainty characterization method developed by Laner et al The approach was developed to include data quality indicators within the pedigree matrix presented by Weidema and Wesn s combined with the quantication of uncertainty based on data source classication as proposed by Hedbrant and Srme Firstly data quality of all MFA input ows was evaluated by data quality indicator scores Sieber et al presented in Support Information S These indicators encompass the geograph ical and temporal representativeness the investigated material and the completeness and reliability of the source Sieber et al The assigned scores for each information source are pre sented in Support Information S These various data quality indicators were translated into uncertainty by coefcients of variation CVs Muchangos et al Uncertainty was assumed to increase exponentially with poor data quality Laner et al Data uncertainty was assumed to be normally distributed because of its mathematical convenience Tran et al These assumptions have also been made by Muchangos et al Eygen et al Tran et al Makarichi et al and Warrings and Fellner while executing Laner et al approach The CVs are the stan dard deviation divided by the mean Eygen et al The detailed procedure for the CV calculation is shown in the Support Information S MFa The input ows that we used to perform the MFA are summa rized in Support Information S We used the previously calculated CVs as input uncertainty values for the input ows Support Infor mation S MFA is based on the law of conservation of matter within the system and all its processes Brunner and Rechberger The ows are calculated by using a material balance to compare the mass of all ows entering leaving and stocked at a process Eygen et al Therefore the mass of all ows entering a pro cess must equal the mass of ows leaving this process plus the stock change Allesch et al Support Information S pre sents the mass balance equations Using this procedure unknown ows can be calculated by balancing the system Eygen et al Therefore the previously unknown ows of the system the informal collection of PPW the PPW tailing in sorting units and the amount of nonmonitored PPW were estimated by the MFA Table S We used STAN software developed by Tu Wien to perform the MFA and for data visualization through a Sankey diagram in which the thickness of the ows was proportional to their value Cencic and Rechberger We used STAN to reconcile data and to perform error propagation STAN is a free software that has been used widely in the scientic literature for several MFAs such as the studies performed by Boh and Clark Tazi et al and Brouwer et al Input redundant information are used to reconcile the MFA input data Cencic and Rechberger The method of least squares is used for data reconciliation in which uncertainties are used as weighing factors Cencic By data reconciliation we calculated the values for the MFA output ows with previous information Subsequentially the reconciled values were used to calculate previously unknown ows Cencic and Rechberger by balancing the system STAN presents a data reconciliation quality DRQ indicator Brouwer et al which expresses the difference between and the mean value of measurement adjustments per maximum allowed adjustment DQR ranges from to Cencic and DQR close to indicates that the reconciled data matched the orig inal data well Brouwer et al Results and discussion Firstly we present the results for the projections of the selec tive and mixed collections of MSW Subsequently we show the input data quality uncertainty of the MFA input ows Finally we display the PPW modeled system and the values of the out puts ows MSW collections projections There were municipalities served by a selective collec tion service in Brazil accounting for of all Brazilian munici palities The SNIS b database lacked information on selective collection mass for of these municipalities which had their mass estimated by linear regression The multiple linear regression equation established to predict the mass of selectively collected MSW in Brazil in is shown in Formula i n which SCM is the selective collection mass t This regression model explains of the original variability Table S The regression residuals follow the normal distribution Figure S and Figure S SCMClogGPDClogCHDII Pimentel Pincelli A Borges de Castilhos Jnior M Seleme Matias et al Waste Management By projecting the selective collection mass for the unreported municipalities in the SNIS b database the mass of selectively collected MSW in Brazil in was estimated as Mt Table The analysis of the SNIS b dataset revealed the MSW mass collected by mixed collection in for municipali ties The mass for the remaining was projected by linear regression The linear regression equation established to predict the mixed MSW collection mass is shown in Formula in which MCM is the mixed collection mass t The modeled regression explains of the original variation Table S and its residuals approximate to the normal distribution Figure S and Figure S MCM ClogUPlogGPD The mixed collection of MSW was projected for the unreported municipalities in the SNIS b database Hence the mixed col lection of MSW in Brazil in was estimated as Mt Table Input CVs We present the assessment of the data quality uncertainties for the input ows in Fig which shows the CV results corresponding to the input ow As a general trend data uncertainties were lower for the plastic packaging production and consumption stages F F F and F and they increased for the solid waste management stage This trend was expected as usually databases used for MFA are more inefcient when moving downstream in the system Schwab et al Detailed information on the input ows quantities and their CVs are provided in Support Information S Overall quality of information on PPW management was quite poor Hence Brazil needs to improve the information systems and information should be rigorously controlled by regulatorycertications Complementary to improving information systems scientic eld investigations could be a valuable tool for checking the data in the eld and improving information quality On the other hand carrying out eld investigation could be challenging because Brazil has continental dimensions PPW ow analysis Balancing the system and reconciling the data resulted in the MFA modeled Fig The results present an overview of Brazilian PPW waste management identifying its general patterns The system of equations was overdetermined and data were reconciled The mixed collection of PPW ow and the nal disposal ows had their data reconciled Support Information S The smaller the deviation of an output ow value after data reconcili ation from the input value the better the consistency of the input data given the balance constraints of the model Klingmair et al The STAN indicator of DQR was which indicated that the reconciled data matched the input data well so the system modeled is consistentThe main outcome of this study was the proposed model for the PPW ows for Brazil in Information not available in the country such as the amount of PPW informally collected wereestimated Most of the PPW generated was not monitored The PPW recycling rate in the country was far below its potential and informal collection was superior to the formal selective collection Plastic packaging manufacture sale and consumption Plastic packaging products consumed in were mostly manufactured within the country around was imported A total of Mt of plastic packaging was manufactured and Mt was sold industrially In Mt of plastic packaging was manufactured world wide Geyer et al Our results present that Mt of plastic packaging was manufactured in Brazil thus the country makes around of the global production of plastic packaging Plastic lids and unspecied plastic pieces for packaging consti tute the greatest proportion of plastic packaging mass manufactured in Brazil Fig However the denition of plastic packaging varies worldwide For example in this study plastic trash bags and plastic bags were regarded as plastic packaging as referred to in the Brazilian National Classication of Economic Activities CNAE and Mercosur Common Nomenclature NCM While the EPA did not consider plastic trash bags for United States PPW analysis plastic bags were included in Brouwer et als study and in the European Unions denition of plas tic packaging waste On the other hand the data of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of The Netherlands consid ered plastic bags as a nonpackaging object Brouwer et al Therefore national databases have their own singularities when dening plastic packaging Moreover quantitatively comparing studies on the ows and processes of plastic packaging in other countries and time periods is difcult as scopes regarding materi als and processes may differ across the studies Eygen et al PPW generation Brazilian PPW generation is estimated at Mt And Brazils per capita generation of PPW was kg similar to South Korea Jang et al found that South Korea was the largest per capita PPW generator when compared to the rate in Germany France United Kingdom Japan and Belgium thus Brazil joined South Kor eas position The Brazilian Packaging Sector Agreement reported that in around Mt of plastic waste was generated in Brazil SINIR which differs from the results of the present study which used a different procedure method The Sector Agreement approach was based on the amount of collected solid waste considering the plas tic packaging manufacturing variation rate SINIR In the present study generation was based on the amount of plastic pack aging manufactured imported and exported considering itsTable Amount of

lifetime As Brazilian information systems do not monitor PPW generation distinct approaches could lead to different results for their mass generation This situation was noted in other countries comparing three studies of MFA for plastics in Austria their results for plastic waste generated showed signicant differences which were attributed to the use of different methods and sources for data collection Eygen et al Nonmonitored PPW The management of almost of the generated PPW was not monitored Brazil needs to improve solid waste governance and information systems Part of the nonmonitored PPW could have been mismanaged and leaked to the environment Only to of solid waste generated in developing countries urban centers is collected and the uncollected waste may be dumped or thrown on the streets and into water bodies Ezeah et al The irregular discharge of PPW is a direct source of environ mental pollution According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation McKinsey Company and the World Economic Forum of plastic packaging waste leaks out of the collection system worldwide either it is not collected at all or it is collected but mis managed Globally Mt of macro plastic was lost to the environ ment in and the major source of plastic loss is the mismanaged MSW in lowincome and lowermiddleincome coun tries Ryberg et al mainly in Africa Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East where there is a high level of plas tic consumption as well as a large proportion of inadequately man aged MSW Ryberg et al When PPW is transported to water bodies plastic debris accu mulates in the oceans becoming a borderless issue of ocean plastic pollution is originated in a terrestrial environmentWalker and Xanthos Improving plastic waste management could prevent plastic waste entering the ocean from land Jambeck et al Jambeck et als study estimated that the Brazilian contribution to plastic waste in oceans in was up to Mt The large amount of nonmonitored PPW in Brazil is alarming for unable the environmental pollution evaluation Mixed collection of PPW and disposal Eightyve percent of the PPW was collected by mixed collec tion and disposed of in landlls controlled dumpsites and dump sites Most of the mixed collection was performed by public or private agencies and private agencies collected about more than the public ones Mixed collection of PPW was llarger than selective and informal collection together which presented a prole for the country stillbased on a linear economy Although the PNRS regulated that recy clable solid waste such as PPW should be recycled PNRS most of the collected PPW was disposed of mostly in landlls Eighty percent of the disposal of PPW was in landlls However about Mt of PPW was disposed of in environmentally inappro priate sites dumpsites or controlled dumpsites Thus Brazil still faces the challenge of closing its dumpsites A few dumps have been closed and many of them continue to operate informally Cruvinel et al Closed dumps are rarely recovered most of them are land covered and abandoned Ramos et al Cur rent improper waste management in Brazil causes environmental and human health impacts through surface and groundwater con tamination and air quality deterioration contributing to climate change Lima et al Ramos et al Disposing plastic waste in landll can contaminate soil and groundwater due to plastic leaching therefore landlling PPW might be considered a shortterm solution Shen et al Teuten et al Globally of plastic waste was incinerated and was accumulated in landlls or the natural environment between and Geyer et al In Austria plastic waste ow analysis showed that was incinerated and landlled Eygen et al In South Korea of PPW was landlled incinerated without energy recovery and incinerated with energy recovery Jang et al In Brazil so far incinera tion is not a viable option there are some recent attempts to pro duce refuse derived fuel RDF Selective and informal collections of PPW Informal collection was about greater than formal selective collection Private agencies performed most of the selective collec tion followed by formal waste picker organizations and nally by public agencies Informal collection of PPW was higher than selective collection and demonstrated the relevance of the waste pickers work Other studies around the world also pointed out that the material collec tion rate from informal collection was higher than from formal col lection YldzGeyhan et al Informal waste pickers sanitation and environmental services are often not recognized IPEA Whereas the formal sector is modern industrialized and legally backed by government agen cies the informal sector lies out of state control Ezeah et al In Brazil informal waste pickers are marginalized people who work collecting recyclable waste They work in unhealthy and pre carious conditions Cruvinel et al Informal material recov ery facilities have little or no institutional control they often do not meet legal or technical requirements or have adequate infrastruc ture Campos which contributes to an unhealthy and unsafe work environment Indeed of the selective collection of PPW was performed by formalized waste picker organizations denoting their inclusion on this service PPW recovery In sorting units of the PPW was discharged because it was unsortable or unsorted PPW are unsortable when it does not meet the standard quality of the recycling centers The quality of the materials in sorting units depends on household separation Gutberlet Fidelis et al noted organic waste arriving to sorting units in Brazil The quality of the material also depends on collection compacting trucks damage the material Gutberlet Furthermore sorting processes also have capacity limitation Gutberlet After the sorting process PPW is sent to recycling factories However only Mt of PPW was recycled Thus only about of the generated PPW in Brazil was recycled in whichshowed poor material efciency Recycling of PPW was quite low in Brazil in Compared with the Sectoral Agreement for Packaging estimation of the Brazilian plastic recycling rate SINIR the results of this study are much lower That is because SINIRs estimation was related to the recycling of collected rather than generated solid waste Almost of plastic packaging was recycled in Italy Lombardi et al In Austria of plastic waste was recycled in Eygen et al and in The Netherlands of PPW was recy cled in Brouwer et al South Korea recycled of PPW in The recycling rates in The Netherlands and Austria were much higher than in Brazil Worldwide recycling of plastic materials is quite low according to Geyer et al only of all plastic material ever produced has been recycled and only of that has been recycled more than once Recycling improve the material efciency most recycled PPW was used for nonpackaging applications and was reinserted intoI Pimentel Pincelli A Borges de Castilhos Jnior M Seleme Matias et al Waste Management other production systems A limitation of the present study is the use of data on PET packaging ABIPET to portray the use of recycled PPW of all polymer types Brouwer et al pointed out that in the Netherlands most packaging manufactured from recycled PPW was PET Indeed the quality uncertainty for the ow of packaging made by recycled PPW was high Fig There fore developing resource and solid waste management informa tion systems could lead to more accurate ow analysis Challenges towards a circular economy The analysis of PPW in Brazil revealed the challenges faced by the country to introduce a more circular productive system for the plastic packaging chain attending to the socioproductive inclu sion of waste pickers The circular economy could improve solid waste management by boosting developing economies through the principles of waste valorization and recycling Ferronato et al The implemen tation of a circular economy depends on redesigning the manage ment system involving all reverse and supply chain actors Oliveira et al Moreover Brazilian policies on solid waste meet the principles of a circular economy Guarnieri et al The Brazilian challenges to promote circular economy are of various kinds from improving the quality of the information sys tem to the socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers through an effective selective collection policy preferably in solidarity The PPW information systems need to be improved because most of the PPW generated was not monitored Indeed the PNRS has foreseen the National Solid Waste Management Information System SINISA PNRS The Packaging Sector Agreement forecast partnerships with the SINISA for evaluating packaging reverse logistics in the country SINIR Moreover the Sector Agreement proposed a partnership with the National Association of Waste Pickers ANCAT for generating information on packaging waste managed by waste pickers SINIR Neither of these information systems has yet been implemented in Brazil but they are expected to be installed soon Guarnieri et al Munici palities need to improve their administration especially the smal ler ones and the ones located in the less developed regions of Brazil Marino et al Furthermore some municipalities have struc tural deciencies they do not have email internet access or com puter which complicate the circulation of information on solid waste management Marino et al PPW generation originates from plastic products used on a daily basis Therefore a drastic change in consumption by society could reduce PPW generation which is challenging because con sumerism is highly evident across the world Andrades et al Nevertheless solid waste generation could be reduced by the transition towards a circular economy in which waste man agement and resource management are addressed together and products are designed to prevent waste generation Brazil needs to promote more effective recycling of PPW as the present study showed a great potential for the recycling industry Waste pickers work must be formalized and endorsed to improve the recycling The need to integrate existing informal recycling sys tems into formal solid waste management was indicated in several studies Ezeah et al IbezForz et al YldzGeyhan et al Ferronato et al pointed out that the rst strat egy to introduce a circular economy within developing countries is the formalization of waste pickers Therefore solid waste strate gies should incorporate informal waste pickers into the formal management process Ferronato et al To address waste pickers marginalization Brazilian policies have the inclusion of waste pickers as a priority when regarding solid waste management Fidelis et al Thus Brazilian poli cies were created for reaching sustainably towards a circular economy Guarnieri et al and a solidarity economy Municipalities can contract their services without bidding process as promulgated by PNRS The Brazilian Packaging Sector Agree ment has undertaken actions to formalize waste pickers in work associations or cooperatives to drive implementation of packaging reverse logistics in the country Guarnieri et al SINIR Actually Rutkowski and Rutkowski considered Brazilian waste pickers inclusive recycling practices were among global best practice for informal sector integration Despite advances to address waste pickers marginalization in Brazil the reality has not yet fullled the principle the informal sector is responsible for most PPW collection for recycling There fore inclusive recycling practices still need to be expanded throughout the country Effective investments and public aware ness are needed to improve solid waste management alongsidewaste picker inclusion Conclusion MFA is an approach worldwide used to assist solid waste man agement Applying MFA for PPW management in Brazil for the year was challenging because of limitation of data availability Indeed the information data quality was assessed Almost twothirds of the PPW generated was not monitored Most of the collected PPW was disposed of describing a linear pro duction system Informal collection was superior to selective col lection which shows the relevance of the waste pickers service A relevant strategy for Brazil to move towards a circular economy is based on promoting an effective socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers Thus we can count on a more efcient and effective PPW recycling with a more accurate data collection We may even be able to propose a decrease in the production of some types of plastics Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing nan cial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inuence the work reported in this paper Acknowledgements This
