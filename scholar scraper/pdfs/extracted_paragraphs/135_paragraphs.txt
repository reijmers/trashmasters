The economy that runs on waste: accumulation in the circular city Federico Savini Department of geography, planning and international development studies, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ABSTRACT Conventional wisdom holds that the circular economy will provide a sustainable pathway to economic growth. Advocates of circularity insist that maintainingeconomic growth, while simultaneously reducing both inputs of materials and outputs of waste, entails closing material streams in cities. This article examines the roots and legacy of these prescriptions in environmental policymaking. It argues that the circular economy represents a regime of eco-accumulation in which waste is main resource of production and consumption. Focusing on the legacy of circulareconomy policies in the Netherlands and Amsterdam, the article provides an account of the building of a nationwide green-growth urban agenda underpinned by the valorization of waste. It dissects three social, economic, and institutional processes and factors through which circularity takes shape:  the recon ﬁguration of the multi-level structure through which waste processing has been governed;  the promotion of a city-regional economy of micro-logistics and industrial manufacturing for waste materials; and  the centrality of households in producing and consuming waste in the urban environment. The article concludes by questioning the limits of an economy dependent on waste.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 1 May 2018 Accepted 18 August 2019 KEYWORDS Circular economy; waste;resource; logistics; city-regions But in cities, the same materials will be retrieved over and over again.

Questioning the circular economy Across a variety of socio-economic sectors, policy makers, corporations, and environmental groups are increas- ingly putting forward notions of ‘circular economy’—or just ‘circularity ’. These notions indicate a variegated set of practices for transitioning towards a sustainable socio-economic system. Common examples include thereuse of organic waste such as biomass or biogas; innovative product design to facilitate recycling; integratedheat infrastructure in both industrial and residential building construction; acquathermie in residential areas; repair cafés in urban neighborhoods; or digital sharing platforms . An inspirational and abstract concept, the circular economy is most clearly de ﬁned in opposition to the ‘linear ’ economy, based on a ‘make-use-dispose ’consumption paradigm. Environmental economists stress that a cir- cular economy o ﬀers a pathway to a post-extractivist society, in which the material demands of economic growth are recovered from existing human activities (see, for example, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015 ; © 2019 The Author.

Both visionary and technically achievable, this idea has found much favor in national and local governments all over Europe. Hence, the concept of circularity is now beginning to be applied in the development of policies combining urban development, utilities reorganization, and energy policies in city-regions. Examples includetheBe-Circular Brussels redevelopment plan; Copenhagen Model for circular bio-waste streams; Paris Circular Economy Plan for valorizing waste; the Dutch plan Netherlands Circular 2050 ; among others. Circularity is also driving urban redevelopment projects attempting to integrate waste, heat, and energy networks, such as Tam-pere’sEco3business park, London ’sold Oak and Park royal and Gent’ sOld Dockyard (see Savini & Habdank, 2018, for a complete list). Despite its increasing prominence in city-regional governance, scholarship on the circular economy is pri- marily concerned with either its infrastructural and commercial realizations, or the micro-practices of sharing, living, and waste reuse among households. As Hobson and Lynch write, ‘frameworks for, and analysis of, the CE  have arguably side-stepped detailed considerations of its broader socio-economic impli- cations, being all-but silent on what a CE society might look like ’. More opti- mistic studies have argued that circular economy mobilizes initiatives promoting social reciprocity, ecologicallyresponsible consumerism, product sharing, and eco-manufacturing in city-regions . While underscoring the inadequacy of existing de ﬁnitions of circularity in urban planning, others praise the idea ’s potential for addressing the problems of resource scarcity, waste, and ecosystem services . Critical works de ﬁne circularity as ‘the latest and most sophisticated version of the ‘sustainable ’fetishized com- modity ’. Finally, others dismiss circularity as a ‘bundle of ideas ’that mobilizes a new morality of ecologically-oriented economic consumption and production . Although these works have begun to question the socio-spatial implications of circularity for society and urban areas, they do so only to re-conceptualize the circular economy. We lack, therefore, evidence-based account explaining why and how this notion has been mobilized in environ- mental governance. Toﬁll this gap, this article takes a macro-perspective of the circular economy, shedding light on the concept ’s roots and legacy in national and local sustainable development programs. In so doing, it contends that the cir-cular economy marks the beginning of the capitalist economy ’s structural adaptation to problems of waste accumulation and resource scarcity. It shows how the concept is driving a nationwide strategy to valorize waste as a resource for city-regional growth. Mobilizing the concept of ‘regimes of accumulation ’, the article hones in on three processes: the changing multi-level governance of waste processing; the expanding market for material and waste logistics in city-regions; the centrality of households in producing and consuming urban  material. The article concludes by considering the risks of constructing a paradigm for green economic growth based on waste recovery. The article results from research carried out in the Netherlands in 2017 and 2018, focusing on the Amster- dam city-region . The Dutch context represents an extreme case of circular economy policy application, in which the term is increasingly used across a di ﬀuse constellation of oﬃcial policy papers, agreements, studies, and programmatic governmental papers in di ﬀerent sectors. Further- more, the notion of the circular economy is centrally prominent in the current governmental debate about theclimate act , especially in relation to sustainability programs. Since 2008, both nation-ally and locally elected o ﬃcials, industrial ﬁrms (in logistics, marketing, data processing, food and agriculture, water management, and other areas), banking institutions, and environmental advocacy groups have embracedcircularity, incorporating it in their policies and visions. At the time of writing, all of the political parties in theAmsterdam city council present circularity as a viable approach to sustainable growth . Because Amsterdam is exceptional in the discourse of circularity, the following analysis refrains from makinggeneral claims. Instead, the study ’s purpose is to trace the genealogy of a policy idea and unpack its key social, economic, and institutional processes. In the ﬁrst section, I build on work in urban political ecology to sketch out the changing position of waste in both modern capitalism in general and existing forms of environmental governance in particular. In the second676 F. SAVINI and third section, I unpack three key processes that explain waste ’s shifting role in circular economy policies. I then focus on the roots and legacy of circular economy policymaking in the Netherlands and Amsterdam. In so doing, I show how this idea conveys an accumulation regime that maintains economic growth while transition- ing to non-fossil based energy production; reducing imports of raw materials; and promoting a material logis- tics sector in city-regions. Finally, I argue that these policies depend on a form of urban eco-entrepreneurialism,in which waste is beauti ﬁed and households become waste ‘prosumers. ’ The marginality of waste in modern  accumulation In modern capitalism, waste has become a ‘negativity ’ of production and consumption.1In this context, it is posited as ‘the political other of value ’, the ‘degree zero of value’ , or anti-value in the circulation of capital . ‘From the perspective of economics, ’writes Gille, ‘waste is not merely uninteresting but is rendered explicitly invisible or is explained away in theories and models that somehow marginally relate to the topic of waste ’. As Ghandy argues, the disappearance of waste from any spatial, social, and economic relation was the constitutive ‘illusion ’ of‘hygienist ’approaches to modern environmental planning . Indeed, much planning of modern city-regions betrays this need to displace production and consumption ’s unwanted residues. Cities depended on zoning schemes that separate residential areas from waste treatment plants, such as land ﬁlls and incinerators. The regulation of unwanted residual materials has been increasingly centralized in national governments, thus rising above inter-municipal con ﬂicts over waste disposal. When not incinerated or buried, inert or hazardous waste is either displaced to the very edges of urban agglomerations or globally exported to the planet ’s waste- lands. Urban waste tends to re-emerge within the urban fabric only as ‘stubborn reminders ’of modern waste displacement ’s shortcomings . Indeed, waste has been largely marginal in modern economic production and consumption, especially at city-regional levels of scale. To explain waste ’s changing role in contemporary economic development, I use the concept of ‘regimes of accumulation ’. A term developed by the regulation school for analyzing the reorganization of capitalism in socio-economic crises, a regime of accumulation is a historically and geographically contingent articulation of capitalist production and consumption processes. Regime are institutionalized through modes of regulation comprising multi-layered set of institutions, social norms, values, and laws, which together valorize particular goods, materials, and practices over others . The term ‘regime ’has been particularly e ﬀective in critical studies of how economic growth articulates with principles of ecological development. Speci ﬁcally, it provides a framework in which to analyze how ecological states re-regulate the economy to integrate ecological priorities and economic development . Three dimensions of regimes of accumulation are particularly relevant in studying waste in contemporary circular economic models. First, regimes can be identi ﬁed by the scales —or polity— at which the production, circulation, and realization of value are regulated. Regimes of accumulation unwind through the rescaling ofthe state across geo-political levels, visible in how responsibilities, governance networks and regulatory pre- scriptions shift to di ﬀerent levels of government. Second, regimes manifest in and through particular modalities of commodity production and circulation, and particular distributions of value across social and market sectors. They are de ﬁned by shifting features of commodity markets in economic growth, speci ﬁc combinations of com- modiﬁ ed goods, services, and experiences. Third, regimes are structured around distinctive compositions of productive capacity and social demand. These are evident in the articulation of the state-market system – intended as an apparatus or machinery of governing –and crucially the role of individuals in economic pro- duction and consumption . Even after sustainability became central to national policy agendas, waste was hardly accorded a cen- tral role in production and consumption processes. Until very recently, waste processing has remainedanchored in a management paradigm. Although this paradigm was especially important in setting environ- mental quality standards, it remained marginal in economic governance . Waste accumu- lation was increasingly politicized during the 1980s, when the European green-left waged a ‘war-on-waste ’ . Anti-consumerist activists pointed out waste accumulation ’s negative, environmentallyJOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING 677 harmful consequences. Following this, European regulations against land ﬁlling pushed national governments to modernize waste management, develop state-of-the art waste incinerators, and strengthen waste diversion schemes to improve recycling. Waste became matter of interest for both ﬁrms operating in the waste processing sector  and zero-waste movements ﬁghting against waste facilities as such . In the early 1990s, European environmental agendas made waste an important target of eco-modernization and infrastructural investment. To facilitate the capture of valuable materials and e ﬀective recycling, waste regulation mandated rigorous management hierarchies. National governments progressively ‘regionalized ’ waste processing. Regional authorities  undertook policies that diverted waste from land ﬁll and incineration . Improving waste incineration technologies also allowed city-regional governments to control the environmental andhealth risks of waste-to-energy plans. Waste management begun to follow a ‘self-suﬃ ciency ’paradigm (Buclet & Godard, 2013 ), as regions came to rely on a oligopolistic chain of waste recovery . The regio- nalization and partial liberalization of waste management was unable to recon ﬁgure existing conceptions of waste in economic development: recycled materials remained secondary to raw materials. In addition, hazar- dous materials and heavy metals required complex processing in transnational circuits. In other cases, waste was targeted by illicit economies and trans-national agreements, through which countries including the Nether-lands , Denmark, Norway, and Germany have come to import other countries ’waste for disposal or management . 2 The consolidation of sustainable growth agendas in the mid-2000s marked a change in the way cities dealt with resources, especially energy. However, this hardly changed waste ’s position in  growth regimes. European policies have addressed problems of CO 2reduction; energy e ﬃciency in production; housing and transport; and responsible ecological consumerism . The ecological regime of accumulation of the early 2000 builds upon the ambition of greening economic production, sustaining rises in clean industry;environmental innovation; dependency on renewables; decentered energy markets; energy e ﬃciency in prop- erty development; and energy labeling . This regime was driven by a coalition of actors across real-estate, green political parties, environmental activists, creative industries, hi-tech, and auto-mation. Explicitly, this coalition combined energy e ﬃciency with principles of smart growth (Bossuyt & Savini, 2017; Caprotti, 2014). In this context, citizens were posited as  responsible consumers, eco- eﬃcient homeowners, and environmentally concerned voters. This historical overview has emphasized waste ’s marginality in the early forms of environmental and econ- omic governance. It was secondary to the immaterial economies of ﬁnance, knowledge, and hi-tech. Waste was also kept geographically separate from residential areas, being processed in regional peripheries or transnation-ally. The waste market largely remained a sector of public agencies, with incineration and water companies operating at regional scale . Finally, waste remained alien to domestic life and consumption; households were involved only in separating glass, paper, plastic, and  food for recycling. Waste valorization: raw materials beyond recycling The contemporary popularity of circular economic models in sustainability agendas suggest emergent features of a regime of accumulation in which waste is treated as not an output to manage, but a resource for economicdevelopment. Prototypes of circular production date to the late 70s, when industrial manufacturing groups began investing in industrial symbiosis and e ﬀective industrial design to set up an economically pro ﬁtable material recovery process. Concerned with raw materials and energy supply, these groups organized cradle- to-cradle infrastructural and design systems that transform one company ’s residuals into another ’s input . Models of industrial synergy minimizethe costs of raw materials in existing production processes . Cost e ﬀective symbiosis required proximate industrial plants, while zoning separated waste reuse from residential areas. These approaches precipitated more recent models of circular economy. As such, they mark a redeﬁ nition678 F. SAVINI of waste ’s  value, in which waste became a resource for further production (Lacy & Rutqvist, 2016; Pauli, 1999; Urbinati, Chiaroni, & Chiesa, 2017). The circular economy ’s rising popularity in environmental policymaking builds upon the di ﬀusion of these industrial approaches through the realm of environmental governance. These business models prescribe a ‘posi- tivized waste management ’, which values waste ’s productive reuse as a resource across social, economic, and spatial policymaking. This paradigm shift allows governments to tackle several problems simultaneously: the rising scarcity and prices of raw materials, the consequential decrease of industrial productivity, and ever growing volumes of waste. Governments in Europe are increasingly concerned with recycling ’s social, economic, and environmental limitations. While national recycling rates have increased in Europe , recy-cling output remains a problem in many larger urban areas, where an average of just 19% of recyclablewaste is collected . In comparison with the EU average of about 44% in 2014, recycling rates in Amsterdam , Rotterdam , Paris/Ile de France  and London  remain low. 3 Although city-regional governments are very concerned with the current state of solid waste recycling,this has had little e ﬀect on industrial productivity. In addition, waste recycling in city-regions has been unable to meet ambitious governmental climate targets, despite urban agglomerations being a primaryfocus of these policy goals. Recycled materials are of lower quality; have high environmental prescriptionsin the case of chemicals, electronics, and heavy metals; and establishing the infrastructure required to pro- duce them remains more expensive than importing raw materials. In particular, the recycling of construction and demolition waste —the second source of waste after water —is still largely underdeveloped in Europe. Finally, recycling requires the continuous enlargement of waste facilities, and permanent energy input, which produces emissions. These present signi ﬁcant problems for city-regional governments, especially con- sidering that waste output in city-regions is increasing with the overall enlargement of the ‘stock ’of products in the economy —the amount of ‘stuﬀ’that is produced, imported, and then wasted (Schmidt J.H & 2.-0 Con- sultants, 2009). Given recycling ’s limitations, policymakers have begun experimenting with w aste-as-resource approaches, primarily in North-Western Europe, where land ﬁlling has been progressively reduced. In the mid-2000s, waste-as-resource approaches came to closely resemble current circular policymaking, especially when applied to urban areas and household practices . These approaches addressed the limits of recy- cling by regulating waste as a resource for urban communities. In building of a socio-cultural program of ‘environmental stewardship, ’they involved non-governmental associations and households (Pollans, 2017 ,p . 4). The state ’s role, in this paradigm, is to encourage individual households to engage directly in waste proces- sing, promoting a culture of responsible consumerism and reuse. Governmental concern with recycling rates, and how urban areas and households manage waste, are impor- tant but ultimately insu ﬃcient factors in explaining why the circular economy has become a strategic target — both nationally and internationally, among both states and industrial groups. Today ’s policy programs are shaped by the need to address resource scarcity and maintain high productivity levels in digital services, chem- istry, hi-tech, and knowledge. The increasing prices of the most important raw materials, as de ﬁned by the European Commission, indicate that the continent is approaching a critical tipping point, after which key resources for the post-industrial economy will become increasingly scarce . Especially rare materials include Magnesium ; Antimony ; Vanadium (used by the building industry and in engines); and platinum group metals, which are essential for producing solar panels, wind tur- bines, and ensuring energy e ﬃciency more generally. The prices of these rare materials have tripled between 2002 and 2016. 4These materials, which are imported from other continents , are irreplaceable in the production of energy infrastructures, smart transport networks, automated systems, and digital networks.Digitalization, automation, and electri ﬁcation are strategic targets for climate programs at the EU level, and depend on cities ’capacity to recover metals from existing e-waste . These trends indicate the broad context of circular economic approaches. As a socio-economic program, these approaches combine three aims: to surpass recycling as an approach to waste processing (and not simply improve it); to develop a market for recovered materials and maintain productivity; and, as I go on to show, toJOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING 679 address CO 2reduction targets. The following section dissects three socio-spatial and economic processes that push towards these ambitions. Urban mining, logistics and ‘prosumption’ Three distinctive processes characterize an accumulation regime dependent on waste recovery. Circular econ- omy programs rede ﬁne urban development as a process of generating —not exploiting —resources (see Raw- orth, 2017). Building on early analysis of urban metabolisms, cities are presented as networks of material streams, in which one activity ’s waste becomes another ’s resource (Girardet, 2014; Kennedy, Pincetl, & Bunje, 2011). Regenerative urbanism —which encompasses design and economics —belongs to a paradigm of social, cultural, and infrastructural change in which the built environment is a source of materials, not their product. These models apply the notion of ‘upcycling ’waste materials —that is, their reuse before recycling —to buildings and infrastructures . Such practices include neighborhood based composting, urban agriculture, textile re-manufacturing, 3D-printing using recycled plastics, communityenergy trusts, and food waste coops . Urban mining translates regenerative urbanism principles into industrial practice. It envisages an industry geared to recovering materials from anthropogenicactivities in urban agglomerations . A key pillar of circular economic policymaking, urban mining is regenerative urbanism ’s industrial counterpart. Chemical and metal sectors use it to recover materials that, although present in cities, are unlikely to be recycled. Metals are recovered from obsolete elec-tricity networks and underground pipes, while chemicals and concrete are recovered for use in the building andregional food industries . Both urban mining and regenerative design, as I later argue, suggest a rescaling of waste and resource governance from national and international to localscales. They re ﬂect a devolution of the governance of materials in city-regions, implemented through national-urban deals, that allows cities to better control waste recovery, collection, and reuse. A second distinctive process of an accumulation regime dependent on waste valorization is the shortening of supply-chains that move materials recovered from waste. Historically, the circulation of waste materials —such as water, domestic waste, chemicals and metals —has been ‘fragmented ’and‘unbundled ’in post-fordist urban- ization . This has made waste processing not only costly, but also very uncom- petitive relative to raw material imports. Urban waste processing was largely unpro ﬁtable for regional companies . This resulted in a highly sectoral urban infrastructure, paralleled by a variety of semi-autonomous public, private, and semi-private ﬁrms managing speci ﬁc material ﬂows. Cir- cular economic models target this inadequate waste supply chain, which they suggest should be replaced by a‘nexus infrastructure ’able to bridge di ﬀerent material streams . Logistics is the prime sector advocating a networked infrastructure. As a sector, logistics governs distri- bution, processing, and shipment in dense urban agglomerations. In a market of mass consumption dependenton global supply chains, freight and cargo logistics are crucially important . Current circular econ- omy models prescriptions a greater circulation of materials, goods, and waste speci ﬁcally within city-regions . The Ellen MacArthur Foundation —a major advocate of circular economy in the corporate sector —explicitly foreground reverse logistics —logistics that connect con- sumed goods/waste back to producers —as a ‘rationale ’for circular policymaking (Ellen MacArthur Foun- dation, 2013). Such programs highlight potential business opportunities, such as customized consumption supply chains; local re-manufacturing; city-regional agriculture; and bio-economy. They call for investments in the infrastructures necessary for distributing products in the circuits of sharing and second-hand economies, mostly at the regional scale. This kind of regionalization puts logistics ﬁrms already positioned in the material distribution sector in a pivotal governance position. Thus, the transition towards circularity is enabled by investments in infrastructure that are primarily carried out by air-cargo providers, airports, waste and water companies, industrial consortia in chemistry, freight transporters, storage facilities providers, and network pro-viders. As I show, these ﬁrms are some of the main advocates of circular economy in the private and utility sector.680 F. SAVINI The third distinctive process of accumulation under the circular economy is the structural re-articulation of consumption and production processes in cities. The rescaling of logistics markets characterizes a regime of accumulation in which ‘one producer ’s wastes become another ’s inputs ’. The notion of the ‘prosumer ’captures this shift. Individuals are ‘more than users or consumers ’: they become makers of the resources needed for their own consumption practices . The ‘pro- sumer ’belongs to an economic system in which the two formerly distinct processes of production and con- sumption temporally and spatially overlap . As such, the concept has been fruitfully used to explain the role of users in the search engines industry. As a material prosumer, the individ-ual’s act of consuming a particular good —such as a phone, with its electronics, or t-shirt, with its fabric —pro- duces the necessary conditions of that consumption: in my example, reusable electronic materials or textiles. AsHobson  has suggested, prosumption has both social and geographical dimensions. The concept allows us to grasp the circular economy not exclusively as a technological or business program, but rather as a socio- cultural shift in consumerist society. Urban households, and the consumption and lifestyle practices they involve, actively partake in production processes. Prosumption is central to the rising commodi ﬁcation of waste, according to which household consumption is necessary for the production of new market commodities, which are distributed through systems of sharingplatforms, repairing spaces, re-manufacturing sites, fabrication ateliers, and product re-design . Located in dense urban environments, in close proximity with households, these activities often use digital sharing technologies. By engaging in sharing activities, households become prosumers in an econ- omy in which consumption equals production through waste . Prosumption encompasses a broad array of indi- vidual practices: sharing leftover meals; collecting urines and feces containing phosphates for regional agriculture; exchanging used clothes at nearby pop-up stores; collecting organic waste to make compost for local neighborhood ethanol production; sending obsolete appliances to nearby repair shops; and manymore. In the following sections, I reconstruct the legacy of circular economic policy programs in the Nether- lands and Amsterdam. Roots and legacy of a circular economy regime in The Netherlands The Dutch context o ﬀers an ideal case to explore the institutional and political impacts of the circular economy model in contemporary European economies. The Netherlands, above other European countries, has under- taken comprehensive policies at all scales, explicitly combining climate targets with a national strategy for sus- tainable growth. These policies, moreover, are applied to a densely populated country, in which urban agglomerations are expanding and energy, raw materials, and land are increasingly scarce. Since 2014, the Dutch government has started producing programmatic and strategic documents aimed at implementing numerous circular economy interventions, projects, pilots, and initiatives over the next 30 years.In 2014, the governmental program From Waste to Resource  marked a shift in the national waste processing paradigm, and recognized how ‘existing waste policy is targeted at mitigating the environmental stress of waste, while a circular economy requires seeing waste as a resource ’(my trans- lation). 5This comprehensive program, developed by the Ministry of Infrastructures and Environment, com- bines three strategic policy sectors that have previously been institutionally discrete: the increasingly urgent need for resource self-su ﬃciency and e ﬀective waste disposal; a transition away from fossil-based energy sources; and smart socio-economic growth, underpinned by eco-production and consumption. The program proposes numerous interventions, including pilot projects experimenting with new production and consump- tion processes. These projects aim to rede ﬁne waste regulations; institute national-local partnerships; establish specialized R&D for e ﬃcient product development in the food, building, and hi-tech sectors; and develop a new consumer culture by promoting reuse and sharing projects at the neighborhood level. The VANG policy framework results from a series of parliamentary briefs and motions that appeared in national policy debates in 2010 and 2011. The inter-ministerial ‘resource note ’6and ‘more value out of waste ’note  signaled that the government ’s intended to valorize waste streams and broadly reorganize supply chains to achieve resource independence. Both documentsJOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING 681 point out at that existing recycling procedures are inadequate, given expected waste increases —especially household, electronic, and construction waste. They highlight the importance of resource e ﬃciency in nation- ally strategic industries of hi-tech, agribusiness, logistics, creative industry, and construction. These sectors are identi ﬁed as especially crucial in the Dutch economy, in terms of both economic added value and job units. However, these sectors are also exposed to a high degree of risk in terms of raw materials supply, for their materials are still primarily imported from abroad. These political agreements represent stepping stones towards a national vision on the circular economy. They cut against an excessively international resource/waste cycle, which depends on global markets and frag-mented logistics, but also responded to changing national waste streams in a post-industrial economy. In the Netherlands, consumer-generated waste is increasing and producer-generated waste is decreasing. Between 1985 and 2014, in light of the country ’s steady increase of GDP, household waste increased by 60% while indus- trial waste decreased by 25%, the metal and food industries producing still most waste . 7Early Dutch circular economy policy briefs, then, combined the urgent need to grapple with both resource scarcity andincreasing consumption waste. In the Netherlands, most primary materials are employed in the food , construction , and metal  industries . These materials are not provided through traditional recycling techniques, and must be processed through material-speci ﬁc recovery systems, composted, or back ﬁlled. 8 Although the VANG program had little e ﬀect on recycling rates , it activates numerous initiat- ives across di ﬀerent sectors. Today, these constitute the policy network that has driven the fast positioning of the circular economy in national and local political agendas. In 2017 these initiatives were streamlined as part ofa nationwide circular economy program, called The Netherlands Circular in 2050 (Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment, 2016 ). Structured around ﬁve‘task forces ’, this program ’s organizes multi-level governance around initiatives in the biomass/food, remanufacturing, consumption, and building sectors. The initiativesinclude adjusting packaging regulations and producer responsibility; establishing data exchange platforms that promote the material recovery before recycling in the areas of resource, design, and product development ; educating children about waste ’s importance in primary schools; and, most importantly, the Circular Seaports program . Figure 1. Relative increase of waste generated by consumers and industries  in The Netherlands from 1985, next to GDP growth. Source: author ’s adaptation from National Waste Management Plans .682 F. SAVINI This national partnership between Rotterdam and Amsterdam harbors connects multiple material streams  in existing harbors areas. These initiatives are carried out through inter-sectoral and multi-level contracts among public governments; start-ups in the product design and energy sectors; and industrial groups in the hi-tech and energy sectors . Since 2011, the Dutch government has been developing a multi-levelcross-sectoral governance strategy, geared towards experimenting with innovative projects in urban agglomera- tions. It has signed a total of 200 ‘green deals ’and 18 city-deals: contracts for schemes trying out innovative solutions for green economic growth. Among these, 40 deals address the circular economy, waste reuse, inte- grating material streams, and developing a bio-based economy. In building national-urban-business coalitions around these issues, the deals combine approaches to supply chain management, business modeling, and urban infrastructuration . They create a form of waste governance that is more decentralized and multi-sectoral than previously. They also include partnerships with several environ- mental associations. Alongside promises of new certi ﬁcation systems and subsidies that disincentive incinera- tion, these deals are particularly oriented to establish partnerships between start-ups in data and freight logistics, urban waste departments and infrastructural providers. 9 This expansion of policy initiatives has now been fully institutionalized in the governmental policy package on climate. The so-called Climate Agreement i saﬁrst attempt at streamlining all the national policies necessary for achieving the target of reducing CO 2emissions by 49% in comparison to the 1990s by 2030. The circular economy ﬁgures as a strategic priority in three key areas: the reduction of CO 2in the country ’s growing building industry; the shift from fossil-based to biomass and biogas energy sources; and the reduction ofall primary raw materials used in the economy by 50% . The Task Force Circular Economy —one among 6 groups designing the program —is elaborating strategies to increase food and organic waste reuse for biomass and biogas. Its key members are national chemical, electronic, and building ﬁrms, which mean to invest in a bio-based economy for electronics and chemicals . 10 Under the name Urban Mining Collective , these ﬁrms are forming a national advocacy coalition, which aims to promote the recovery, not recycling, of construction residuals, metals, e-waste, and chemicals.11 A major challenge faced by the Netherlands in reducing its CO 2production is the creation of a bio-based economy, dependent on biomass and biogas. Such an economy would address the country ’s dependence on gas. Gas covers about 50% of all energy supply in the Netherlands, produces 11% of all CO 2,and provides heat- ing for 95% of the country ’s total housing stock. Renewables constitute only 10% of total supply. The govern- mental strategy for realizing a circular economy in achieving its climate targets has to be placed in the context ofan energy transition in which renewable energies do not adequately meet current energy demands. The circulareconomy would substitute the country ’s largest energy source —ground gas —with another: waste, above all organic waste. Together, the Netherlands ’small but stable share of renewable energy; high ratios of, and capacity for incineration; and high volumes of organic waste from cities and agri-business has combined tomake valorizing waste a national target . 12 Urban logistics as market for the circular economy In rede ﬁning waste processing procedures, regulations, and infrastructures, these national programs require direct involvement from city-regional governments and waste processing ﬁrms. The national agreements described above consolidate a multi-level governance structure focused on valorizing waste streams fromand within urban environments. It does so by strengthening and developing niche markets for diﬀ erent sorts of waste management, processing, and collection. The city of Amsterdam formed a pioneering policy network including national programs, visions, agree- ments, and strategies for the circular economy. Since 2008, governing political parties in the municipal execu- tive formed a green growth coalition around early principles of ‘circularity ’. This coalition addressed regional growth by tackling the e ﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis on the city ’s‘real’economy, namely the building, food, and logistic sectors. The parties agreed an agenda that experimented with combining principles ofenvironmental qualities  with aJOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING 683 resource-based economy , while protecting logistics businesses.13The 2011 Amsterdam Integraal Duurzaam document was the ﬁrst policy package to combine priorities of resource independence, renewable energy, and real-estate development in the aftermath of the global ﬁnancial crisis. It promoted con- crete investments in organic waste  and energy streams, so as to valorize the materials produced in the city region, particularly residual heat from incineration. This document anticipated the Amsterdam circularmetropolitan area policy  and its follow-up, the Circular Amster- dam policy program . These programs identi ﬁed those sectors in need of ‘full circularity’ : the building industry, water circle, food circle, and biomass. The latter was de ﬁned as a sustain- able  energy supply for the city. These programs ’aimed to e ﬃciently match supply and demand of  materials in the region. In the ﬁrst unitary circular policy-making program in Amsterdam , city o ﬃcials envisaged an increase productivity rates by 3% in the building sector and generate 1200 new jobs in the biomass and organic waste sectors . 14To these ends, they identi ﬁed two necessary interventions: improving the digital infrastructure of data servers and software platforms, so as to facilitate information sharing about material streams in the city-region; and strengthening return logistics, smart freight transportation, and electric mobility. An especially central role is accorded to the largest existing city logistic services, which, for the time being, have been formally privatized as municipally-owned companies.These are the harbor company , which manages the harbor industrial area and its underground infrastructure, and the waste and energy company , which produces energy from incin- eration. As landowners and infrastructure owners, these ﬁrms are the prime advocates for the circular economy in Amsterdam. Yet they are also in coalition with a growing network of start-ups in data-logistic services, life- cycle assessment ﬁrms, material accounting, and waste processing, as I discuss in the next section. The logistic sector is both the target and driver of the circular transition, both locally and nationally. In the notion of the circular economy, this sector espies a mode of economic development that reacts to decreasingindustrial productivity and changing global consumer patterns. De ﬁned as ‘distribution country ’(Dutch Gov- ernment, 2019 ), the Netherlands aims to become a world leader in logistics performance, despite the volatility of the logistics market over the last decade, following a global economic downturn and changes in supply chains. 15 Locally, though, the logistics sector is growing. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2014, most logistics start-ups provided consumers goods transportation, taxi services, and road shipments. Businesses in these sectors have long been looking for more certainty in national and regional investments . More- over, in the urban-regional logistic sector investments in eco-e ﬃciency seem less risky and proportionally more eﬀective in reducing CO 2outputs . At a national level, the recently published proposal for a Climate Agreement identi ﬁes the logistic sector as a prime target for e ﬃciency invest- ments, suggesting investment in light shipments, such as e-cargo bikes; e ﬀective waste diversion infrastructures; e-commerce and sharing; and electric freight transport . Urban and data logistics are the sectors most involved in Amsterdam ’s circular economic growth policies. They combine industrial groups with small-scale start-ups working in areas of third party logistics, data man-agement, and business modeling. The Green Deal for Netherlands Hotspot for Circular Economy , which was signed in 2013, indicates how these companies partner together around waste recovery markets in Amsterdam city-region. The deal prototypes new regulations to be applied nationally. It involved Circle-Economy, a start- up managing data about material ﬂows; Amsterdam ’s Waste and Energy Company; the Ministry of Economic Aﬀairs; and Ministry of Infrastructures and Environment. The document envisaged a potential pro ﬁto f7 –12 billion euros in the circular economy, and devised a broad program of research and experimentation in the bio-based economy, and using residual heat recovered from waste incineration. Since 2013, the Amsterdam harbor—Europe ’sﬁrst coal and gasoline harbor —has started to reposition its role and industrial policy, de ﬁning itself as a‘connector ’for material streams, including waste-energy nexuses, construction materials, and e-waste (Port of Amsterdam, 2015). In 2015 it invested in a ﬂagship project featuring a circular incubator , in which start-ups in the circular sector could collaborate with larger bodies in chemical and material recovery. Two years later, in 2017, the harbor con ﬁrmed a partnership with logistic ﬁrms aiming to redevelop the underused land properties and infrastructures in the whole west side of Amsterdam region, the so called West-As . This684 F. SAVINI project is a private-led planning initiative promoted by the Amsterdam Logistic Board, a lobby group bringing together Schiphol airport, data-center providers, and a number of freight transportation ﬁrms to further develop the industrial belt of Amsterdam. In the project ’s manifesto –titled ‘it all revolves around the Westas ’16 –the board presents investments in the circular economy as necessary for boosting city-regional logistics. This, they stress, is the crucial sector in reconciling economic growth with ecological sustainability. These proposalsidentify areas prime for industrial redevelopment in the Amsterdam region, and propose building new logistic hubs in the city ’s periphery. Changing consumption/production practices: prosumption of waste in Amsterdam The spatial separation of sites where waste is generated  and those where waste is processed  is the structural result of a particular socio-econ- omic system in which waste materials occupied a negative position —as dirt or externality —in both consump- tion and production processes. In the accumulation regime of the circular economy, by contrast, waste becomesa commodity that is produced and consumed within the city. In a consumerist economy, the household is the prime site at which goods are consumed, waste generated, and raw materials recovered. The prosumption of waste occurs through an increased proximity between those sites at which waste is generated through consump- tion and those at which it is recovered through processing. I use the notion of prosumption to capture urbandwellers and consumers ’shifting position in justi ﬁcations of the circular economy as a model of city-regional economic growth. Circular economy programs in the Netherlands and Amsterdam began from two distinct but complementary directions. As I have described above, the national government has been producing programmatic documents about how the circular economy might address waste increase and resource dependency within its climate ambi- tions. At a local level, Amsterdam o ﬃcials have been prototyping projects experimenting with closed-loop neigh- borhood infrastructures; regional supply chains; and new waste and material cultures since mid-2000s. The ﬁrst uses of circularity in urban policy date back to the redevelopment of the Buiksloterham area, a mixed housing-industrial district adjoining Amsterdam ’s Central Station. Epitomized as a ‘circular living lab ’, the area became a benchmark project for circularity initiatives due to its peculiar mix of residential redevelopment and industrial activities in remanufacturing and design . Having sketched the ﬁrst plans for developing the underused shipyard, the project ’s proponents —a community of eco-activists, urban dwellers, and designers — built their houses from reused materials and established a closed-loop infrastructural system for water, compost,and energy. The initiative ’s leaders organized a community around principles of housing eco-e ﬃciency, eco-con- sumption, and sustainable lifestyles. They experimented with decentered wastewater treatment, o ﬀ-grid energy circles, and organic waste composting. Building on the success of these initiatives, in 2014 the city governmentbegan redeveloping a 10.000 sqm plot in collaboration with homeowners; housing corporations; and energy and water companies to experiment with closed-loop material streams. In this neighborhood, developers arenow testing new types of in-house sewage ﬁltering and composting. This so-called project City Plot became the benchmarking prototype for the circular vision of the city at large. Indeed, it is the only concrete exampleof circular neighborhood in the Amsterdam Circular document. It involved devising an integrated neighborhood, in which organic waste feeds energy and urban gardening; locally grown products could be purchase with local currencies; solar energy is stored and reused; and wastewater is used to store heat. 17 In these plans for circular living, households are portrayed as more than consumers (of energy e ﬃcient hous- ing): they are also producers of resources such as energy, water, hating, compost, and buildings. This position-ing of citizens is found across circular micro-projects in Amsterdam, a broad landscape of citizen-based micro- businesses and start-ups active in a ‘green ’repurposing, repairing, reusing, remanufacturing, and redesigning industry. Amsterdam ’s circular economy is anchored in the growing hype surrounding the city ’s so-called ‘makers industry’ or‘makers movement ’:ad iﬀuse network of start-ups involved in customized DIY production, digitalized manufacturing, and eco-conscious consumerism . This sector, which expanded during a period of real-estate downturn, combines start-up re-development with a culture of ecological entrepreneurialism that explicitly targets surplus materials, wasted products, and local production. In 2014,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING 685 35% of all Amsterdam ﬁrms were in the handicraft market, of which 60% produced art and consumable pro- ducts such as trinkets, ornaments, accessories, parts, clothes etc. Most importantly, this was the city ’s fastest growing sector during the recent period of economic crisis, with growth rates of 25% (relative to the national rate of 2%). This prosperity is largely concentrated in the region ’s inner core (Municipality of Amsterdam, 2015). The policy framework for this local commercial sector was labeled ‘Amsterdam Made, ’emphasizing a vital local manufacturing and material reuse economy. This label became central in a public campaign promot-ing best practices in eco-manufacture, which including tenders for innovative start-ups in material reuse, such as the DAM prize for circular businesses or the CIRCO, the nationwide design program for micro-business intextile repurposing. 18 These policy prototypes engage households in circular projects that include waste products that can be e ﬀec- tively managed by dwellers . Logistics, chemical,and waste industries are also starting to invest in processing these materials by building close links with con- sumers. An example is the partnership between the Amsterdam incinerator, Procter & Gamble and the small ﬁrm Fater, which reuses materials from used diapers, as collected by citizens in separate public bins . Similarly, the WASTED project in Amsterdam North, which, though initiated by a start-up, is now sponsored by the northern district government, requires that households monitor their paper and plasticwaste and use smart bins to obtain local currency. These activities are having a visible impact on Amsterdam:recent circular plans include a new waste-to-resource hub in the same district. Here, material separation tech- niques, repair cafés, re-design studios, and second-hand markets will be sited together. The underlying ambi- tion of these policies is to connect the macro scale of waste processing economies  with the circuits of consumption and small-scale production by households and companies in urban areas. As the Amsterdam o ﬃcial states during an interview: the ideal situation is to combine the old school industry or recycling businesses with initiatives that get a grip with the urban material streams. The large companies  are getting closer to the ‘laptops ’of the sharing plat- forms, the consumers in the city. The aim is to connect these two sectors that today are still apart.19 This micro-industry of waste production and consumption also has social, cultural, and aesthetic dimen- sions. It prospers from the beauti ﬁcation of waste, a process in which the residue consumerism is portrayed as not only manageable and pro ﬁtable, but beautiful and ecologically desirable too. The initiatives mentioned above make extensive use of public campaigns, which promote waste ’s positive aspects among urban dwellers.20 The city is also becoming the stage for the visual valorization of waste. In October 2017, Amsterdam city council hosted an exhibition named ‘Circular Expo ’, which was about circular design and material reuse. For its part, Waag Society, a major cultural institution in the city, has organized interactive urban mining workshops and 3D printing workshops featuring recycled plastic. Today, the Waag society remains at the forefront of the cir- cular debate in Amsterdam. In Rotterdam, the Boijmans Museum ’s‘Change the System ’exhibition featured works created entirely from plastic. Artistic artifacts made from waste are also found in Amsterdam, which sports Fatberg, an island of residual fat ﬂoating in the sea. These are more than artistic gestures: they highlight how circularity is being embedded in urban culture. These are just few among numerous examples of urban practices that build productive relations among urban dwellers and waste. They also suggest that the beauti ﬁcation of waste provides a crucial backdrop against which waste is valorized in the circular economy. The signi ﬁcance of the socio-cultural dimension of circularity lies in how it reveals the potential —as opposed to the danger —of discarded materials. At one level, the artistic display of garbage provides allegories for the environmental, social, and political problems on the planet (Lind- ner & Meissner, 2016, p. 3). At another, waste ’s beauti ﬁcation has come to justify its value. Within the circular economy, waste is paradoxically presented as a solution to the problem of overconsumption, not its cause. Questioning the nature of the circular economy This article has developed an encompassing account of the circular economy to explain why this notion hasdiﬀused so widely in environmental governance and policymaking. Deliberately refrained from theoretically686 F. SAVINI redeﬁning this volatile term, it has focused instead on questioning how circularity has been mobilized in environ- mental governance over the last decade. In doing so, it has sought to explain the underlying social, economic, and political drivers that are making the circular economy a policy hype across Europe. There is a broad agreement among European, national, and local government o ﬃcials—as well as environmental activists, environmental scholars, and industrial ﬁrms in various sectors —that a circular mode of development, in which all anthropo- genic waste is reused in new activities, might o ﬀer an alternative and achievable pathway to a sustainable econ- omy. This agreement is grounded on the assumption that a system valorizing waste as a resource will allow a particular region or country ’s economy to reduce the import and extraction of raw materials and energy to almost zero. Circularity involves reorganizing consumption and production to build a waste processing and recovery market that includes a large array of interventions. Common examples include the increasing incineration of bio- mass; reuse of nutrients in the regional agricultural economy; reuse of light metals in cable production; pro-motion of digital platforms for sharing production; and extraction of energy from wastewater. This article has taken the circular economy ’s new centrality in policymaking as the symptom of an emergent regime of capitalist accumulation that prospers by valorizing waste. It dissected the underlying processes bywhich waste is valorized in regional and national economies. Honing in on the Netherlands and Amsterdam, it has shown how the governmental need to recover material waste close to its source gave rise to early proto- types of circular economic policymaking. This occurred through three processes: ﬁrst, a combined governmen- tal and business concern with waste accumulation and raw material scarcity in a growing post-industrial consumption economy. States are seeking systemic approaches to meet demands for raw materials and simul- taneously rethink the modern paradigm of waste disposal and recycling, which is failing to cope with increasingwaste stock and relatively low recycling rates, especially in urban agglomerations. Circular economy provides an approach to economic development that makes one problem the solution of the other in a sustainable way. This is particularly evident in how biomass and biogas are now used to justify the value of organic waste as a long-term source of ‘green ’energy and bio-based raw materials. Second, the circular economy builds on existing attempts to rejuvenate and redevelop city-regional logistics markets. In the materials and goods transportation sector, processing and storage has not fared well in the tran-sition beyond fossil fuels, putting harbors, airports and other urban logistics hubs at the forefront of a circular transition. In this context, the adaptation of the logistics sector —which is actively seeking eco-e ﬃciency —has become a key target in national approaches to the circular economy. As such, the logistics sector is both the driver and target of circular economic policymaking. Finally, a regime of accumulation based on waste valorization builds on a particular social and cultural articulation of production and consumption processes. The popularity of circular economic policymakinghas risen in parallel with a culture of ecological production and consumption in which households circulate and reuse  waste materials. The notion of prosumption captures households ’emerging role in a new economy of materials, which is centrally important in closing urban chains of waste supply and demand. Through consumption, households are both producers of waste and consumers of reprocessed waste materials, which are revalued as new  commodities. They do so through practices of buying, dis- carding, separating, repairing, sharing, collecting, and repurposing consumable goods. This article has not argued that a new capitalist accumulation regime is now fully ﬂedged and instantiated. Neither it has questioned the urgency and virtue of the core principle of circularity, the reuse of all waste thatmight possibly be produced. It has aimed instead to pinpoint the policy processes through which waste materialshave acquired a new centrality in sustainable economic thinking. It has shown how current realizations of the circular economy are not concerned with reducing waste through progressive anti-consumerist policies. Current policy packages are a far cry from the radical principles of the circular economy ’s earliest applications. As Jackson  emphasized years before the circular economy became a widely recognized model, any dematerialization of the economy through circularity should prioritize demand-side interventions oriented towards reducing con-sumption in a ﬁrst place. Such interventions include both promoting an explicit anti-consumerist culture in households and true-pricing regulations in production. Current policy practice, in contrast, posits waste as the wellspring of economic production and consumption, a source of materials, a posteriori justi ﬁed as a strategy for meeting climate targets in a growing post-industrial economy. These policies indicate the limits of anJOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING 687 approach to circularity that is supposed to bring about a fundamental transition towards a dematerialized econ- omy. Instead, they justify a vicious co-dependency, in which waste accumulation and material/energy supplybypasses the more fundamental source of ecological problems: ever-growing consumer capitalism. Notes 1. Waste had a diﬀ erent position in premodern societies, in whose urban economies and living spaces it was more central and visible. 2. A further example of waste ’s economic marginality is the fact that economic and statistical accounting of waste has been fragmented until very recently. In the early 2000s, integrated systems of environmental economic accounting were estab- lished, along with life-cycle assessment tools and detailed categorizations (which discriminated, for instance, ‘waste ’from ‘residue ’or‘emission ’. 3.  see also ( https://www.lwarb.gov.uk/ wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LWARB-International-recycling-rate-comparison.pdf ) It is important to note that the values reported here are for SMW and household waste only, and that there are discrepancies among diﬀ erent databases. Com- parative data varies signi ﬁcantly, depending on accountancy models. See also Seyring, Dollhofer, Weißenbacher, Bakas, & McKinnon, 2016 . 4. All prices and rates of recycling can be found in the European Comission ’s study of Critical Raw Material . For example: Antinomy increased from 6000 to 14,000 US dollars per ton between 2009 and 2011; Platinum ’s price has under- gone a volatile quadruple increase between 2001 and 2007; Palladium’ s price has doubled in the same period. These ﬁgures also reﬂ ect the fast development of mining industry in countries like China, and are susceptible to the recent uptick in pro- tectionist economic strategies. 5.

The Netherlands has a very high incineration capacity in Europe, with Amsterdam being one of the largest incineration plants on the continent. The country imports waste from abroad, and biomass from other continents too. Moreover, in2010, waste incineration was labelled a ‘useful use’ of waste. The share of organic waste burned in Amsterdam is about 70%. Paradoxically, this makes incineration a useful and sustainable mode of managing waste. 13. One of the very ﬁrst appearances of the term circular economy was at the event organized by the central-conservative party CDU on 13 October 2009 at the Tolhuistuin. Here, the party ’s sustainability advisor  Marieke van der Werf was invited to present the cradle-to-cradle concept for the future of the city economy. The eventwas described as a milestone in our interview with the city ’s former alderman, Maarten van Poelgeest, on 6 March 2018. 14. . 15. Currently, logistic covers 3.5% of the Netherlands ’total GDP .  The largest volumes of waste-goods transferred are in the high-tech industry  and organic-agri-food sector , the most dynamic in terms of circular supply chains. 16. . 17.

Similar initiatives can be found in other European cities that have politically embraced the idea of a ﬁne grained circular economy of cities, such as the Greenbizz incubator promoted by Regional Program for Circular Economy in Bruxelles, the large Halle2 repair café in Hamburg or the Upcycle city contest in Almere, just next to Amsterdam. 19.
