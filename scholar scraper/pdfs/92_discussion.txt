As has been argued, food waste management is far from circular. By spotting and analysing interruptions of the circle, we ‘un-blackbox’ (Graham and Thrift, 2004: 8) the practices upholding the CE, while recognizing the make-up work done: mobilizing citizens’ respon-sibility, capitalizing on workers’ tacit skills, as well as covering unsustainable energy use. The empirical contribution of the present article is that it pays attention to interruptions, leaks, inflows and practices along the waste chain, and how they are handled at the micro-level in order to ‘keep the circle’. In the first step, we detect a number of the social and material strategies used to produce as much ‘clean’ waste as possible, including neat dis-posal rooms, information campaigns and brown bags handed out, accompanied by tips on how to use them and avoid disgust. Materiality matters when fostering citizens to produce clean waste, thus enabling further processing. In the second section, we focus on how waste is carefully transformed into potent slurry. Not all food waste ‘behaves’ in the same way, and the waste workers develop a ‘feeling for the slurry’, which helps them to dose and mix the messy stuff. In other words, the make-up work performed entails a careful mix of raw materials to produce valuable slurry. In the third step, we visit the biogas plant. At this point, the main make-up work concerns the act of juggling supply and demand: both the surplus and lack of gas might interrupt the view of the valuable gas as a ‘sustainability object’ (Corvellec, 2016). Again, the right mixture is required to acquire a pure product. The slurry needs to be mixed with grease and manure to get the right degree of wetness and the right conditions for the methane-producing bacteria to thrive. In addition, the refined gas might need to be blended with natural gas to enable an even distribution on the market. Balancing supply and demand to uphold the flow and securing value is demanding, but potentially profitable work. Taken together, this analysis demonstrates the particularities of the creative and moral work of transforming degraded household food leftovers into valu-able commodities – and re-devalued outflows. The moral commitments expressed by the interviewees is crucial to the CE (Gregson et al., 2015).
The particular analytical contribution we bring to the field of waste studies is the 
concept of make-up work. With its focus on practice, the concept allows us to understand
