Rue Augustin Fresnel Metz France Corresponding author Tel Email address paulstiefensameu Abstract In todays business environment the trend towards more product variety and customization is unbroken Due to this development the need of agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families To design and optimize production systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches product analysis methods are needed Indeed most of the known methods aim to analyze a product or one product family on the physical level Different product families however may differ largely in terms of the number and nature of components This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the productionsystem A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture The aim is to cluster these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable assembly systems Based on Datum Flow Chain the physical structure of the products is analyzed Functional subassemblies are identified and a functional analysis is performed Moreover a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph HyFPAG is the output which depicts the similarity between product families by providing design support to both production system planners and product designers An illustrative example of a nailclipper is used to explain the proposed methodology An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach The Authors Published by Elsevier BV Peerreview under responsibility of the scientific committee of the th CIRP Design Conference Keywords Assembly Design method Family identification Introduction Due to the fast development in the domain of communication and an ongoing trend of digitization and digitalization manufacturing enterprises are facing importantchallenges in todays market environments a continuingtendency towards reduction of product development times andshortened product lifecycles In addition there is an increasingdemand of customization being at the same time in a global competition with competitors all over the world This trend which is inducing the development from macro to micro markets results in diminished lot sizes due to augmenting product varieties highvolume to lowvolume production To cope with this augmenting variety as well as to be able toidentify possible optimization potentials in the existing production system it is important to have a precise knowledgeof the product range and characteristics manufactured andor assembled in this system In this context the main challenge inmodelling and analysis is now not only to cope with single products a limited product range or existing product familiesbut also to be able to analyze and to compare products to define new product families It can be observed that classical existing product families are regrouped in function of clients or features However assembly oriented product families are hardly to find On the product family level products differ mainly in two main characteristics i the number of components and ii thetype of components eg mechanical electrical electronical Classical methodologies considering mainly single products or solitary already existing product families analyze the product structure on a physical level components level which causes difficulties regarding an efficient definition andcomparison of different product families Addressing this Procedia CIRP The Authors Published by Elsevier BV This

quantity is expected to be nearly million tons Barra and Leonard which is alarming It is high time that we must make some changes in the way plastic products are being used The Circular Economy brought a revolutionary change for plastic waste management Circular Economy emphasizes on zero waste methodology by innova tion and rethinking design to increase product life cycle for better use and less frequent waste reusability and recyclability in all ways possible so that the waste would not end up in landfills or marine litter The World Economic Forum also introduced The New Plastic economy which pointed out how plastic rethinking and redesigning will make major implications World Economic Forum Europe has also signed the Plastic Pack which aims to make plastic life circular for better tomorrow Plastic The F acts The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section is devoted to the literature review and plastic and their types are discussed in Section Section focuses on the generation and wastage of plastic industry wise Section proposes our model for Circular Economy in plastics used in Packaging Industries Section supports the model by creating an AHP model to identify the best plastic waste collection method we should employ for achieving Circular Economy Section presents a case study of Circular Economy used to convert waste plastic in high grade fuel Literature Review A literature review has been done on the circular economy plastic waste management and circular economy of plastics on search engines like Springer Taylor and Francis online Emerald Insight and from Google scholars Several general articles and videos illustrating the concepts of plastic waste and how circular economy can help reduce them are being studied Bozena Mrowiec pointed out the assumptions and action plans for making the Circular Economy plan work for Plastics based on the European Commissions plan introduced in Performance indicators have been developed for assessing the Circular Economy of bioplastics and how they can be more beneficial than conventional plastics Spierling S Venkatachalam V Behnsen H Herrmann C Endres HJ Effects of Black Plastic single use packaging

Thermogravimetry for plastic waste decomposition as a method The c ircular economy has to go hand in hand with the safety of the users in case of recycling and reusability especially in plastics where the renewed product has to be hazard free for use in grocery products Tom Keijer Vincent Bakker and J Chris Slootweg Industry Wise Distribution of Consumption and Waste Generation of Plastics Because of multiple characteristics and properties possessed by plastics they are used in almost every market sector Some of the sectors which have a large share of plastic usage are building and construction consumer products electronics and electrical appliances packaging automobiles sector etc Talking about the global plastic production and generation by market sector packaging is alone responsible for percent of plastic production and percent of plastic waste generation Geyer IHS Markit Report data tells us that the packaging sector is responsible for around percent of usage as shown in Figure and percent of waste generation Since the packaging industry is responsible for almost half of the waste generation while rest industries combined is possible rest half we have chosen to take the packaging industry as our prime focus to study the recycling a nd reusability for creating a circular economy of plastic In the packaging industry four types of plastics are used almost percent of the

Author name Procedia CIRP consulted by Post Graduate students Professors and Professionals in Civil Engineering Table is the final result obtained which shows us Deposit and Refund plastic waste collection method should be chosen over others for given alternatives and in the sense it is was we were pretty much expecting because the idea of choosing the waste collection method is not only to create a clean environment but to also create some sort of economy from the waste which will work both ways ie helping the society in terms of monetary help or goods exchange and helping governing bodies to collect the plastic waste for their better us e Although this solution is the best one for current situation our aim to form a perfect Circular Economy is adapt refusing the Plastic based products in the first place But because of numerous physical and economical properties of Plastic thats not go ing to happen spontaneously it will be incremental change which we all have to take for making earth a better place to live Case Study Rudra Environmental Solutions Jejuri Pune MH INDIA Rudra Environment Solutions is a company that is transfo rming plastic waste into a poly fuel using thermo catalytic depolymerization which can be used for burning without any further processing in households and companies India alone generates tons of plastic every year which makes it the th largest plastic waste producer In the broader category plastic is segregated into thick plastic and thin plastic Thick plastic can be recycled very easily but thin plastic also known as multi layer plastic MLP ends up in landfills most of the time Rudra President Medha Tadpatrikar took the matter in her own hands and started finding the solutions to make something valuable from the plastic waste They talked to many chemicals mechanical and polymer engineers who are working with plastics Then they came to a thought that if the plastic is made of crude oil why cant we reverse it After many failed experiments they adapted a technology that generates highgrade fuel from plastic waste which has high calorific value and is more environments friendly at a mere cost of Rupees per liter The poly fuel generated has a Sulphur output of ppm in comparison to diesels ppm output They created a kg plant in Jejurioutskirts of Pune MH India which later converted into a kg capacity plant The next challenge for them after creating this technology was to collect plastic from across the area For that Rudra Founders decided to collect the plastic waste on their own which will be multilayer beneficial which is the plastic collection for the enviro nment safety and their plants use They have adopted an important concept of segregation at source means separating different types of plastic waste at its source so that they dont end up in landfills They created a cycle of the collection in which residents put their plastic waste at a predefined location and once a day the waste gets collected Proper education has been provided to residents about the harm and cause of plastics waste and how to segregate plastics at home After reaching plant plastic is segregated by hard and soft plastics Their shredding process is done separately and then they get fed to the reactor where an anaerobic reaction happens which yields almost of poly fuel with of synthesis gas which can be reused in the proc ess and a bit of char or sludge which is used in the construction of roads of plastic waste is recycled by this process Current Plant of kg Capacity in their Jejuri Pune Factory The plant is able to process plastic waste that is not easily recyclable including wrappers other thin plastic and residual plastic waste material from businesses and households Each ton of plastics produces approximately to lite rs of fuel Around fuel used in the process Only to synthetic gas used in the process which is very good in comparison to other processes Merely to moisture is used in the process to Residual cha r can be used as road filler w ith bitumen One more fascinating work of Keshav Sita trust is creating awareness of waste plastic segregation at source Collects waste plastic from more than households in and around Pune Other Collection areas include Thane Dombavali Baramat i Bhimashankar and nearby forts Till date they have collected more than MT of waste plastic that is Saving of lakh KG of emission Rudra has helped companies so far to install their technology in their respective campuses and is aiming for more Their model is sustainable circular and ecofriendly Conclusion In growing world use of plastic is exponentially increasing with this the major problem is plastic waste which increase drastically with use of plastic Environmental concern associated with plastic waste has incited the research in sustainable energy in which circular economy playing major role for recycling the plasti c waste and make it use again without extracting natural resources In this paper different types of plastic are covered along with their uses and recycle stages To find the best waste collection method using multiple criterias we have used Analytical Hierarchy process AHP for decision making AHP is an effective method to deal with complex MCDM problem Best waste collection method is found out in accordance with less social and environmental impact low operation cost and ease of sorting Here AHP is used mainly to weigh criteria and purposed most preferable among the studied waste collection methods Sub criterias such as VC CC DOC BBC and D R Best among these is found out using AHP which supports main criterias Results stated that deposit or re fund method is best option among all DR method effectively collects the waste and some monitory gains are also possible Overall this paper helps to achieve circular economy for plastic waste management
