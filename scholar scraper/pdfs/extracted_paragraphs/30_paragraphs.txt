Using waste mana gement data from 27 councils in Egypt and  two different PAYT methods  under three case scenarios,  this study documents that the prepaid bag system un der the volume-based PAYT method leads to  the lowest waste costs and creates more incentives for households in terms of economic, social  and environmental benefits. These findings have var ious implications for the policy makers,  government councils, waste managers, businesses and  communities in the adoption of volume  based PAYT schemes for cost-effective, profitable a nd socially acceptable reusing and recycling  of waste. Such valuable addition to MW management c an contribute to the environmental and  socially sustainable development in emerging market s and in moving towards a circular economy  model.

Journal Pre-proof 1   1. Introduction and Overview  From the circular economy perspective, this study e xplores an advanced costing approach  under the ‘Full Cost Accounting’  called ‘Pay- As-You-Throw’  pricing model for  municipal waste  management in the Egyptian mun icipal councils to assess their dynamic  cost efficiency in resource recovery from MW system s. The circular economy concept presents  the integration of economic activity and environmen tal wellbeing in a sustainable way and is  gaining weight as an alternative to the ‘make, use,  dispose’ paradigm (European Commission,  2011). The recent ‘Global Waste Management Outlook’   has estimated about 7-10  billion tonnes of solid waste generation each year from urban households, commerce, industry  and construction activities  w hich poses a severe threat to the  environment and ecosystems. The entrenched linear e conomic activities in depleting natural  resources that began in the 17th century industrial  revolution has ignored the long-term  environmental damage causing high social and enviro nmental cost to the society. The linear  economy exclusively focuses on economic need with t he core principles of ‘take, make, dispose’  over exploiting resources and technological innovat ions for economic growth. Linear economy  models involve extracting resources and using them to make products and then disposing them in  landfill. In contrast, the concept of the circular economy replaces the ‘dispose’ aspect with  ‘repair, refurbish, recycle’ by giving circular cri teria to the life cycle of the products. It emerged   as a paradigm shift with core principles ‘take, mak e, reuse’ that respond to environmental and  societal needs while using natural resources. A cir cular economy values resources by keeping  materials and products in use for as long as possib le. Such a shift to a circular economy model  requires eco-innovations of resources to manifest t he needs of environmental resilience, despite  the tendency towards economic growth  .     The circular economy allows the value of resources,  materials, and products to remain on  the marketplace for as long as possible, minimizing  waste and the use of resources. Maximizing  the use and value of resources brings major economi c benefits, innovation and growth. However,  safe disposal and recycling of materials often rema in challenging for various reasons such as poor  management and enforcement, regulatory disparities,  lack of infrastructure and high cost of waste  recycle systems etc., which can have environmental and associated public health impacts. One of  the key outputs of diverse industrial and social ac tivities is waste management from production  activities and municipal sources. Although manageme nt of municipal solid waste is a priority in  Journal Pre-proof 2   urban cities, the methods used for collection and d isposal to date are far from perfect and cost  effective, meaning that solid waste is not disposed  of properly. Open dumping and burning  methods are used excessively and heavily pollute th e environment, endanger lives through the  spread of highly infectious and deadly diseases, cl og up sewerage systems and damage basic  infrastructure. In many countries including Egypt i n the Middle East and North Africa   region, and except for the majority of OECD countri es, the antiquated systems of collecting,  separating, weighing or sampling of solid waste and  disposal are irreparably damaging the  environment. Given that solid waste continues to be  generated at an abnormal rate, the challenges  are twofold –  the need for effective control an d disposal of waste for sustainable development,  and  to have cost efficiency benefiting all sta keholders for appropriate waste management.  From the perspective of solid waste management, the  cost effectiveness of separated waste  collection and proper management for identification  and separation of municipal waste  is a  key approach to promote the responsible use of wast e as an economic resource. According to the  principles of a circular economy, recycling implies  additional costs for separated MW collection.  The segregation and separation of household waste a t source have been identified as key waste  management methods to optimize MW management . While the  circular economy is a comparatively new concept wit hin the sphere of sustainability championed  by the Ellen McArthur Foundation starting in 2010 , the MW  sector appears to be one of the core integrated par ts among food, pollution and energy security  that can threaten all sustainability efforts from a  circular economy perspective (Stankovska and  Dimitrieska, 2017). Tisserant et al.  argue t hat innovative waste treatment methods  encompass the circular economy approach starting fr om waste generation until waste is reused  and/or recycled. The circular economy concept is ba sed on ‘take, make and reuse’ (see Egypt  Business Directory, 2018 for more details) with its  3Rs principle of ‘reduce or reduction, reuse  and recycling’ materials consisting of the characte ristics of low consumption, low emission and  high efficiency . Such a circula r economy framework clearly illustrates the  strong links between the environment and the econom y and the minimization of the primary  natural resource use . It emphasizes a combined view of the three main  aspects i.e. environment, resources and economic be nefits  to achieve  the ultimate goal of ‘zero waste disposal’ via the reuse, repair, restoration and recycling of  existing materials and products and ensures that re sources return to the value chain after use of a  Journal Pre-proof 3   product. Reusing and recycling of waste can also si gnificantly contribute to environmental and  social sustainability.   While resource recovery or saving from municipal wa ste systems does require the cost- benefit analysis being economically feasible, achie ving ‘cost efficacy’ is the key to promoting  the responsible use of MW management as an economic  resource that benefits all stakeholders.  From management accounting perspectives, cost effic iency is the priority in dealing with  operational activities relating to MW for sustainab le development. In other words, the solutions  of MW management should not only be environmentally  sustainable but should also be cost- effective, profitable and socially acceptable . However, lack of  accurate information on actual waste composition, c ollected and treated is one of the main  barriers to waste management planning . So, the growing demand for  information in business and society is driving acco unting to become progressively complicated  and integrated with organizational, economic and so cietal processes and activities. The much  more important development aspect is the interactio n between accounting including  sustainability accounting and reporting  and sustainability-related issues such as  food security, pollution, and energy security. None theless, little is understood concerning such  interaction . This is more challenging for an emerging economy  like Egypt as compared to a developed economy. The application of FCA, under the umbrella of  Environmental Accounting Management tools, helps to  integrate environmental and social  sustainability matters into decision-making. Nadeem  et al.  contend that FCA can  effectively measure both direct and indirect costs and benefits  of an  organization that leads towards the transition to a  circular economy. While a number of FCA  methods and tools have emerged over the last two de cades with different goals and scope of the  assessment, the FCA method of this study on MW in E gypt is more aligned with the United  States Environmental Protection Agency’s  method for FCA that includes  externalities in the cost/benefit assessment. These  externalities are real costs to society, but they  are not reflected in the price of MW services . In fact, in the existing MW  pricing system in Egypt, the cost of external impac ts is borne by society/households and neither  business nor households consider or pay the full co st of MW services.   Therefore, the use of the advanced environmental co sting approach FCA, and in  particular the PAYT pricing model briefly described  below, allows shared responsibility and  Journal Pre-proof 4   benefit for municipal councils, businesses andhouse holds for recyclable commodities . In fact,  the application of waste management using PAYT sche mes reveals the effectiveness of PAYT  schemes in both costs and waste reduction that woul d support the transition to the circular  economy by providing a stable operating environment  for all stakeholders (consumers,  manufacturers, councils) and minimizing social and environmental costs to society. In waste  management systems, the main purpose of PAYT strate gies is to support a more sustainable  management of waste flows from an economic, social and environmental point of view. This is  usually based on the waste hierarchy process to pro duce lower flows of waste, first by both  reducing polluted waste at source and re-using prod ucts and, secondly by increasing recycling  rates by avoiding landfill. Such PAYT application g enerates economic benefits as well as  environmental benefits in terms of both waste reduc tion and increased recycling rates  . Thus, the main  scientific  research question is to investigate an integrated sustainable framework for a PAYT  pricing model designed from an accounting perspecti ve, and then to explore the possible  implementation methods of a PAYT program  in the Egyptian MW  management service. As a case study, the research s pecifically bases on the FCA method where  PAYT is modified and calculated for Egyptian munici pal councils (for details, see Figure 3 and  Equations 1-3). PAYT has two streams relating to co sts and benefits of the scheme. For waste  disposal, reuse and recycling purposes, on the one hand, the cost aspect follows the introduction  of a mandatory charge through fixed costs  for  construction and operational facilities and a  variable cost  including direct  and indir ect  costs for the reduction of waste  generation and increases in recycling rates. On the  other hand, the benefit aspect flows from food  saving value  consumed and reduced, recyclable  waste price , compost value  , energy saving value  and savings from greenhouse gas emission .  Considering both costs and benefits together, the t otal waste charge under a PAYT scheme (i.e.  fee collection or pricing) can be determined for ho useholds and businesses that eventually  integrates with sustainable development from a circ ular economy viewpoint. This is how the  application of FCA  can support transi tion to the circular economy by combining  both economic and environmental challenges and prov iding a stable operating environment.  The contribution of the present study firstly deriv es from the fact that the MW sector has a  strong public benefit component to reach the best M W management that result in the lowest cost  Journal Pre-proof 5   with highest circular economy benefits . In Egypt, the MW is not  separated or sorted at source before collection, bu t waste pickers remove recyclables at disposal  sites prior to collection processes by municipaliti es. The growing stream of MW in Egypt, either  solid or food wastes, requires a sustainable waste management strategy  (Egypt's Vision 2030  Website, 2016), in addition to raising people’s and  organizational awareness towards this problem  . To adopt separated waste c ollection schemes and for raising public  awareness, implementation of the PAYT accounting ap proach is essential. There are three  technical pillars to implementing the PAYT approach : identifying the waste generator, measuring  the waste amount that needs treatment, and unit pri cing per emptying household and/or per kg or  tonne. Both councils and households would get direc t benefits of a cost-effective MW  management system. Therefore, this study contribute s to highlighting the best collection method  that leads to the lowest cost and maximum benefit f or all interested parties in MW management  systems in Egypt by considering direct and indirect  benefits to achieve sustainability. A second  benefit is to support the design and the applicatio n of the effective PAYT accounting approach for  pricing MW collection systems in Egypt by integrati ng economic, environmental and social  aspects which are still lacking in the literature a nd in real practice. The proposed PAYT model  aims to fill this gap by designing an integrated fr amework to support policy makers and waste  managers in the adoption of PAYT schemes. It can cr eate substantial economic, social &  environmental benefits for industry, energy & food security, especially if it is managed properly  with reasonable implementation of an integrated sus tainable weight-based or volume-based  PAYT costing approach.  Such an accounting approach  is still lacking in the literature and real  practice in Egypt. Therefore, it is expected that t he paper would contribute to the reevaluation of  the current policy measures and the modification of  the pricing policy design for municipalities.  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 briefly highlights the  existing Egyptian municipal waste management and st rategic vision 2030 for adopting the  circular economy approach. Section 3 describes the methodology undertaken for an integrated  sustainable framework for the PAYT accounting model  for pricing MW collection systems,  Section 4 extends the comparative analysis of the r esults and discussion with a suggested PAYT  scenario implementation in Egypt (two suggested PAY T methods, i.e. weight-based pricing  model and volume-based pricing model, have been pro posed for implementation in Egypt).  Finally, Section 5 proceeds with conclusions of the  study.  Journal Pre-proof 6     2. Egyptian Municipal  Waste Composition and Strategic Vision 2030   The incremental growth in population, urbanization  and income will double food demand  over the next 50 years. On the other hand, the Food  and Agriculture Organization   estimates that food loss and waste  “in the Ne ar East and North Africa  amounts  to 250kg/capita/year valued at over USD60 billion/y ear, or USD120/capita (conservative  estimate). NENA natural resources lost due to FLW a mounts to 42km 3/year of water (food  production and supply chains), and 360 million ha/y ear of land” . In  Egypt, food losses of the available cereals between  harvesting and final consumption  range from  13% to 15% . Additionally, 29% of the loss of fresh vegetables occurs in Egypt at  post-harvest stage  . Therefore, edible and non-edible  food waste represents a  considerable proportion of MW in Egypt, as presente d in Table 1 below. Table 1 illustrates the  MW composition in Egypt compared with some develope d countries. It is clear from Table 1 that  Egypt’s MW differs considerably from that in develo ped countries. The reasons for this range  from lack of awareness and poverty to affluence in Egypt’s urban population. In addition, much  of the recyclables retrieved from MW occurs at vari ous stages.     Table 1: MW Composition by Country      Organic/  Food  Paper   Plastic   Glass   Metal   Other   World  46  17  10  5 4 18   Egypt  60 10 12 3 2 13  Australia  47  23  4 7 5 13   United States  25  34  12  5 8 16   France  32  20  9 10  3 26   Germany  14  34  22  12  5 12   Japan  26  46  9 7 8 12   Canada  24  47  3 6 13  8  Source: Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata   .     Again, from the circular economy perspective, reuse  and recycling are vital waste  management approaches. Waste management technologie s could reduce the environmental  impact of food waste with economic gains  by sorting, re-using, composting and  bioenergy. From the waste management perspective, l ess waste can save both money and energy  and it also means more efficient use of raw materia ls. Table 2 illustrates the recycled and  Journal Pre-proof 7   landfilled percentage of MW flows in different deve loped countries compared with Egypt. It is  evident from Table 2 that Egypt’s recycled MW and l andfill substantially differ from that in  developed countries. However, Egypt’s Strategic Vis ion 2030 (see Egypt's Vision 2030 Website,  2016) sets targets to reduce the percentage of haza rdous waste disposed after safe treatment  and/or recycling from 7% to 30% in 2020 and then to  100% in 2030. Concurrently, the  percentage of MW regularly collected and managed in  a suitable manner will increase from the  current 20%  to reach  40% in 2020   and then to 80% in 2030 . These MW management targets in  Egypt may lead the country through the circular eco nomy.

Methodology for Integrated Sustainable Framework  for PAYT Pricing Model using Full  Cost Accounting Approach for MW Collection System     As mentioned earlier, achieving cost efficiency is the key to promoting the responsible  use of waste as an economic resource that can benef it all stakeholders in any jurisdictions. MW  management needs to be environmentally sustainable as well as cost-effective. In this study,  different accounting approaches and case scenarios for sustainable MW management are  explored to find the most cost efficient and profit able approach. In doing so, from the  methodological perspective, Egyptian waste manageme nt data has been collected, firstly where  the primary information is mostly from websites, bo oks, journals, etc. as well as a lot of facts and  data from international and national reports. Secon dly, the FCA method is adopted as the basis of  Journal Pre-proof 8   analysis in this study where an integrated sustaina ble framework for the PAYT pricing model is  developed and designed. It is considered as the mos t effective collection system that has proven  to give the highest yield to boost sorting technolo gy such as focusing on the products design  stage  and designing Pay-As-You-Throw  schemes . Thirdly,  using the FCA method, three case scenarios are anal yzed and compared based on the PAYT  pricing model. These scenarios are:  PAYT is not  implemented,  PAYT is implemented  but no waste reduction occurs, and  PAYT is impl emented and waste reduction occurs.   It is noted that these case scenarios explicitly ex hibit the difference between the pricing  model without PAYT  and pricing mo del with PAYT .  In the absence of a PAYT scheme, the other pricing model is usually a household or commercial  ‘flat rate’ to be paid to the municipals for the wa ste management services. These fees mainly  depend on the commercial and non-commercial activit ies. In addition, there are fee charges to  informal garbage collectors and disposal of househo ld or commercial waste, while additional  one-off or recurring charges may also incur for lan dfill and burning facilities depending on the  need of household or commercial firms. In aggregate , the ‘flat rate’ pricing model (case scenario  A) appears to be more expensive than the PAYT prici ng model  for all  stakeholders, as evidenced in the case analyses for  scenarios A, B and C in sub-section 4.2  below. In fact, the former pricing model does not c apture the impacts associated with  environmental and social externalities. Further, it  is highlighted here that in this study, the case  scenario B refers to ‘traditional PAYT pricing mode l’ that extends to case scenario C as  ‘modified PAYT pricing model’ by integrating some d irect and indirect aspects of the economic,  environmental and social benefits. Although Figure2  below demonstrates the traditional PAYT  pricing model under the FCA method, this study exte nds it to Figure 3 below incorporating  environmental and social impacts  which is known as the integrated  sustainable framework for the PAYT pricing model. T he environmental and social impacts/benefits  range between direct to indirect ones derived from a modified PAYT pricing model. On one hand,  the direct social benefits could be related to food  saving, health, job creation and the recycle  waste market. On the other hand, the indirect envir onmental benefits are linked to improved air  quality, greenhouse gas emission and energy saving value.  The integrated sustainable  framework for the PAYT pricing model is reflected i n the case scenario C documenting solid  advantages over case scenario A and, to some extent , over case scenario B. As such, the  Journal Pre-proof 9   methodology is described below stating the applicat ion of the traditional PAYT pricing model  with relevant figures and mathematical equations an d then extends to the integrated sustainable  framework for the PAYT pricing model. Accordingly, the three case scenarios are analysed and  interpreted to identify the best cost-effective and  resource recovery or saving scenario that  supports sustainable development towards a circular  economy.     3.1 Application of PAYT pricing model  The main steps to follow in a PAYT system are the i dentification and measurement of  waste under the unit pricing model, as presented in  Figure 2 below. Alternative PAYT methods  have also been investigated in the literature, howe ver the single user service (door to door  collection) is more common for household MW collect ion services . According  to the classification proposed by the U.S. EPA ,  the costs include:  a) Up-front costs  which include the initial investment to purchase a nd establish the  essential equipment and technology to collect waste , such as vehicles. As well, it may cover the  cost of  public awareness information campaigns abo ut the new and updated MW service.   b) Operating costs  which include all costs that may vary with the was te collected,  transported and final disposal. Also, it covers wor kforce, fuel and purchase costs for garbage  bags, in addition to managing waste collection acti vities on a daily basis.    Figure 2: Main steps in a PAYT system        Unit Pricing  Model   User   Identification   Waste  Measurement    Fee   Collection  • Fixed contribution   .  • Mixed contribution     (fixed and variable  costs).   • Single user service  (door to door  collection)  • Multiple user service     • Volume-based  • Weight-based       Source: Modified from Elia et al. .      Journal Pre-proof 10   Adopting PAYT charging models which are defined as unit or variable rate pricing  models when applied in MW management systems, requi res evaluation for new organizational  issues which increases the waste management service  complexity level compared to the adoption  of flat charging models . Under PAYT models, each citizen must pay for the  overall service cost based on their actual quantity  of waste they throw away. The most popular  accounting system for MW management that applied PA YT strategies is the FCA method (Weng  and Fujiwara, 2011; Karagiannidis et al., 2008; D'O nza et al., 2016).1 Weng and Fujiwara,   evaluated the MW management system effective ness in Taiwan using an integrated cost– benefit analysis with more focus on financial cost effectiveness of MW systems. On the other  hand, Karagiannidis et al.  adopted the full cost accounting method to estimate the waste  management cost and household waste charges in Gree ce using different "polluter-pays"  scenarios, and D'Onza et al.  proposed a meth odology for calculating the full collection  costs from various waste types.  As this study’s analysis focuses exclusively on the  waste collection process, measuring  the full cost of collection activities requires est imating the direct and indirect variable costs  where the fixed costs are charged as a fee on elect ricity use in Egypt. The estimated direct costs  include the garbage bags, labour, vehicles and fuel  that are used or involved in the MW  collection activities.   Currently, two main approaches are used to define t he fee pricing/charging model. The  first approach is to calculate the fee based on a s ingle contribution that differs according to the  level of service consumption while the second appro ach is based on a mixed model where both  fixed and variable contributions exist. Thus, follo wing the basic charging model of Elia et al.  , a Municipal Waste Collection Fee  is charged to the i th  user where i is the  governorate/council which is based on two main comp onents defined in Eq. :     MWCF = FCF + VCF                                                         1 FCA generally refers to ‘the process of collecting  and presenting information for each available alte rnative, in order  to conclude to a decision, and may be considered in  terms of environmental, economic and social impact s. FCA aims  at recognizing, quantifying and allocating the cost  related to a process, or a product, by counting, w here appropriate  also, the environmental and social cost’ .  Journal Pre-proof 11   Where, FCF i is the fixed costs of the MW management service wh ich covers the basic  fee, and VCF i is the variable costs which covers the i th  user fee contribution. FCF i which is  generally estimated based on different parameters r ather than depending on the collected waste  from a user. For example, it may depend on net inco me of citizens, total number of residents in a  house, or the commercial/non-commercial activities of users, etc.   In this paper, FCF i is based on the estimated investment cost for the proposed program 2  by the Central Department of Waste Management of th e Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency   in 2014 to improve the MW system. Again, VCF i is estimated based on the actual  quantity of collected waste from the user which is defined in Eq. :      VCF  = Q   + ∑            Where Q NR  and Q j are, respectively, the quantity in tonnes from non- recyclable   and recyclable waste flow collected from the i user .  DC and IC are the unitary costs for direct and indi rect costs including garbage bags, collecting,  transporting, maintenance and tipping for final tre atment and/or disposal.  The inclusion of direct and indirect environmental and social costs/benefits in the MW  charging fee has been suggested by prior studies to  give a more comprehensive view for the local  governments about the integrated performance level of the MW management processes (for more  reading see Weng and Fujiwara, 2011). To do so, the  PAYT pricing model in Figure 3 uses the  FCA method. By applying FCA, it is possible to expa nd traditional PAYT models to involve  direct and indirect environmental and social benefi ts (which are considered as cost reduction or  savings) due to the impact of MW collection service s on other industrial activities and resources  such as food security, environmental pollution and energy security. Accordingly, Figure 3 below  presents the proposed integrated sustainable framew ork for the PAYT pricing model design using  the FCA approach.                                                      2 The proposed program covers the investment costs r elated to improving the MW system’s administrative and setup  costs; direct and indirect fixed costs. It includes  removal of accumulated solid waste; prevent furthe r accumulations  by improving the efficiency of collection and trans port; establish mobile and stationary transfer stat ions; control  dumpsites and improving its efficiency; establish c entres for waste recycling; and establish sanitary landfills. To  execute the proposed program, the estimated financi al allocations required are EGP3,2954 million in 20 14, which  reached EGP7,000 million in 2017 which is approxima tely USD437.5 million .

Each collection method such as door-to-door, curb- side pick-up, community bins, self-delivered, contr acted or delegated service has its advantages  and disadvantages. Single user service  is the most common for  household MW services . Egypt ha s been classified as a medium income country  with an average 62.5% collection rate . This indicates that  Egypt’s collection costs are high ranging from 50% to 80% of the MW management budget,  especially with the lack of community and household  participation. US-EPA  indicates the  typical MW management budget usually allocated is p resented in Figure 4 below.

Description of Results on Suggested PAYT Scenari o  Implementation in Egypt    Table 3 below presents the general MW management sy stem data in Egypt for the years  2015 and 2017. It reveals that the yearly MW genera tion rate is 22.9 million tonnes in 2017 while  the per capita generation rate is 235 kg/year and 0 .65 kg/day. With a weekly collection frequency,  the average direct variable cost in 2017 is USD21.1 2 per tonne and the indirect variable cost is  USD10.88 per tonne, i.e. total USD32. The estimated  fixed cost for improving the MW system is  USD437.5 million.  Now, assuming the year 2017 as an implementation ye ar, data have been collected from  27 Egyptian governorate/councils for their demograp hic municipal data, waste-production  , and financial an d market prices for recyclables. The database  spreadsheet is generated and developed, and essenti al calculations and assumptions are  considered to estimate all waste streams for the im plementation year 2017. That is, the unit prices  are calculated for waste to be recycled and the exp ected environmental and social  revenues/savings. The unit price is calculated for each PAYT accounting method (i.e. weight- based accounting using number of tonnes and volume- based accounting using number of prepaid  garbage bags) to calculate the potential costs/reve nues/savings, taking into account the potential  reduction in waste generated which is stated as an average of 35% (The Regional Solid Waste  Exchange of Information and Expertise Network in Ma shreq and Maghreb Countries, 2014).

From an  environmental perspective in Egypt, the reduction o f GHG per tonne appears to be highly  significant with a positive implication for all sha reholders.

Again, the total municipal waste collection fee  is calculated with fixed   and variable  costs  that should be  charged for each tonne. Table 5 below  presents the results for the two different stages/a spects (i.e. before and after implementing  PAYT) on their different VCF cost  for c ollecting, transporting and final disposal. It is  noted that the difference between them is the prepa id bag cost per tonne .  Table 5 shows the percentage of recyclables is 44% while non-recyclables is 56% for the 27  Egyptian governorate/councils. The direct and indir ect costs for the former are USD9.29 and  USD4.49 per tonne and for the latter USD11.83 and U SD6.09 per tonne. For recyclable waste,  the total variable cost per tonne before implementi ng PAYT is USD14.08 while for non- recyclable waste, it is USD17.92. In total, the var iable cost per tonne before implementing PAYT  is USD32 and after implementing PAYT is USD44.5, wh ich includes USD12.5 for prepaid bag  costs per tonne for both recyclables and non-recycl ables.

To compare results, the two PAYT accounting methods  are differentiated (i.e. weight- based accounting using number of tonnes and volume- based accounting using number of prepaid  garbage bags) by applying the integrated sustainabl e pricing model under three case scenarios as  mentioned below by their charging bases:         o Case scenario A: PAYT is not implemented.  o Case scenario B: PAYT is implemented but no waste r eduction occurs.  o Case scenario C: PAYT is implemented and waste redu ction occurs.    In the comparative analysis of the results, the inv estment cost  is the same in  all PAYT cases whether waste reduction has occurred  or not. By contrast, for all implementation  scenarios, the operational cost will be potentially  reduced by the monetary savings earned directly  due to revenues from marketing recyclables.    4.1 Case scenario A: PAYT is not implemented  Under the current MW collection and disposal system  in Egypt, residents indirectly pay a  ‘flat fee’ for the waste management service via the ir electricity bill, in addition to informal  charges. The fee mainly depends on the household ac tivities whichare either commercial or non- commercial. The fee ranges from L.E.10/month  per household to L.E.60/month   for shops and commercial activities. Unde r this case scenario, all household wastes  are not separated or sorted before collection and n o additional investment cost for the PAYT  Journal Pre-proof 18   program will be considered. The results indicate th at the total MW cost management under case  scenario A  is USD732.5  million from which $410 million is for organic food  waste . Total recycled  wastes  are approximately USD88 million while the rest  are USD644.5 million land  filled for 27 Egyptian municipal councils. The tota l flat fee revenue charged based on the number  of households  is around USD1 77.5 million/yr   for 27 Egyptian councils. This indicates the severe  gap  between cost (USD732.5  million) and collected fees  unde r case scenario A, where PAYT is not  implemented. That is, MW collection costs in 27 Egy ptian councils are much higher  than  collected fees under the no PAYT program.    4.2 Case scenario B: PAYT is implemented but no was te reduction occurs  By adopting a PAYT program, residents directly pay for the services of waste collection  based on the amount of wastes they throw away. The amount of waste is measured by two PAYT  accounting methods such as weight-based and volume- based. Table 6 below presents the  findings of these two PAYT accounting methods. When  PAYT is implemented even without any  waste reduction occurring , the pr ices for recyclables covers both variable and  fixed collection costs leading to cost savings per tonne which indicates a profit for the  governorate/council. Where a negative sign value oc curs, it means an extra cost per tonne should  be incurred by the governorate or per household to cover the total MW management cost.  Additional environmental and economic values from c omposting and energy generation are a  bonus as shown in Table 6 below, although extra cos ts have to be added to mitigate or reduce the  GHG emissions during composting and recycling activ ities and until final treatment or disposal.  After considering indirect environmental and econom ic values generated from MW collection  with source waste separation by households, the ove rall value for the total cost per tonne or per  household is profitable under both PAYT accounting methods.   More specifically, full costs per tonne under the w eight-based scheme are USD63.09  while under the volume-based scheme they are USD41. 49. It is notable that the net yield for  recyclables under the volume-based scheme is better  compared with the weight-based scheme  probably because the weight-based scheme is more la bour intensive. By implementing a volume- based scheme, each MW could generate 51%   profit per tonne above the full MW  Journal Pre-proof 19   management costs and 52%  benefit generat ed per household compared with only  25.7%  profit per tonne and 25.9%  benefit generated per household by  the weight-based scheme, respectively. Again, both profit per tonne for governorate/council and  benefit per household from composting, energy and G HG emission values are higher under the  volume-based scheme  than the weight-based scheme  .

In the analysis in  Journal Pre-proof 20   this study, an average of 35% potential reduction i s estimated in the amount of waste generated.  This reduction is expected to decrease total collec tion costs which in turn is expected to increase  profit and benefit share per tonne. 3  Table 7 below illustrates the paired analysis t-test  for councils per tonne under two PAYT  accounting methods , in addition to  recyclables, and environmental and social values un der case scenario B and C compared against  case scenario A . As fixed investment costs are the same  under case scenarios B and C, the outputs are mainl y affected by variable cost differences. In  case scenario B, average variable costs for weight- based and volume-based methods are  USD22.91 and USD12.76, respectively. Again, in case  scenario C, average variable costs for  weight-based and volume-based methods are USD23.14 and USD12.89, respectively. In both  cases for the average variable cost per tonne, the volume-based method is less costly than the  weight-based method. It is noted that the average v ariable cost per tonne under case scenario C is  slightly increased compared with case scenario B. S imilarly, while the values of recyclables are  much higher in case scenario C than case scenario B , the reverse is evident for the environmental  and social value. These are because transportation and maintenance costs are affected by  collection frequency , as well as by the qua ntity of waste collected.    The results from this study shown in Table 7 reveal  significant differences in the means  of MW collection cost per tonne in favour of the vo lume-base method ( t-value 11.00 with p- value <0.01 and t-value 10.96 with p-value <0.01) versus the weight-base method ( t-value 7.20  with p-value <0.01 and t-value 7.12 with p-value <0.01) under both case scenarios B and C  respectively, and against case scenario A .  Furthermore, the differences in the means are signi ficant under both case scenarios B and  C for recyclables, environmental and social values . However, Table 7 reveals that  recyclables are likely to be much higher in case sc enario C   compared with case scenario B . For environmental and social  values, the results indicate a limited advantage fo r case scenario B over case scenario C ( t-value  7.25 with p-value <0.01 and t-value 3.59 with p-value <0.01).                                                    3 To encourage households to separate waste at sourc e, incentives are usually extended to the solid was te  management sector to develop its infrastructure. In centives could be granted either by profit share or  by fee waiving.  Profit share is implemented by using partial tax ho liday or full tax holiday, where full or only a por tion of recyclable  waste profits and income will be exempted.  Fee wai ving is implemented by direct cancellation of colle ction fees for  recyclable waste is an example.

As fixed  investment costs are the same under case scenarios B and C, the outputs are mainly affected by  variable cost differences. Here, in case scenario B , average variable costs for weight-based and  volume-based methods are USD25.14 and USD14.00, res pectively. Again, in case scenario C,  average variable costs for weight-based and volume- based methods are USD16.55 and USD9.23,  respectively. In both cases for the average variabl e cost per household, the volume-based method  is less costly than the weight-based method in Tabl e 8, which is similar to Table 7. However,  notably unlike Table 7, in Table 8 the average vari able cost per household under case scenario C  is much lower as compared with case scenario B. Sim ilarly, as per Table 8 the recyclables value  and environmental and social value per household ar e much lower in case scenario C than  case  scenario B. These findings clearly document the sui tability of the integrated sustainable  framework for the volume-based PAYT pricing model u nder the FCA method   generating economic, environmental and social benef its. Therefore, the case scenario C under the  volume-based  ‘modified PAYT pric ing model’ presents the best cost- effective and resource recovery/saving scenario tha t supports sustainable development towards a  circular economy.   The results of the analysis in Table 8 indicate sig nificant differences in the means of MW  collection variable costs per household. They are s imilar under both case scenarios B and C ( t≈5 21.05 21.05 63.09 84.95  41.49 63.14 84.91 109.41  61.46  51.69  020 40 60 80 100 120  Case scenario B Case scenario C Case scenario A Weight -base –Full cost Volume -base –Full cost  Recyclables value Enviro.& social value  Journal Pre-proof 23   with p-value <0.01) as well as having an inverse relation ship with costs per household in case  scenario A, under both PAYT accounting methods  (see  Figure 7). However, in the same context, the differ ences in the means of MW collection full  costs per household are insignificant. Additionally , the differences in the means of recyclables  are significant under both case scenarios B and C w ith the same t-value , whereas  environmental and social values are significantly h igher under case scenario B ( t-value 5.47 with  p-value <0.01) compared with case scenario C, which reported a relatively insignificant small t- value  probably due to the reduction in total  MW collection amounts under case scenario  C.

Discussion and Conclusions  Countries considering adopting the circular economy approach and PAYT need to  determine whether the charge for MW services will b e based on volume-based or weight-based  of the waste collected. Both weight-based and volum e-based methods are very different in design  and equipment requirements. In a volume-based progr am, residents are charged for waste  collection based on the number of bags or cans they  use, indicating size of waste containers. On  the other hand, in a weight-based program, waste is  weighed at the curb where collection crews  measure the amount of waste residents set out for c ollection and they are billed for collection and  disposal accordingly. Although most countries use v olume-based systems which are significantly  less expensive to set up, operate and manage than w eight-based systems, to administer the MW  service as part of their transition to the circular  economy, Egypt neither adopts the circular 34.93 34.93  25.14  14  -9.8  -20.94 16.55  9.23  -18.39 -25.71 -30 -20 -10 010 20 30 40  Weight-base-method Volume-base-method Case scenario A  Case scenario B:  average cost  Case scenario B:  average difference  Case scenario C:  average cost  Case scenario C:  average difference  34.93 34.93 70.72  62.13 59.58 54.81 92.7  77.64  67.1  56.43  020 40 60 80 100  Case scenario B Case scenario C Case scenario A Weight- base – Full cost Volume-base– Full cost  Recyclables value Enviro.& social value  Journal Pre-proof 25   economy approach nor the volume-based or weight-bas ed system in MW collection programs.  The current method of waste management in council i n Egypt is a ‘flat rate’ on collection and  disposal of waste for all residents irrespective of  the volume or weight of waste as described in  Section 4 under case scenario A: ‘is not implemente d.’ Unlike the PAYT volume-based or  weight-based system, this flat rate system is much more costly without having any sustainable  benefits in terms of social and environmental aspec ts in order to support the transition towards  the circular economy. Therefore, in this paper, Egy pt has been taken as a case study where the  application of an effective PAYT accounting approac h for pricing MW collection systems has  not yet been developed.    Building on prior literature and practical experien ce gained from other countries, the  integrated PAYT model proposed in this study under a volume-based system aims to achieve  cost efficiency and financial benefits for both mun icipal councils and households. Therefore, in  this study 27 council waste management costs, benef its and the resulting municipal charges are  considered by using FCA for the two different PAYT methods (i.e. weight-based and volume- based) under three case scenarios for implementatio n. The integrated PAYT framework is to  support policy makers and waste managers in the ado ption of PAYT schemes. Based on the  experiences documented in other countries, both a f ixed and a variable fee in Egyptian municipal  councils are adopted in this study rather than a ‘f lat rate’ only, depending on the amount of waste  generated. This is because, on the one hand, waste collection fees charged should reflect the cost  structure of waste disposal which includes both fix ed and variable costs while, on the other hand,  levying fees on collected waste quantities may only  increase illegal disposal activity. Therefore,  the fixed fee inclusion in the service fee will hel p to mitigate such practices. Furthermore, in  order to incentivize more collection of separated w aste at source, fees on the collection of  residual organic food waste could be used to fund s ource separation activities. Therefore, fees are  set only on residual organic food waste and providi ng the service of collection for recyclables  without charges, or they may go further by buying s eparated recyclables from the user.  Comparative analysis in this study identifies the d ifferences in unit costs of the waste  collection and the best method in financial terms f or both households and the municipal councils.  The results reveal that both PAYT methods  will reduce the  cost incurred by the councils and for households, i f anticipated waste reduction occurs (i.e. case  scenario C). The variable cost  for the volume- Journal Pre-proof 26   based method  will be decreased  by an average of 39% per tonne in all  cases compared with weight-based methods which is s lightly increased by 9.5% per tonne. This  is because weight-based methods require more labour  to do the weighing process. However, the  variable costs per household under both case scenar io B and case scenario C  are  lower than case scenario A . If a fam ily is willing to achieve waste reduction  , the percentage of variable  cost reduction for the household will be  higher for the volume-based method  against th e weight-based method . Therefore,  the volume-based bag method creates more incentives  for households because it has the lower  variable charge ) and, after reduction efforts,  the variable waste charges may decrease by 34% (USD 9.23/bag/year - case scenario C (volume- based)). The prepaid garbage bag scheme leads to th e lowest waste charges for both case  scenario B and case scenario C. Thus, the highly su ggested method to be implemented in Egypt  is based on a prepaid garbage bag system under the volume-based modified PAYT method  . This can generate a cost-e ffective scheme. The weight-based method is  less applied in practice, as it is more labour inte nsive, and complicated to design and manage.   Again, there are incentives for the municipal counc ils to implement PAYT for  environmental, social, sustainability and economic savings from recyclables. However,  successful implementation of PAYT needs to establis h a continuous promotional campaign  taking effective actions versus illegal diversions while creating adequate and enduring incentives  for households which is essential. It is noted that  generally the total amount of recyclables and  the quality of supplied secondary materials are aff ected by the level of source separation for  MW. For example, recovering recyclables from mixed waste tends to reduce its marketing  possibilities because of its possible contamination . Conversely, separate collection of separated  MW from households at source can lead to increases in the costs of the waste collection process.  On the other hand, as illustrated in Figure 9 below , source separation for MW results in  profitability for both councils and households. Fur ther, it creates significant economic,  environmental and social benefits for industry, ene rgy and food security if it is managed properly  with reasonable implementation of the integrated su stainable PAYT cost accounting approach. It  is suggested that for evaluating the impact, a revi ew must be conducted after an adequate  implementation period for the charging method in te rms of economic, environmental and social  performances. For economic performance, it is impor tant to ensure that the full cost of the  Journal Pre-proof 27   overall MW management service including the value o f recyclables is covered. While  environmental performance could be evaluated, for e xample by the reduction in GHG rates due  to incremental flows of recycled waste, the assessm ent of social benefits could be made by  reductions or exemptions for low income citizens.  Thus, this study has a strong public benefit compon ent to reach the best MW  management that result in the lowest cost with the highest circular economy benefits in an  emerging economy context. There are increasing dema nds from councils, communities and  businesses to adopt low cost MW management systems that extend sustainable benefits (i.e.  environmental, social and economic) to all stakehol ders and the society. While developed  countries are at the forefront in this space, emerg ing and developing countries are still catching  up. This study sheds some light on an emerging mark et’s MW recyclable management cost  accounting approach  for achieving cost  efficiency and contributing to broader environmenta l, climate and social issues. These findings  have various implications for the policy makers, go vernment councils, waste managers,  businesses and communities in the adoption of PAYT schemes for cost-effective, profitable and  socially acceptable reusing and recycling of waste that can contribute to environmental and  social sustainability. These outcomes can be genera lised to other emerging economies for  achieving their sustainable development and cost ef ficiency.   However, this study is not free from limitations. F irst and foremost, the data sample (27  municipal councils) might not be considered large e nough for the cross-section study. Also, a  circular economy takes all sectors and industries i nto account, though only a few industries are  selected in Egypt as the core of circular economy. Second, a country specific context may be an  issue e.g. Egypt in MENA. Each country, either deve loped or emerging, has its distinct  institutional and socio-cultural settings. For exam ple, the findings or experience in one country  may not be exactly the same as in other countries o r regions. Third, in terms of the methods  applied, the study is a scenario-based case study o n two alternative PAYT pricing models from a  circular economy context. These limitations of the current study can be overcome by future  research. It is expected that future research may u ndertake further in-depth analysis on a larger  sample size, industry sectors and data periods. Fut ure research studies should consider capturing  other emerging countries for a comparative analysis  among emerging economies by controlling  their institutional, regulatory and socio-economic features. Future research potential also lies in  Journal Pre-proof 28   the application of other empirical and qualitative methods to review a comprehensive circular  economy approach. This approach fosters innovation and new business models for economic,  social and environmental benefits. It is important to explore a better understanding of the  sustainability and circular economy relationship in  a greater depth from the viewpoint of  municipal waste management and the impact on busine sses, customers and society as a whole.
