circular ie close material cycles decisionmakers need detailed data about the production and treatment of waste at city level conventional statistics on waste are oftenincomplete or lack detail waste inputoutput accounting offers an alternative using waste supply and use tables to create detailed inventories of economywide ows of waste in this study we develop such tables for the cityregion of brussels belgium and use them to analyse the urban waste metabolism interms of waste ows waste production intensity and waste treatment performance the waste ow analysis revealed the amount of collected waste the proportion contributed by indi vidual sectors the material composition of waste ows and the location of treatment currently around of the million tons of waste collected in brussels is treated in local facilities however less than of the collected waste is used in a way that closes material cycles within city limits the waste per formance analysis reveals that the construction sector had the highest waste production intensity and the household sector the highest incineration intensity in terms of waste prevention and local valorisation potential we identied ows and sectors for future targeting one of the most promising being food waste we conclude that the urban context can restrict the local valorisation of waste ows thus we see the role of cities such as brussels in a circular economy as mainly contributing to the closing of materialcycles at national or even global level c published by elsevier ltd introduction waste ows and the circular economy the global amounts of waste generated are estimated between and billion tons per year wilson et al the amount of solid waste recorded in ofcial statistics is around billion tons it is estimated that from this amount is landlled recycled and incinerated tisserant et al thus almost of waste is currently not reused or recycled this represents an enormous loss of resources and explains the high pressure on global primary resources however not only the depletion of resources constitutes an environmental as well as socioeconomic chal lenge but also the impacts from the treatment of the waste repre sent negative externalities first of all environmental impacts from uncontrolled disposal of waste into the environment for example accumulation of micro plastics in the oceans threateningthe marine fauna avio et al but also environmental impacts from controlled waste treatment processes create environ mental problems for example methane from landlls that consti tute around of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions ackerman or the emissions of air pollutants from waste incineration lu et al in order to reduce environmental pressure from waste resource and waste management principles have been introduced into waste legislation the most important principle implemented in the european waste legislation is the waste hierarchy establishing a priority order from prevention preparation for reuse recycling and energy recovery to disposal activities such as landlling ec the waste hierarchy is a generalised and widely accepted environmental ranking where prevention is considered to be the most environmentfriendly and landll the least environment friendly alternative however results from life cycle assessments lca have shown that such generalization is problematic and that environmental performances show strong dependency on local specicities of the waste management systems laurent et al also article of the waste framework directive ec allows deviations from the waste hierarchy where this is justied by lca results  x c published by elsevier ltdcorresponding authors email addresses vzellerulbacbe v zeller wouterachtenulbacbe wmj achtenwaste management contents lists available at sciencedirect waste management journal homepage wwwelse viercomloc atewasman currently the socalled circular economy ce concepts are pro moted to achieve more waste prevention and better resource man agement by extending and closing material cycles ce concepts are promoted at european level through the circular economy pack age adopted by the ec in including legislative proposals and other initiatives ec important actions are the tar gets for recycling for municipal solid waste msw for construction and demolition cd waste for packaging waste landll restrictions msw reduction to promotion of industrial symbiosis and ecodesign even if waste prevention at source has highest priority quantitative waste prevention tar gets except for food waste are still lacking in european legislation circular economy at city scale due to the dynamic population and economic development in cities the environmental pressure in terms of resource consump tion and waste generation is especially high in cities hoornweg et al to improve local performances many cities turning towards ce concepts for example organised in the circular cities network a current review of ce initiatives around the globe iden tied cities that promote ce but with different targets and interests petitboix and leipold proximity of resources and people a sufcient scale for effective markets supplyand demand and the ability to shape urban plan ning and policy are seen as factors for the unique position of cities in ce the geographic proximity of supply and demand is expected to have environmental benets through more efcient material collec tion cycles and more efcient reverse logistic ellen macarthur foundation this proximity advantage is also frequently men tioned in the context of urban symbiosis which is based on the syn ergistic opportunity arising from the geographic proximity of urban waste sources and potential industrial users through exchange of waste materials for environmental benet van berkel et al although environmental benets are mentioned in the context of urban ce few environmental assessments of urban initiatives are available and complementary cerelated environmental research is rarely applied at city level petitboix and leipold however some environmental assessments of ce develop ments at city level are available for asian cities for example fang et al found resources and carbon footprint savings in one of chinas national pilot cities for ce sun et al found life cycle environmental benets of urban symbiosis within a typ ical industrial city in china and geng et al found co reduc tions for urban symbiosis scenarios in kawasaki japan comparative environmental assessments of ce activities between the city and larger scales are less frequent wang et al evaluated the performance of cities in china based on an index system for ce developments considering mainly environ mental criteria and found higher growth of ce in the pilot cities than in the rest of the country other comparative analyses are car ried out for specic ce initiatives within cities for example for urban agriculture comparisons of urban and conventional agricul tural systems have shown environmental benets for certain types of urban agricultural systems goldstein et al however these studies did not systematically investigate the use of urban biowaste the case studies investigated by sanymengual et al found a reduction of embodied greenhouse gases from reduced transport packaging and food distribution losseshowever the question about the impact of the geographical scale is not only an environmental one it is also highly relevant for technoeconomic feasibility of ce initiatives sterr and ott state that the right size is the minimal size in which outputs can be retransformed into desired inputs thereby adequately closing material loops in their case study in an industrial region any kind of material could be recycled within the regional boundaries except of metals however the size of the market needs to be suf ciently large critical mass to sustain specialized industries and to provide economically viable ce solutions chen et al found that the size of recycling boundaries depends on the type of waste for example waste oil metal plas tics paper and waste electrical and electronic equipment weee are circulated in large regions large recycling boundaries whereas organic wastes mixed msw and demolition wastes aresuitable for local recycling and recovery according to the analysis ofchen et al the determinants of recycling boundaries are the density of separated waste and the unit transportationtreat ment cost waste with high market value accumulated at low den sity and low unit cost of transportationtreatment such as metal and glass are typically recycled at large scale waste with low mar ket value accumulated at high density and high unit cost and trans portationtreatment residual msw food waste and bulky waste are more suited for local recycling however the appropriate size of scale must be determined based on specic local conditions waste and ce strategy in brussels since brussels has a regional program for a circular econ omy prec that includes a set of transversal sectorial terri torial and governance measures to support the citys ce transition the dematerialisation of the economy implementation of extended product cycles and the reduction of environmental impacts are dened as nal environmental targets of the plan however the local economic stimulation ie the creation of local jobs and local value chains are the central criteria of the program the sectorial measures target priority sectors like construction resource waste logistics transport commerce and food for the resource waste sector repair and reuse are identied as core actions of local ce the ce program is closely interlinked with brussels waste plan the current th waste plan bruxelles environnement includes a waste prevention program targets for separate collec tion and targets for the recycling of msw and cd waste it also contains quantitative waste prevention targets for food paper packaging diapers garden waste and other waste categories from households and economic sectors in a legal obligation became effective to separately collect the recyclable fractions ofhousehold waste in the legal obligation was extended to eco nomic activities currently the th waste plan is under develop ment which focusses on ce and a zero waste strategy region de bruxellescapitale despite the legal framework and dedicated programs the mon itoring report about msw management in belgium shows a low overall recycling rate for brussels gentil also more recent datasets eurostat a show an overall msw recycling rate of around for brussels while the average belgian performance was in in gentil the low performance is explained by the lack of infrastructure for the treatment of organic waste and lack of collectionrecycling infrastructure related to the high urban density the citys waste plan bruxelles environnement states a number of constraints and challenges for the local waste manage ment sector such as the high population density persons per kmeurostat b the small territory only km and the highly urbanized terrain residential and service sector land usethe sufcient market scale for wasteresources at city level is also discussed in the context of urban mining urban mining involves the systematic recovery orextraction of materials from urban areas where large stocks of materials are found inparticular in buildings and infrastructure endoflife products packaging materialand biomass li v zeller et al waste management of eurostat these conditions limit the availability of sites and the infrastructure network necessary to build new sorting or recycling facilities the fact that most people live in multi apartment buildings and have no access to a private garden share of apartments of the houses bruxelles environnement is considered as a constraint for an efcient waste separation and storage the citys economy is characterised by a high share of service and public sector of gross value added eurostat c and by a small company size since most companies are integrated in the urban network it is difcult to monitor the waste produced by these companies data availability accounting frameworks and analytical methods in order to study the development of innovative waste manage ment options and implementation of ce models detailed informa tion on current and future waste ows is needed this requires the availability of i detailed waste statistical data on the amount of waste generated collected and treated ii accounting frameworks to link waste with other relevant ows productionconsumption in a coherent manner and iii analytical tools to assess performances regarding data availability hage and sderholm state that waste management analyses should rely on local data but that data availability at cityregion level is often problematic also prendeville et al identied a lack of access to data as a key barrier to the implementation of initiatives in cities more speci cally the availability of waste statistical data at the local and regional scale is challenging in terms of data coverage households and economic activities detail waste composition spatialsector resolution and temporal completeness availability of time series regarding the availability of accounting frameworks that link waste with production and consumption data methodological pro gress has been achieved in the last years and an international stan dard the system of environmental economic accounts seea has been developed economywide material ow accountings ewmfa which are published by most european countries since are part of this framework these datasets have improved the data availability on physical material ows but data is highly aggregated and reported at country scale only for brussels a metabolism study is available that has used the ewmfa frame work athanassiadis et al the solid material inputs addi tion to the net stock and the output ows exports were quantied and complemented by an energy and water balance reference year more detailed datasets in terms of sector resolution are inputoutput io frameworks which are also part of the seea in conventional io frameworks product and service ows betweeneconomic sectors and towards the nal demand sectors are mea sured in monetary terms waste treatment services are accounted but ows of waste without positive monetary value are not avail able in order to account for waste ows and to assess impacts of waste treatment processes nakamura and kondo developed the waste inputoutput model wio model it is a conceptual framework to include physical waste ows into the monetary ioframework the wio model was further developed into several directions i towards a model where also the product ows are accounted in physical units nakamura et al ii towards a model where waste ows are integrated into a monetary supply and use model lenzen and reynolds and towards an multiregional monetary supply and use model fry et al although the theoretical foundation of wio models and the development towards material ows accountings have been intro duced since more than years to date only few databases are available that provide complementary physical and monetary data an exception is the exiobase database a global multiregionalenvironmentally extended io database available in a monetary and physical hybrid version tukker et al wood et al at the subnational level for example the citylevel such detailed iodatasets but even the aggregated ewmfa are hardly available to analyse product and waste ows at the scale of an economy material ow analysis mfa and inputoutput analysis ioa are used as analytical methods material flow analysis is a systematic assessment of the ows and stocks of materials within a system dened in space and time brunner and rechberger the basic principle of mfa is the mass balance stating that the inputs into a system must equal the outputs ie law of conservation of matterenergy regarding its original area of application brunner and rechberger specify i the metabolism of cities and ii the analysis of pollutantpathways guibrunet et al dene urban metabolism as framework that takes material ows as the unit of analysis to describe patterns of natural resources transformation in cities the urban metabolism gives a holistic view on all activities in a city including all inputs stocks and outputs of materials and energy while the standard urban metabolism study represents an analysis of the status quo at a certain time point recently the framework of dynamic urban metabolism has been developed athanassiadis et al the urban metabolism aims to give a general picture of ows one of the output ows being waste ows the waste metabolism is a type of analysis that studies specically the ows of waste from generation to treatment dalisa et al suggest the use of new indicators to describe the waste metabolism the meta bolic rate of waste and the density of waste the waste metabolic rate indicates the pace of waste generated or disposed per hour of human activity the density of waste indicates the amount of waste generated separately collected or disposed per day in a given area browne et al suggest to use the materials meta bolic inefciency indicator which relates the nal disposal of mate rial and product wastes to consumption in order to determine sectoral inefciency the use of new waste performance indicators and the graphical representation of waste ows as metabolic net work composed of ows and functional nodes treatment facilities are the main characteristics of the waste metabolic analysis con ducted by chifari et al environmentally extended inputoutput analysis eeioa is an analytical method to calculate direct and indirect economic and environmental impacts induced by nal consumption when inputoutput analyses ioa are applied to waste inputoutput models the generation and treatment of physical waste ows can be calculated recent examples of such studies called waste footprints include the analysis of solid waste generation and treatment at global level tisserant et al cumulative waste pro duction induced by australian consumers fry et al o r waste induced by consumption of tokyo residents tsukui et al waste performance indicators that can be derived from waste ioa are the multipliers from the direct and total require ment matrices that determine the waste production and treatment intensity of sectors fry et al for example use the waste production multipliers t millions to compare the sectoral waste production intensity and found signicant differences between two domestic regions objective and scope of the study the aim of this research is to analyse the current state of brus sels waste management system and to identify its waste preven tion and ce valorisation potential the scope of the study includes all kind of nonhazardous solid waste collected from households and economic activities we develop waste supply v zeller et al waste management and use tables for brussels and use this framework it to analyse the citys waste metabolism because it provides an economywide scope while maintaining the high sector detail that is required for an analysis of waste performance and valorisation potential section presents the data and method used to construct waste supply and use tables at the city level section presents results from the waste metabolic analysis including the waste ow tables and a sankey diagram as well as waste performance indicators we also discuss the outcomes in terms of ce valorisation potential section presents the conclusions that can be drawn from the dif ferent analyses data and methods in this study we use the wio framework to perform the anal ysis of waste ow and waste performance the various waste tables that are part of the accounting framework offer different perspectives on the ows of waste a wastetype sector and treatmentspecic perspective the rst step of our approach was to complete data and to estimate the total amount of col lected waste section this completed dataset fed into the second step the construction of the detailed waste supply and use tables in step we developed the waste treatment allocation table for brussels followed by the construction of the waste supply to treatment table in the last step we aggre gated data from the different tables to visualise them in a sankey diagram the waste performance indicators selected in this study are presented in data collection and treatment waste statistical data due to its status as cityregion statistical data on msw is avail able msw which represents around of the total waste includes household and similar commercial industrial and institu tional waste collected by or on behalf of municipal authorities thus the fractions not similar to household waste cd waste metal scraps vehicles etc or the waste collected by private oper ators eg bulky or weee are not included for these waste frac tions only estimations of the waste amounts exist presented in highly aggregated waste categories for example waste from com panies and administration other waste in order to improve the initial data situation and to determine the total amount of solid nonhazardous waste collected in brus sels we collected data from the three entities involved in the waste management or in the monitoring of waste data the regionalagency bruxellespropret who is the main collector of msw bruxelles environnement the environmental administration of brussels in charge of the waste register monitoring all waste types that need to be registered and the statistical ofce recydata that monitors waste ows collected by private collectors recydata the collected datasets were analysed and then combined into a joint database towa et al it contains detailed data on solid nonhazardous waste collected in and and is available in two formats the rst one represents the waste collection system operating in brussels where waste data is measured in for example tons of mixed residual waste col lected in white bagscontainer the second format is wastetype specic and represents materials such as glass inert metals etc this wastetype specic dataset was calculated from the original data by applying waste composition ratios from composition anal yses agence bruxelles proprt abp recydata table presents the amounts of waste in the wastetype specic format inputoutput tables for belgium interregional supply and use tables as well as inputoutput tables are available which model the economic ows of products between brussels the two other belgian regions ie the walloon and flemish region europe and noneurope the original interregional model available from the belgian statistical authorities bfp et al was developed by disaggregating the national inputoutput system by means of topdown methods and consistent with the regional accounts the regional supply tables specify the monetary output for each economic sector in the three belgian regions the model was extended by environ mental data and coupled with exiobase for the import ows zeller in the extended model brussels economy is struc tured into sectors plus households that produce and consume types of products and services this economic inputoutputframework that follows the sector classication listed in the sup plementary material supplement builds the general structure for the developed waste extensions and waste supply and use tables this section describes the construction of the waste supply and use tables in our accounting based on waste statistical data waste is dened in a narrow sense without byproducts or recovered products or materials table shows the layout of the waste supply table ws for brussels it is a waste type by economic activity table whose components wskjand wskfshow the amount of waste type kin ton generated by an economic activity jor by the nal

from table over economic activities and households based on a waste type specic allocation key to derive this key we calculated sector specic waste intensities from the belgian dataset in exiobase v ntnu et al and scaled them to the economic output of each sector that is given in brussels supply data bfp et al the results ie the estimated amounts per type of waste and per sector are then expressed as percentage contributions to the total waste gen eration for a specic type of waste for example the allocation key for food waste allocates of the food waste from economic activities to

treatment sectors or the use of waste wukfin an exterior waste treatment sector ie waste export compared to other authors nakamura and kondo we account the use of waste only in a waste treatment activity not in another sector this difference is closely linked to the denition of waste given above when byproducts and recov ered materials are not included only the conventional waste treat ment sectors use waste as an input the total amount of waste treated wukis given by wukx jwukjwukf the waste treatment sector in brussels consists of the material recovery incineration and composting sector other possible waste treatment sectors eg anaerobic digestion or landll do not exist in brussels and are therefore not mentioned as economic activitiesintable the material recovery sector is a heterogeneous sector grouping i dismantling activities and ii mechanical or chemical transformation processes also including separating and sorting of recoverable materials code in nace rev the sector is called preparation for material recovery in the following in order to emphasize that the activities carried out in brussels are mainly separation sorting and dismantling activities in order to determine the inputoutput ows of this sector we collected physical and economic data from companies assigned to this sector the total amounts of waste incinerated and compostedare published in annual reports bruxelles propret the material composition of waste incinerated was derived from waste bagscontainer composition analyses agence bruxelles proprt abp recydata the amount of exported waste was calculated by subtracting the amounts of waste treated in brussels from the total amounts of waste collected thus in the waste use table the export column is a balancing item and repre sents the

higher waste treatment allocation table ws and wu determine the amounts of waste collected and the total amounts of waste used in the waste treatment sectors they do not determine how a certain waste type produced by a certain sector is treated in order to make this correspondence between generation and treatment at sector level an additional table is needed that determines waste treatment rates

combined with other data sourcesfrom monitoring studies and direct contacts with waste collectors and wastetreatment facilities to identify and solve declarations errors and eliminate doublecounting towa et al v zeller et al waste management in order to visualise local material cycles we also added to the diagram the ows of the secondary waste from incineration ie bottom ash y ash metal residues etc and ows of secondary raw materials recovered materials like sorted pet produced in brussels the numerical tables behind the sankey are given in sup plement waste performance indicators to measure and compare the waste performance of the citys sectors the two indicators waste production intensity and waste treatment intensity are chosen because they measure two impor tant aspects of a sectors performance the sectors waste inef ciency in terms of amount of waste and type of treatment the waste production intensity reects the sectors production inef ciency and is expressed as a ratio between waste and production it is calculated by dividing each component of the waste supply table wskjsee by the economic activity output xjfrom brussels supply table the waste intensity is measured in ton per m sector output in order to take into account not only the amounts of generated waste but also the type of treatment the waste treatment inten sity is used as second indicator it refers to the amount of wasteproduced by a sector in ton that is sent to a specic treatment for example to incineration or recycling it is calculated by divid ing each component of the supply to treatment table ws t ij by the economic activity output xjfrom brussels supply table the waste treatment intensity is also measured in ton per m sec tor output since the economic sector output is only available for the waste coefcients are calculated for results and discussion waste ow analysis waste supply and use tables the results of the waste supply table for brussels are shown in table the ten waste types are broad categories containing differ ent product types produced by households and economic activi ties for example glass includes at glass from end of life vehicles and from cd activities but also packaging glass disposed by households and the hotels and restaurant sector the category inert contains concrete bricks tiles and ceramics inert mixture asphalt soil and stones the category other is a mixed fraction consisting mostly of complex packaging ne particles or street cleaning residues the total amount of waste collected in is around mil lion tons from which is generated by economic activities and by households table shows that households are the most important contributor for glass food textile and garden waste while inert metal and paper and cardboard are mainly produced by economic activities the sectorspecic results are too detailed to be reproduced here but available in the supplementary material supplement the results show that only for inert waste a large share of inert waste can be aligned to one particular sector the con struction sector for the other waste types the amounts are more widely distributed over economic activities for example for paper waste the public administration nancial intermediation and the other business services have a share of and respec tively and the remaining part is distributed over economic activities when discussing the quality of this detailed sector repartition we point to the following sources of uncertainties first for certain sectors the local economic output specied in the supply table could be higher than their real production so called head quarter problem and second the national waste intensity could under or overestimate the regional waste intensity previous comparison between estimations based on waste coefcient approach and sta tistical data zeller et al have shown that uncertainties occur mainly for metals glass and inert waste table shows the amount of waste used in the local waste treatment facilities ie input capacities and the amount of waste exported to waste treatment facilities located out of brussels around kt of waste of the total is treated in brussels the remaining is directly exported regarding the data quality it has to be mentioned that the totals for incineration and compost ing represent accurate numbers measured by the treatment facili ties while the quantity for the preparation for material recoverysector and the detailed wastetype specic inputs represents esti mations obtained from the sources previously described agence bruxelles proprt abp bruxelles propret recydata table is the waste supply to treatment table that shows treatment and sectorspecic results most waste collected from households is used in the local treatment facilities while waste col lected from economic activities is mainly exported the treatment options export to incineration unknown landll and compost occur for waste from economic activities only these variations in treatment between economic activities and the household sector result from the different collection schemes and actors publicpri vate responsible for the collection of waste when comparing the amount of waste sent to the local preparation of material recovery sector and to the local incinerator indicated in table with the corresponding data from table we nd that the calculated amounts in table are slightly lower than the ones measured in the use tables this indicates that incineration rates and materialtable waste supply to treatment table hh households ea economic activity v zeller et al waste

analysis sankey diagram to represent waste ows in a sankey diagram we used aggre gated versions of table andtable on the left of the dia gram fig the origin of waste is shown represented by sector groups the size of each sector box represents the contribution of each sector to the total amount of waste collected in brussels we observe that households and construction are the most impor tant contributing sectors to the total waste ow representing and respectively the composition of each sectors waste ow is represented by several single ow arrows leaving the sector box we can see that the collected waste from households is heteroge neously composed in contrast to the waste from the construction sector that is dominated by inert waste the single waste ows end in a waste treatment activity which might be located within or outside of brussels the sum ow arrows indicate the contribution of each waste treatment activity to the overall waste management system of the total collected

also included the secondary waste ow from incineration indicating the proportion that is landlled or sent to recycling the diagonalshaded ows in fig show secondary raw mate rials or products recovered from the intermediate treatment pro cesses these materials and products are mostly exported to recycling facilities in belgium europe or the rest of the world with only a small amount being reused at city level kt of compost from kt of garden waste sold to users in brussels ktof textiles kt of wood kt of plastics and kt of metals this means that less than of the total collected waste is used in a way that closes material cycles at city level in addition to these local material cycles the incineration plant with energy recovery could be considered as a local energy cycle around of brussels households can be supplied with electricity from the incinerator this energy ow is not represented in this massrelated sankey diagram the sum ow arrows for waste and secondary raw material on the right of the diagram show the current state of waste treatment in terms of the quantity dealt with by each treatment mode and whether this occurs within or outside the city nonetheless as pre viously mentioned the data and therefore by denition the anal ysis has certain limitations it is based on the quantities of collected waste and does not take account of products being reused before collection for example this is why we see textile reuse in the form of clothes collected in containers and afterwards partly reused but not clothes sold secondhand likewise the data does not account for products that are resold on markets sold between individuals or that are donated due to the variety ofproducts and reuse exchange possibilities this part of the ce which is already in place could not be quantied and is not represented in the diagram furthermore since the diagram aims to present the origin and nal destination of waste ows intermediate collection points or ows between the waste treatment facilities are not illustrated for example sorting residues from the pmd and paper sorting facility that are sent to incineration are not illustrated as a separate ow between sorting facility and incinerator but included in the input ows to the incineration plant in reality registered actors participate in waste collection and treatment in brussels and various interactions occur between actors waste performance analysis in this section we analyse the waste performance of the citys sectors based on two indicators the waste production and the waste treatment intensity table shows the waste production intensity measured in tonm for the aggregated sectors see since the primary sec tor has almost no practical relevance for brussels we can exclude it from the discussion the results show that the service sectors have a lower waste production intensity between tonm to tonm compared to the other sectors up to tonm the waste intensity of the manufacturing sector is slightly lower tonm than the transport and communication sector this indicates that brussels manufacturing sector has few production intensive industries the household sector has the second highest waste production intensity the highest intensity occurs for the construction sector due to its high share of heavy inert waste when comparing sectors by waste type we nd highest inten sity for glass waste in the horeca sector for inert metals and wood waste the waste production intensity is highest in the construction comp composting inc inci neration ad anaerobic digestion fig sankey diagram of waste and secondary raw material ows brussels comp composting inc incineration ad anaerobic digestion the low landll rate is a general pattern in belgium where around of the total waste was landlled in eurostat d an estimation of the second hand market in uk has shown amounts of around kt of products sold on car boot and furniture reuse markets gregson et al which represents compared to the annually nonhazardous waste generated v zeller et al waste management sector for food paper and plastic waste in the household sector and for textile waste in the sector other nonsales services table shows the waste treatment intensity measured in tonm for the aggregated sectors again we can ignore the results for the primary sector the treatment intensity results from the specic mix of waste produced by a sector and the wastetype specic treatment rates households show the highest intensity of incineration but also second highest intensity of local material recovery the construction sector has highest local material recov ery rates ie preparation for material recovery the regional material recovery consists mainly of sorting and crushing activities of the inert fraction the produced recycled aggregates are used in various applications for instance for road base and lling materials in road construction downcycling the two presented indicators show the direct waste intensity ie the amount of waste produced directly by an economic activity or households without including waste generated upstream in the supply chain as a result of products supplied to the sector the direct waste production intensity has been analysed by various authors but the comparison of values is difcult due to differences in sector classication and monetary reference values for exam ple reynolds et al found highest waste intensity for the construction sector but in the aggregated results it is classied as a service sector so that service sectors have highest direct waste intensities high direct waste intensities for the primary construc tion and transport and communication sectors were also found by reynolds et al and nakamura et al regarding the waste treatment intensity comparisons with other studies reveal strong differences due to different waste treatment schemesestablished in the respective region under study for example the comparison between countries in tisserant et al reveals that recycling is the dominant treatment method in many european countries while it is landll in for example brazil mexico or russia and incineration in japan circular economy valorisation and waste prevention potential the results from waste supply and use tables and the associated sankey diagram were used to identify the nonexploited valorisa tion potential of brussels waste ows this is important informa tion for decisionmakers implementing ce models regarding the ranking of treatmentvalorisation options we rely on the gener alised environmental ranking of the waste hierarchy see since waste prevention at source is the highest priority in the euro pean and regional waste plans we also interpreted the results in terms of their waste prevention potential when using fig to identify potential waste prevention options the sector contribution and waste composition analysis can provide useful information the household sector was identi ed as the most important single contributor at and sector with second highest waste production intensity the household sector is also the main focus of the current prevention strategy in brussels waste plan however when considering the total waste ow for the city the importance of the remaining sectors eco nomic activities becomes evident especially the construction sector that is the second highest single contributor at and the sector with highest waste production intensity the adminis tration and education sector third highest contributor at istable waste production intensity in tonm glass inert metals food paper plastic

important target sector for prevention measures however waste production intensity is lower than for example the one from households the current waste plan provides quantitative preven tion targets for food paper and plastic but when comparing these priorities with the composition of the waste ows we note that the biggest ow in terms of mass is missing the inert waste ow thus it is clear that prevention policies need to be extended to all waste types and need to target economic activities as well when analysing the sankey to identify new ce valorisation options with the priority on material recovery as suggested by the waste hierarchy we focus on the waste treatment options that do not yet close material cycles at local or global level when applying this focus we identify the possibility to redirect waste ows from the incinerator towards material reuse or recycling as measure with highest potential for brussels the reduction ofwaste ows going to the incinerator implies to increase the sorting efciency at source but also to expand the options of separate sort ing in this context one stream is of particular importance due to its size and current treatment the ow of food waste that is cur rently incinerated separate collection of this stream and valorisa tion in composting or anaerobic digestion could contribute to the closing of material cycles when discussing the options for the local ce valorisation poten tial which is the focus adopted by the regional ce plan it is helpful to distinguish between i preparation for material recovery ii and material recoveryreprocessing the existing local facilities and actors active in the collection and sorting of textiles bulky waste dismantling of weee or separation of plastic paper and metals belong to the rst type of valorisation the extension of such activities would imply to increase the amount of products with reuse or recycling potential for example by improving access to collection points by improving separation at source and exten sion of collections that maintain product quality furthermore the local sortingdismantling infrastructure could be extended for example by an additional sorting line for plastics that are not sep arated and recycled today bulky waste sorting or weee dismantling however the implementation of the second type of valorisation can be limited at city scale by technoeconomic constraints as dis cussed in only specic waste types such as organic wastes mixed msw and demolition wastes are considered to be suitable for local material recycling and energy recovery thus setting again the priority on the unexploited potential for material recov ery the highest ce valorisation potential occurs for organic waste by extending the existing composting capacity to invest in anaer obic digestion or in a combination of both the export of waste to composting anaerobic digestion and incineration facilities outside of brussels should be avoided if local valorisation is priority however potential changes in the waste management system need to be further assessed based on lcas that consider not only the potential benets of avoided transport but also the efciency of the complete waste treatment chain conclusions and outlook by using the waste inputoutput framework we were able to close data gaps and to increase the level of detail in the waste data this could contribute in empirically identifying the waste ows with the most promising ce valorisation potential for cities such as brussels the valorisation potential was identied here based on the generalised ranking of the waste hierarchy and needs to be completed by an lca that compares the environmental perfor mances of different valorisation options the datasets we developed enabled us to perform wastetype sector and treatmentspecic analyses of urban waste owscompared with conventional ewmfas based on statistical data the urban waste metabolism presented in this study is more detailed and offers more possibilities in terms of its application however this increase in detail comes at a cost the procedures of data conversion alignment and disaggregation inherently resulted in additional uncertainties highest uncertainties occur for metals glass and inert waste amounts and their distribution over economic sectors furthermore a general limitation of the approach is that the starting point is the amount of collected waste and not the amount of used products thus the role of ce measures based on products could not be fully captured in this study this limitation could be reduced by extending the waste inputoutput framework to phys ical product ows in this study we have developed waste supply and use tables as independent tables appended to economic supply and use tables that monitor product ows however to use the full analytical power of io analyses ie to calculate waste footprints and environ mental impacts the integration of these tables into the product ow matrix is needed as demonstrated in lenzen and reynolds and nakamura and kondo this study could nd few examples of systems which closed material cycles at city level however brussels has adopted a ce plan in only to increase the rates of reuse and of material recycling we identied target streams and proposed measures to exploit the unused valorisation potential however when consid ering the context of cities with a highly urbanized terrain it becomes evident that closing material cycles at city level may only work to a certain extent and is limited to certain ows thus we see the role of cities such as brussels in a ce mainly as provider of reusable products recyclable materials such as paper plastics metals glass and nutrients from organic waste rather than circu larity islands whether the closing of material cycles at city level has environmental benets compared to the national or global level needs to be further assessed based on comparative lca studies acknowledgement
