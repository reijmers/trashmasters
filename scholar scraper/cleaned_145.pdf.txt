economy to a circular model and to enhance the eciency of material use which is spelled out in the Circular Economy Promotion Law Measuring progress of the new policy requires datasets metrics and indicators that monitor theperformance of the economy regarding the scale of primary materials use waste ows and recycling and cir cularity We employ material ow analysis including measures for inputs and outputs to assess progress of the circular economy in China over time We nd that circularity increased from to between and from an input socioeconomic cycling rate perspective End of life waste recycling improved from to over the same time frame and occurred against the backdrop of a strong physical growth dynamic during this whole period We present a set of policy indicators and situate them in the context of the Chinese indicator sets for a Green Development Indicator System the Ecological Civilization Construction Assessment TargetSystem and the Sustainable Development Goals Moving from an economy based on infrastructure and capital investment production for the world market to a consumptionbased economy may increase the potential for circular economy in China in the future The policy indicators can also be used to set targets and create ambitionfor a swift transition to closed loop urban and industrial systems in China Introduction With global primary materials use soaring and China requiring an evergrowing share of the global natural resource base issues of supply security of primary materials and the associated environmental impacts of rising material demand have received increasing attention from the Chinese policy community The sheer scale of Chinese primary mate rials use of billion tons in Wang et al of a total of billion tons of global materials consumption Schandl et al UNEP has raised important issues around how to secure the required demand Geng et al and how to mitigate the en vironmental impacts of climate change Chen et al Hertwich et al UNEPIRP Yue et al biodiversity loss Lenzen et al resource depletion Wang et al Zhao et al and pollution Chen et al Qi et al Sun et al Yu et al across the supply chain of natural resourcesThe options discussed for reducing material use and improving re source e ciency in China include investment in new technologies and changes in consumption behavior of households and governments as well as improvements in the built environment Jiang et al Ma et al Wang et al Xu et al These objectives are addressed in the subsequent economic and reform plans of the Chinese government the veyear plans the Circular Economy Promotion Law National Peoples Congress of China and the broad intent to transition China to an ecological civilization by enabling social and economic outcomes to occur within planetary boundaries Steen et al The new policy objectives of economic resilience resource ef ciency and environmental sustainability deal with complex issues and require agreement on how to best approach the objectives and ensureeective and e cient outcomes from public policy initiatives To this end the knowledge base for evidencebased policy needs be improvedespecially with regard to

Conservation Recycling Elsevier BV All rights reserved Tcurrent rate of circularity ie the amount of secondary materials that reenter the economic process and to set ambitious policy targets for improving circularity in the future Such improvements may result from either a better recycling rate for end of life waste or a more fundamental restructuring of the Chinese economy resulting in a reduction of the overall amount of materials that are processed on a yearly basis In short this is what is aspired to by the circular economy CE which is based on redesigning major provision systems including housing mobility food energy and water in addition to improvements in major consumer good sectors for long lived goods The new information required for advancing circular economy policy is provided through comprehensive material ow accounts Pauliuk Schandl and Miatto which are complementary to economic accounts but report volumes of materials introduced to an economy through extraction or imports the production of goods for export and domestic markets and resulting waste and emissions Var ious previous studies have established accounts for material use in China Dai and Wang Wang et al Xu and Zhang but a standard set of material ow accounting indicators with a focus on circularity and comparable to other countries is still needed The accounting framework used in this study is based on internationally agreed methodological standards EUROSTAT and has been applied for the period Generating the results bene ts from previous studies of economic circularity Haas et al Jacobi et al Mayer et al but has required substantial and systematic reworking of the research strategy to accommodate the data char acteristics and data availability of China As a result we report a standard set of material ow accounting indicators with a focus on the output side and measure the circularity of the economy based on amaterial balance of the Chinese economy We complement the analysis with resource e ciency indicators and link the metrics used in this study to the data needs of newly established Chinese indicator sets and the Sustainable Development Goals Methods and data In this study we developed a monitoring framework for Chinas CE at the macro level based on the Chinese statistical system and previous research that linked EWMFA with secondary material ows to allow for monitoring CE in national economies Haas et al Jacobi et al Mayer et al Due to the large number and variety of material and waste ows involved in the framework up to categories of ows see SI the amount of data is very large For the sake of understanding we code each material ow and then introduce them in the CE model Fig monitoring indicators Table and data sources Table S in SI respectively Basic model and indicators for monitoring Chinas circular economy The basic monitoring framework for comprehensive material ow accounts of the Chinese economy is shown in Fig and enables us to trace main material and waste ow categories M M including the extraction of primary materials and imports the transformation of materials within the production system and outputs of commodities for export and disposal of emissions and waste Boxes represent the main stages of material ows across the entire socioeconomic system the origin of material inputs M Domestic extraction DE and M Import the transformation and processing stages M Processed materials PM M Energetic use eUse M Material use mUseM Solid and liquid wastes from energetic use M End of life EoL wastes and Societal inuse stocks and the destination

framework which is based on previous studies andguidelines Eurostat Haas et al Jacobi et al Krausmann et al Mayer et al Wang et al to construct a new dataset for China covering two decades from to Many of the indicators displayed in Table have become stan dard indicators that are calculated from material ow accounts and have been agreed by the research and statistical community Eurostat FischerKowalski et al Krausmann et al To enable the analysis of circularity a new category of secondary materials SM is introduced which refers to the recovery of materials through all forms of recycling reuse and remanufacturing and also includes downcycling and cascading Mayer et al Secondary materials include recycled materials from End of Life EoL wastes andindustrial solid wastes By adding DMC and SM we establish the amount of materials that are processed PM which is the apparent domestic consumption of materials with secondary ows included Processed materials PM are distinguished between Energetic use eUse andMaterial use mUse which has consequences for their further use pathways Energetic use comprises fossil fuels and biomass for energy production Not all fossil fuels are used for energy and a small fraction is used as a feedstock material eg plastics and bitumen The eUse of biomass mainly refers to fuel wood and the biomass used to generate metabolic energy for humans and livestock Employing the principle of conservation of mass net additions to stock NAS are calculated by gross additions to inuse stocks GAS minus demolition and discard where GAS equals mUse minus throughput materials The amount of throughput materials can be as certained directly from the Chinese statistical system On the output side except for DPO including DPO emissions and DPO wastes two additional indicators are introduced EoL wastes and Interim Outputs IntOut The former is equal to the sum of throughput materials demolition and discard and solid and liquid wastes from energetic use and the latter equals EoL waste plus DPO emissions It is notable that in contrast to previous studies we did not consider extractive wastes separately but included them in DPO wastes because in China these data are included in industrial solid wastes and they can be reused as SM eg metallurgical slag can be used to produce cement rather than emitted directly to the environment Input socioeconomic cycling rate ISCr share of PM and Output socioeconomic cycling rate OSCr share of IntOut are the main in dicators for monitoring the recycling of materials from the perspectives of the input side and output side respectively The ISCr is relatively signicantly a ected by changes in PM while the OSCr is less a ected since waste quantities are not dynamically coupled with EWMFA inputdata as a result of e ects from stock dynamics Jacobi et al Data The data sources and accounting methods for each basic material and waste ow are summarized in Table S in the SI and more detailed explanations of the categories of ows are provided in the SI using the year as a representative example Table S To complete theaccounting for all material ows we constructed six subaccounts fo cusing on waste ows which are also shown in the SI A Industrial solid waste reused A Industrial solid waste emitted A Household waste A Construction waste A Food balance and A Human and animal metabolism For category A Industrial solid waste reused and category A Industrial solid waste emitted we allocated Chinas industrial solid waste recycled or emitted from the original data from the China Environmental Statistics Yearbooks National Bureau of Statistics Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the proportions of di erent material categories biomass metal ores and metals nonmetallic minerals fossil fuels material use and energetic use were established using the classi cation from Mayer et al For category A Household waste we allocated Chinas householdwaste data available from the

Circular Economy in aggregated ows Unit Billion tonsH Wang et al Resources Conservation Recycling imports and secondary materials gained in importance Overall during the two decades China continued to rely heavily on domestic natural resources The share of material use of all processed materials grew over time from a share of billion tons in Fig to billion tons in and billion tons in Fig only billion tons in billion tons in and billion tons in were used for energy generation Most of the material use has been required for building up re sidential commercial and industrial infrastructure and transport and communication networks and was added to stocks GAS In the GAS was billion tons and with the rapid urbanization process it increased to billion tons in increasing by a factor of During these two decades the accumulated stock reached as high as billion tons which provides the physical basis of Chinas improving infrastructure Simultaneously very large amounts of construction de molition waste industrial solid waste and residential waste were dis posed of with only a small amount reentering the economic process as secondary materials through recycling For example in EoL waste was billion tons out of which only billion tons were recycled The remaining part was land lled or incinerated and disposed to theenvironment With increasing energy and biomass consumption Chinas DPO of emissions increased from billion tons in to billion tons in with an annual increasing rate of adding signicantly to global GHG emissions and making China one of the largest polluters globally While material use waste ows and emissions accelerated Chinas circularity rates also increased signi cantly The input socioeconomic cycling rate ISCr SM share of PM increased from to andthe output socioeconomic cycling rate OSCr SM share of IntOut in creased from to It is obvious that ISCr is much lower than OSCr because a large share of Chinas processed materials PM were added to stock and the interim outputs IntOut EoL waste DPO emissions were much lower than PM Compared to the European Union EU whose ISCr was in Mayer et al Chinas ISCr is signi cantly lower mainly because of the lack of a sound re cycling system and the large amount of GAS On the contrary Chinas OSCr is relatively higher than that of the EU whose OSCr was in because most of Chinas SM is from industrial solid waste and the central government has imposed mandatory targets utilization e ciency of general industrial solid waste for local governments andenterprises in recent years contributing to higher rates of end of life recycling Fig Comparison of Chinas biomass ows between and a and b show the biomass ows for the years and respectively Unit Billion tonsH Wang et al Resources Conservation Recycling Circularity of four major material groups Figs show the disaggregated ows for the four major material groups biomass fossil fuels metal ore and nonmetallic minerals in Chinas economy between and During the two decades biomass extraction increased from billion tons to billion tons and recycled biomass mainly from waste paper waste wood and re sidues increased from million tons to million tons increasing the ISCr of biomass from to and the OSCr from to Fig The biological cycles have very large potential for full circu larity which is far from being achieved in China Metal extraction also increased rapidly from billion tons to billion tons during Fig and in imported metal ores were as high as billion tons The high economic value and criticality of supply contributed result in a signi cant amount of secondary ma terials and higher recovery rates Speci cally the SM amount in cluding re ning waste increased from million tons to million tons resulting in comparatively high ISCr of in and in and OSCr of in and in This also re ects that metal recycling is economically viable and developed mar kets exist for secondary materials The main reason for making metalrecycling economically attractive is the very high energy costs of pri mary metal extraction Among the four groups nonmetallic minerals dominate material ows by volume eg of PM came from nonmetallic minerals in Fig Moreover due to its low economic value nearly all of Chinas PM of nonmetallic minerals is sourced from DE and therecycling rate is not as high as for metals despite the potential for reuseof construction demolition waste in road base Nevertheless the re cycled amount and recycling rate of nonmetallic minerals has been continuously increasing Recycled nonmetallic minerals grew by a factor of from million tons to million tons their ISCr in creased from to and their OSCr grew from to Even though the recycling rate has been increasing signi cantly there is still a large amount of waste from nonmetallic minerals released tothe environment due to the huge amount of consumption As only minor shares of fossil fuels went to stocks in the form of plastics and bitumen the recycled amount and recycling rate of fossil fuels are the lowest among the four material groups Fig In its SM amount was only around million tons and the ISCr and OSCrwere and respectively Twenty years later the SM amount of fossil fuels had increased to million tons meaning the ISCr and OSCr for both had increased to Increasing circularity in the en ergy sector will require a shift to renewable energy generation and away from burning fossil fuels Such a transition would result in someincrease in metals and would help combat climate change signi cantly Discussion This study provides a framework for measuring the progress of Chinas Circular Economy which is not only directly linked to Chinas Circular Economy policies but also linked to the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Chinese indicator sets for the th Five Year Plan the

Conservation Recycling the Ecological Civilization Construction Assessment Target System Based on the ndings above and these linkages policy implications are provided for the Circular Economy and sustainable development ofChina Discussion on ndings and policy implications The physical scale of the Chinese economy ie processed materials PM per capita increased by a factor of from tcap in to tcap in As a consequence of this rapid growth per capita PM in China is now higher than in the EU tcap and in Austria tcap for which similar analysis is available Jacobi et al Mayer et al of processed materials were used in biological and technical supply chains and only used in energy provision which also contributes to a higher level of Gross additions to stock GAS for China compared to the European Union and is explained by Chinas massive infrastructure build up During around billion tons of materials were ac cumulated as stock of buildings and infrastructure including residential and commercial buildings industrial infrastructure and transport and communication networks While material use has grown the growth rate has decelerated foreshadowing that Chinas resource consumption may peak in the near future As a result it has been suggested that thefocus of Chinas sustainable resource use policy should gradually shift from consumption reduction to sustainable management of stocks Krausmann et al Wiedenhofer et al for example through increasing the lifetime of infrastructure and using recyclablemodular buildings Cao et al At the same time a large amount of longlived consumer goodsaccumulated during the studied period and China will gradually enterthe scrap stage and generate huge amounts of secondary materials such as scrap steel Xuan and Yue Yue et al copper Zhang et al aluminum Chen and Shi Li et al Yue et al and electronic waste Zeng et al Ef fectively recycling of end of life waste will depend on improved wastemanagement and recycling infrastructure and will determine the extent to which China can reduce primary virgin material demand in the future In the past years China has made great progress in the com prehensive utilization of industrial solid waste which is the main reason why Chinas endresource recycling rate has reached EU level After entering the scrap stage another transition in waste management and recycling capability for comprehensive treatment of end of life consumer waste will be required In addition to focusing on these two shifts in Chinas future a comprehensive indicator system that allows reporting of primary ma terial demand in the economy greenhouse gas emissions and waste disposal in one coherent analytical framework is also needed for policy development Focusing on end of life waste recycling reducing waste to landll and improving resource e ciency to address waste issues at the source are all worthwhile shortterm policy principles that are noregretstrategies While resource e ciency reduces cost and is economically attractive HateldDodds et al climate mitigation has a short term cost Waste recycling is economically worthwhile for metals butthis is not generalizable for all materials In the medium term Fig to years the economy requires structural adjustments to help reduce waste ows through designing new materials products and processes that service the needs of the Fig Comparison of Chinas

considerably fewer materials and result in sig nicantly less waste and lower emissions Changes in supply chains that allow for redesign of production and consumption promise much largereconomic bene t compared to shortterm changes of reduce reuse and recycle They may generate the economic and employment opportunities of the future enabled through the bio digital and circular economies In the long run urban and industrial systems must be established asclosed loop systems in order to allow wellbeing and living standards for large numbers of people and within planetary boundaries Generalizing high living standards for billion people needs lots of additional nat ural resources and will add additional pressure on material supply systems and will continue to overshoot planetary boundaries Closing the loop allows to relieve some of this pressure and avoids the need of tapping into those natural resource reserves that have the largest ne gative social and environmental impacts IRP Urban industrial symbiosis also called industrial and urban symbiosis in some literature Dong et al Geng et al Sun et al promises a restructuring of the way in which cities and industries are operated as closed loop systems Linking circular economy indicators to key policies China has been making progress in the promotion of circular economy CE for decades and has published around CE or resource use related laws policies and regulations Zhu et al To monitor and evaluate the e ectiveness of the Circular Economy Promotion Law new CE metrics and indicators have been proposed for the macro economy and for industrial parks Geng et al McDowall et al Most circularity indicators focus on speci c materials or waste ows such as the recycling rate of iron scrap nonferrous metals waste Fig Comparison

Recycling paper plastics rubber and industrial solid waste and there is a lack of indicators and clear targets for general whole of economy recycling rates on both the input and output sides Moreover because of the lack of a detailed and standardized accounting process signi cant barriers to the implementation of the new indicators exist Therefore this study can be regarded as an important reference for establishing indicators of circularity for the whole economy In order to realize the full potential of CE it is important to link CE indicators to existing key policy priorities and decision processes We present a set of CE indicators and situate these in the context of the SDGs the Chinese indicator sets for the th Five Year Plan Central Committee of the Communist Party of China the Ecological Civilization Construction Assessment Target System NDRC a and the Green Development Indicator System NDRC b Table At the global level several indicators provided by this study can be directly or indirectly linked to the SDGs Schroeder et al UNSTATS For example there are three SDGs for which MFA based indicators have been selected to monitorprogress by the Inter Agency Expert Group namely SDG SDG and SGD For SDGs and the standard indicators of Do mestic Material Consumption and Material Footprint are used to cal culate resource productivity SDG and percapita material use SDG Reporting on the output side and for circularity allows to inform SDG in triremes of recycling rate and total endof life waste and waste to land ll However only half of them can be related to the key national po licies of China most of which are focused on the utilization of industrial solid waste energy consumption emissions reduction and intensity indicators This study can contribute to measuring these indicators For instance resource productivity is an important indicator in ChinasGreen Development Indicator System but it still lacks a stan dardized accounting method in China Regarding general national cir cularity indicators Japan and the EU countries have already set this indicator as one of the main monitoring indicators for CE European Commission Moriguchi and this research provides a timely and necessary reference both on perspectives ofindicator selection and a standardized accounting process Research limitations There are several limitations to our approach to accounting for Chinas CE indicators that we would like to acknowledge The whole CE framework includes the following basic material ows input ows output ows secondary materials and stocks and the generally pro blematic data are from the latter three ows Regarding input ows we divided the processed materials of biomass and fossil fuels into energetic use and material use materials but we can only nd the pro portion for biomass and wechose to use the proportion of energetic usefor fossil fuels from Mayer et al Regarding output ows even though the Chinese National Statistical O ce publishes annual data on industry solid waste and household waste there is no distinction between the four types of material groups Therefore we adopted the proportion coe cients of these four material groups for EU countries from Mayer et al As Chinese economic structure and waste treatment levels are di erent from EU countries this coe cient transplant could cause a degree of uncertainty and the nal indicators may be sensitive to this As for SM although the development of CE in China started earlier the statistics for SM data are relatively recent and most of them are from uno cial sources Thus in this study the SM of several materials eg wastepaper waste plastic and steel scrap wasderived from di erent literature In addition for a few years between and there was no data available for several recycled materials which we used the linear interpolation method to estimate Stock data is another important issue Fishman et al Krausmann et al Miatto et al which relates to the other three main ma terial ows However there is little o cial data on Chinese stocks Liu et al and related construction waste including recycled and disposal waste In this study we estimated these data based on the limited o cial data and a relevant study Zheng et al see A in the SI Overall the above limitations call for a comprehensive and fastimprovement in the Chinese statistical system for CE Conclusion This study has provided a framework for measuring the progress of Chinas Circular Economy including a CE model datasets metrics and indicators monitoring the performance of the economy regarding the scale of primary materials use waste ows and recycling and circu larity Using this framework the Chinese CE situation during has been examined The results indicate that during the study period on the input side Chinas Processed Materials sum of DMC and Secondary Materials increased by a factor of from billion tons to billion tons which is dominated by DE of nonmetallic minerals On the output side Chinas Interim Outputs sum of DPO of emissions and DPO of waste increased by a factor of from billion tons to billion tons The di erence between Processed Materials and Interim Outputs con tributed more than billion tons of Net Additions to Stock Apartfrom the input side and output side material ow indicators Chinas circularity rates also increased dramatically The Input SocioeconomicCycling
