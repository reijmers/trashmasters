nability, and, as a result, so does the modern economic system 
(Korhonen et al. 2018 ). The twin issues of reliance on finite resources and 
the environmental damage caused by waste mean that discussions on the 
future of the model have been given potency in contemporary debates on 
climate change mitigation and sustainable development. The circular 
model is discussed as a more sustainable cyclical flow model which reduces 
negative environmental impact by reducing reliance on virgin resources 
and recycling existing resources from waste. Academically, the concept 
emerges from industrial ecology, industrial symbiosis, product-service sys -
tems, remanufacturing, corporate responsibility, sharing economy and 
zero waste (Ranta et al. 2018 ). The circular approach places emphasis on 
product, component and material reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishment, 
repair, renewable energy utilisation throughout the product value chain, 
and cradle-to-cradle life cycle. Andersen ( 2007 ) also presents a simple 
model of a circular model (Fig.  3.2).
In this model, the components of (r) for recycling and (W) for waste 
are added to close the loop so the economy becomes circular. Andersen 
(2007 , 134) points out that not all waste can be recycled, ‘partly due to 
missed opportunities and partly due to some basic physical laws’. How 
such waste can be managed remains a challenging issue involving the 
potentially environmentally harmful options of landfill and incineration.RP CU
