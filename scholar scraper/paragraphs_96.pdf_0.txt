netherlands received april revised november final version received november this article examines how the political economy of waste utility services is changing in response to circular economy programs it focuses on the financial composition economic position and geography of three sectors waste recycling incineration andurban waste reuse building on an empirical analysis of these sectors in the netherlands specifically the amsterdam cityregion it puts forward three key arguments first waste recovery corporations are becoming increasingly global anddependent on steady flows of waste second incineration facilities play a central yet uncertain role in planning for the circular economy third the circular economy is driving an emerging material reuse market in cities the paper concludes by arguing that ongoing changes in waste markets run the risk of making circular economies even more dependent on wasteful consumption and production keywords circular economy cityregions political economy of waste waste recovery amsterdam introduction this paper offers an empirical account of the ongoing impact of circular economy pro grams on waste markets in this way it develops a politicaleconomic critique of current attempts to realize circular economy principles and questions the extent to whichthey are effectively reducing waste today governments at all levels are devising policy programs with the aim of increasing resource productivity and waste recovery in different sectors gregson et al in a greengrowth framework these programs are garnering broad support among corporations developing new business models for maximizing the recovery of secondary materials as well as from civic enterprises active in waste reuse and reduction corvellec et al urbinati chiaroni and chiesa the concept of the circular economy is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in policy arenas across the spectrum of public and private actors it is mobilized to devise infrastructural social and institu tional reforms oriented toward decoupling economic growth from resource depletion circular economy models critique linear sectorbased production and consumption chains which result in residuals of low or no value they propose an approach geared toward maximizing resource productivity at all stages of production and consumption cemail fsaviniuvanl c the authors published by informa

and rutqvist in practice the circular economy is an umbrella term for a large variety of infrastructural social and economic policies seeking to minimize waste blomsma and brennan fitchroy benson and monciardini it functions as a moral discourse through which diverse actors justify very different resource effi ciency strategies gregson et al friant vermeulen and salomone it is being mobilized to promote economic reforms in disparate sectors from waste recov ery to smart logistics ecoconsumption to material reuse being highly versatile the notion of the circular economy takes paradoxical turns on the one hand it demands a radical project of socioecological change on the other attempts to realize its princi ples often rely on ecomodernization strategies reike vermeulen and witjes in sum as reike vermeulen and witjes put it the fundamental paradig matic questions of circular economy conceptualization remain indeed unsolved to understand the circular economy s potential for and effects on longterm eco nomic production and consumption it is crucial to move from elaborating conceptual prototypes of circularity to undertaking empirical analyses of how policy making and investment markets are adopting and reacting to this notion the extent to which circu larity can effectively reduce waste depends on how it is actualized in new regulations infrastructures and consumption practices available studies show that the circular economy is slowly urging public governments to adopt more direct responsibilities in reaching targets of waste reuse energy efficiency and water management bolger and doyon campbelljohnston et al cramer savini savini and giezen they also indicate that circularity is inspiring everyday practices of alternative waste reuse dembek hobson and lynch some of these stud ies explicitly warn that the economic system emerging from these developments repro duces wasteful consumerism valenzuela and b ohm these studies show that circular economy discourses are having a variety of impacts on how households and municipal governments manage waste depending on the context at hand gregson and crang schramm and thi thanh mai zapata and zapata campos despite this evidence these studies do not advance a critical analysis of circular itys systemic impact on the waste management sector in particular not only did cur rent conceptualizations of the circular economy emerge from the waste management sector but they have the most purchase in this policy area ragossnig and schneider it seems that the circular economy is used primarily to valorize waste as a strat egy of economic social and environmental sustainability positioning residuals and their reduction at the center of policy making and implementation many waste manag ers still understand circularity as an effective mode of recycling and waste recovery aguilarhernandez et al what is more the notion of the circular economy is deeply rooted in early prototypes of industrial symbiosis which were adopted to valor ize industrial waste as a secondary material for other industrial production processes chertow despite waste s centrality to resource efficiency studies looking spe cifically at circularity s effect on the waste recovery market are surprisingly scarce to address this empirical gap this paper shows how the waste market has adapted to the growing prominence of circular economy targets over the last two decades to that end it traces the evolution of three key waste sectors in recent years waste recov ery incineration and urban materials reuse across these sectors it focuses on three dimensions of the circular economy of waste the waste industry s financial compos ition the position of waste recovery processes in economic development and the geog raphy of waste infrastructures in attending to the case of the netherlands and honing f saviniin on the amsterdam cityregion the paper traces the changing political economy of waste markets from the early s to late it shows that the wasteprocessing market is using three main strategies to adapt to notions of circularity consolidating a multinational and integrated sector of waste collection and processing increasingly diversifying activities relating to wastetoenergy incineration infrastructures and fos tering a nascent albeit marginal sector of urban waste recovery the article beings by explaining its analytical framework contextualizing the three dimensions of the following analysis in relation to economic institutional and geo graphical trends in the waste sector between the early s and today after outlining the study s methodology it presents the analysis of each of the three identified waste sectors the article concludes by analyzing specific trends in the changing waste mar ket questioning the extent to which they make that market better suited to addressing circular priorities of waste reduction the financial composition position and geography of waste markets the first dimension of the waste economy analyzed in this paper concerns how waste management and waste utilities are financed and economically sustained this strand of my analysis problematizes changes in monetary flows of credit and debt in the funding of waste infrastructures the articulation between governmental and corporate services in the provision of waste utilities and calculations of risk that underlie corpor ate strategies for maximizing the value of residual materials the second dimension of my analysis the position of waste recovery processes in economic development points instead at the relationship between waste management and other economic sectors it examines the extent to which waste infrastructures and policies are being variously integrated into or isolated from other innovation and investment sectors such as logistics data technologies and the built environment it also grapples with the ques tion of how legislation is enabling synergies between the waste sector and these other domains finally in looking at the geography of waste infrastructures the third dimen sion of my analysis uncovers the shifting scales and distribution of waste markets and infrastructures in so doing i mean to capture the extent to which wastetoresource flows are reshaped geographically across local national and international borders these three dimensions are interrelated and influence each other the waste industry s changing financial composition shapes connections among different sectoral invest ments and waste s position amid economic and financial flows in turn these financial flows materialize geographically as new waste infrastructures my analysis is rooted in the politicaleconomic critiques developed by regulation theory in geography and planning studies boyer jessop devised to study how capitalist economies cope with economic crises this theoretical framework makes it possible to observe how particular institutional political and economic contexts mediate emergent approaches to development it allows researchers to problematize the ways in which ambitions for sustainable development which might involve renew ables or resource productivity are institutionalized as new systems of production while jonas and gibbs while jonas and gibbs honing in on modes of regulation the institutional architecture that gives shape to markets this theoret ical framework adopts a historical approach to dissecting shifting regimes of accumu lation that is the modes of production and consumption that prevail in given periods as such it grasps a particular economic system s contingent industrial composition journal of environmental planning and management the articulation among markets financial circuits technologies and institutions in so doing this framework opens up critical reflection on possible contradictions in emer gent economic models in adopting this framework this paper is motivated by an urge to grasp what many expect to be the huge impact of circular economy models on the current system of commodity production and consumption in particular the waste sector the waste sec tor has very peculiar features which demand that circular economy programs are seen in the context of the ongoing institutional financial and economic restructuring of the waste market from the late s onward the european landfill directive ec in particular signalled a turning point in the evolution of the waste market in europe it set a common waste hierarchy that incentivized a recovery of materials and set the grounds for circular economy programmes fitchroy benson and monciardini from the late s the financial composition and the position and the geography of the waste industry has been pro gressively changing toward three directions a the codependency of public utilities and private waste services b the institutional upscaling toward national and european regulatory frameworks which coincide with the emergence of an economy of scale in the waste sector c the suburbanization of waste infrastructures despite the growing presence of private players in the waste market since the late s public authorities have remained central actors in processing collecting regu lating and cofunding waste infrastructures the waste market was liberalized relatively recently compared to telecommunications energy water and housing massarutto oecd the higher risks involved in waste investments for both public and private players slowed down full liberalization the adaptation of the waste sectorto circular economy principles is influenced by the inherent instability of waste flows across time and the long periods necessary for recuperating the substantial investments in the logistics and infrastructures for distributing storing and processing combined with the very low marginal values of processed waste until the late s the value of recovered materials from waste remained much lower in comparison to the more convenient prices of imported raw materials producers had and still have less incen tive to switch to secondary materials because raw material costs have a low impact on overall production costs wilting and hanemaaijer the price difference between recycled materials and raw materials remained stable until ten years ago when the pri ces of the critical raw materials necessary for hightech infrastructures shot upeuropean commission because of these risks and costs waste remained a tightly regulated service with a strong presence of public authorities or in some cases an attractive sector for illicit and illegal activities d amato et al it also remained relatively disconnected from other sectors of economic development particularly realestate finance and theknowledge industry public authorities also in the netherlands operated the most costly and difficult steps of waste recovery such as collection of household waste at the source as well as separation and incineration de jong and wolsink large cities in particular with their complex fabrics congested infrastructure and diversity of economic functions require a broad capillary collection service which is costly capillary collection of recyclable waste requires a system of daily transport and human labor doortodoor while it generates low yields in terms of purity of waste an important factor for the financial returns of waste recovery private waste management companies have generally preferred to invest in the industrial nonhousehold waste f savinimarket hall and nguyen in the commercial waste sector streams are often more homogeneous and less territorially dispersed with a steady flow assisting thelongterm business planning under conditions of low raw material prices the conversion of waste into energy primarily through wte remained a preferred solution for municipalities after the eu landfill directive from the early s incineration capacity has been growing acrossthe globe with new incinerators worldwide and a increase in the eu between and today northern and western eu countries incinerate of all waste wilts and von gries municipalities still see wastetoenergy plants as a longterm investment on postfossil sources of energy yet the longterm investments necessary to set up these facilities do create significant lockins the production of energy and heat from incineration requires steady waste flows and clashes with waste reduction targets such a lockin is essential to under stand the functioning of waste markets at large the longterm guarantee of adequate wasteflows is crucial in a market that requires large investments the waste materials market issomehow the opposite of financial markets where quick transactions are strategic for profits waste processing suffers downturns in supply and demand because investments have very long repayment times these investments involve deployment of largescale technolo gies land use permission and preparation storage and distribution facilities as well as theprocess costs of dealing with all the regulations involved in waste management since the s governments at all levels of scale engaged in a series of regulatory actions to ensure long term stability in the waste sector and open up opportunities to spe cialize the waste market regulations at eu and national level were homogenized to builda common waste hierarchy fitchroy benson and monciardini g a b a l l a ha n d kanari national requirements not only homogenized the standards for waste proc essing from collection to recovery but also structured the sector by creating specialized accountancy models of waste the european frameworks on common waste inducedmember states into schemes of waste accountancy that regulate different subcategories ofwaste including common recyclables such as paper glass biomass metals but alsohighly specialized waste such as tires mattresses batteries chemicals tapes and paint as the formally recognized waste categories multiplied the waste market became more finegrained creating opportunities to monetize each waste substream iemonostreams yet substream recovery requires an international market that can tolerate the risks of longterm investments in capillary and specialized materials recovery private investors did welcome and actively demanded these regulations to enable them to extract value from their composite waste streams the main examples are the elec tronics sector the subcomponents of building and demolition waste the precious metals in integrated circuits and the processing of electronic parts these regulatory reforms changed the position of the waste industry within national and international economic development policies waste management companies startedto locate themselves not only as necessary actors in dealing with the increasing flows ofwaste but also as economic groups of multinational corporations that could effectively combine different kinds of utilities they started to slowly diversify their portfolio to capture the more remunerative monostream businesses worrell and reuter this new position also started to reshape the geography of waste utilities as mar kets simultaneously localized and globalized within cityregions publicprivate part nerships in waste processing emerged to set up a more cost effective and integrated management of waste davoudi journal of environmental planning and management the mids eu regulations initiated a bifurcation in the geography of waste on the one hand the most undesirable streams or those that could not be processedbecause of limited infrastructure capacity where delocalized to farflung points of theplanet gregson and crang european common waste regulation overlapped with the building of a european and intercontinental waste market waste types that werevery difficult and costly to process on site were shipped to countries with low man ual labor costs and weaker environmental standards gregson and crang on the other hand the waste streams that could be processed on site were more strictly regulated and thus less profitable to recover the outcome was regionalizationas waste sites for specialized processing multiplied around urban agglomerations wastestreams coming from city regions were relocalized to storage and processing sites closer to the source particularly in dense urban agglomerations with available industrial facili ties davoudi g a n d y the wastelands of the s started to look like healthy industrial sites close to urban agglomerations rather than areas of dumping andlandfills that triggered nimby reactions throughout the s from a wasteland they turned into wastescapes amenta and van timmeren areas unlocking the unex plored economic potential of the waste sector today these locations are strategic hubsfor a specialized waste market because they provide proximity to industrial facilities integrated processing and accessibility to national and international logistics networks these areas offered industrial synergies for the monetization of residual materials andbecame the testbeds of the early prototypes of the circular economy in what follows i will zoom into the specific context of amsterdam cityregion to show in detail how the changing financial composition position and geography of the waste market has changed parallel to the popularity of circular economy discourses to do so i will analyze separately three key waste submarkets the sectors of wasterecycling and recovery incineration and urban waste reuse methodology the research at the base of this paper asked the question how have waste markets reacted to the ambitions of resource efficiency proposed by circular economy pro grammes in the last decade it was carried out through three subsequent steps under taken between late and late first archival research on the evolution of thewaste market in the last years was conducted documents on waste utilities wereretrieved from online archives and libraries to study the changing geography of wasteinfrastructures this phase identified the key companies and governmental bodies forthe interviews of the next phase second the researcher conducted semistructuredinterviews with different actors active in waste management interviewees represented the major waste utility providers in the region and the startups in circular consultancy waste corporations and their institutional representatives ie the association of wastemanagement companies public waste utility companies managing waste collectionpoints the incinerator and its related companies and consultancy firms that advisepublic governments on material efficiency and the circular economy see table third after the interviews the yearly financial reports of the interviewed companies were scrutinized to obtain an overview of their business strategies and their costs and returns these findings were crosschecked through a close analysis of media articlesfrom financial investigations dealing with the waste sector f saviniin order to reveal the key factors that shape the business case of private and public companies the interviews were coded along an operational definition of the three ana lytical dimensions financial composition positionality and geography a the invest ment corporate strategies of the companies b the relationship between these corporations and the public authorities including the response to regulatory reforms and c the strategies of integration between different waste investments the internationalization of waste recovery markets in the netherlands the circular economy entered the mainstream policy discourse just five years ago as a political response to the growing concerns with resource scarcity for a geneaology of the idea in dutch policy making see savini here i show that this increase in popularity was parallel to a changing financial composition positionality and geography of the waste recovery market in specific directions the eco nomic renewal and expansion of the sector through corporate mergers the acquisition of a more central position within the whole range of utility services and the geograph ical repositioning through integrated industrial hubs next to urban denser areas as discussed above waste has always been an appealing commodity for the waste disposal sector but investments in waste have become much more central to govern ments and private corporations since early s as an interviewee reported thegrowing economic output of the netherlands the increase in consumption and the changing eu regulations to promote recovery led to an increasing optimism in the waste sector that stimulated investments in the longterm improvement of waste facili ties with a large increase in the financial capacity of waste companies table list of interviewed

the aftermath of the financial crisis however the sector faced decreasing waste volumes due to the downturn in production and consumption namlis and komilis the to period witnessed a deep readjustment of the sector character ized by a rush of fusions acquisitions and mergers the dutch het financieele dagblad defined this period as the stage of a fusion wave driven by the combined decrease of margins of waste companies the relatively stable dutch economic context and the low interest rate investment repayments were ensured by mergers and acquisitions of waste management firms leading to the diversification of their portfolios by integrating waste with other utilities water logistics the enlargement of their geographical reach multinational and the strengthening of their capacity to deal with different regulatory contexts crosscountry and intercontinental see also ing the story of one of the biggest waste management companies in the netherlands gives insights on these processes today renewiicova renewi from now on is one of the largest waste management companies in the country it is a listed multinational corporation active in nine countries with about workers and is the premier private and commercial waste processor in the region of amsterdam like all waste management companies renewi is presenting itself as a leader in the waste recovery and recycling sector with about million tonnes of waste processed annu ally in the netherlands an ecosystem of services covering all steps from collection to recovery renewi the genealogy of this company is representative of how waste recovery has been changing since the early s to improve efficiency the company is the result of the fusion between the formerly largest dutch waste group van gasenwinkel and the english utilities group shanks this was the last step of a series of mergers andacquisitions aimed at addressing the difficulties of the afvalverwerking rijmond avr in the early s avr was the largest public waste management company in south holland processing onethird of all waste in the country and owned the second largest incinerator in the country in avr was sold for eur billion to an international private equity invest ment fund made up of three companies the english cvc capital partners the american kkr private investment fund and the dutch oranje nassau investment funds t h e enlargement of the financial reach of the firm was driven by the high expectations of the sector at that time the sale was followed by a doubling of the debt of the company due to the increasing investments in facilities to respond to the anticipated increase inwaste volume one year later avr grew even further buying the dutch waste manage ment company van gasenwinkel holding a large loss and forming the van gasenwinkel group the group became internationally active in water energy infrastructure and waste sectors the rising debts the steady low prices of raw materials and the low increase of waste streams due to the economic recession put the group under severestrain as a result in the avr incinerator of the group was sold to a chinese investor cheung kong infrastructure for about eur million almost half the purchase price the chinese investment group was already active in the port infrastruc ture and retail sectors in the netherlands and now added the country s largest private wte power station to its portfolio in the other half of the van gasenwinkel group was sold to the uk company shanks for about half a billion euros today renewi is a private group of several monostream companies with facili ties strategically located next to dense urban agglomerations the group manages sev eral steps of the waste recovery chain obtaining waste transporting it to their own f savinisubsidiaries selling it when possible to their own waste processing companies and finally selling the secondary materials renewi owns four monostream firms mineralz processes demolition waste at nine locations across the netherlands and belgium producing concrete in combination with other raw materials coolrec man ages electronics plastic and nonferrous materials in seven countries in europe and owns onethird of the european advanced recycling network for weee maltha recycles glass in locations in europe it also owns orgaworld the largest mono stream firm treating biomass bioenergy and gasification to produce electricity and sup plying heating providers renewi these companies are all located in the port of amsterdam just km from the city center which offers good potentials for industrial synergy with a concentration of installations processing biomass from residual oil orgaworld is located in the socalled greenmills complex in amsterdam an industrial symbiosis of different firms involved in residual oil collection tank cleaning and biodiesel this complex includes four com panies owned by the simadan group the largest biodiesel producer in england noba biodiesel amsterdam tankstorage amsterdam and also includes the company rotie which manages expired food owned by orgaworld itself this infrastructure of integrated firms is able to capture the most capillary sources of waste and is setting up startups in circular products such as the reuse of orange skins to make essential oils and animal food ie peelpioneers this capillarization is enabling these firms to col lect waste right at the source particularly in dense urban areas where it joins the advantages of an emerging market of urban waste reuse please see below other dutch waste management companies have followed identical pathways in remondis a eur billion multinational giant of waste and ecological services in countries purchased the dutch company dusseldorp groep specialized in the reuse of building materials suez the french giant in water waste of its busi ness and environmental services entered the dutch market in by buying of shares of sita netherlands a company managing waste from half of all dutch munic ipalities indaver a waste management company in north holland was bought by the swedish multiutility company delta nv the belgian venture capital investor vlaamse milieuholding and a group of industrial shareholders this overview shows the financial consolidation of the waste market in the country and europe a network of companies owned by multinational investors that link differ ent regional forms for each waste category the interviewees of these companies all reported that it is only through this integrated system of companies that it is possible to deliver effective waste recovery despite the relatively lower value of secondary materials on the market and the relatively low price of primary materials as one of those epitomized you need the largest volumes to start up a process not the small scale some people say small is beautiful but it is hard to start the mergers how ever also allowed many companies suffering under oversupply of processing capacity and volatile waste volumes to secure the necessary resources for setting up integrated systems of waste recovery today these groups are at the forefront of circular resource management a sector in full expansion waste flows are growing due to the booming dutch economy revenues are also growing because of the consequent undersupply of processing capacity in the country and the stringent regulations against incineration a new wave of investments is underway especially in efficiency technology circular reuse of materials specialization of the monostreams and further capillary develop ment renewi suez journal of environmental planning and management the rise and fall of waste to energy wastetoenergy from here wte has been and still is the main modality of waste management in the netherlands because it is used as a source of energy and heat it is therefore important to look at the changing financial composition and positionality of this sector to understand if and how circular economy models are having an impact on integrated waste and energy systems while circular economy models may consider wte as the least desirable strategy for waste recovery the role of incinerators is muchmore complex in european circular economy ambitions malinauskaite et al european commission such ambivalence is visible in amsterdam s circular economy measures which did not question incineration at large but rather repositioned it within the economic development of the cityregions amsterdam wte sector underwent a progressive diversification and strengthening of its position within regional waste utility services and regional urban economic develop ment in the netherlands the increasing waste volumes combined with the undersupply of processing facilities and the steadily low taxation on incineration resulted in higher gate fees for waste incineration ie the price that waste producers pay to the incineratorthese higher yields further stimulated longterm investments in wte infrastructures with the incineration of industrial waste increasing by between and ademe the national governmentmaintained taxes on incineration remained low through out the s to spur transition away from landfilling and incentivize district heating and electricity production hanemaaijer rood and kruitwagen the amsterdam waste and energy company afval en energieberdrijf from now on aeb followed a path of financial expansion and infrastructural enlargement it repositioned itself as a central player in the cityregional energy policy by changing its profile from its core business of incineration to a larger variety of projects spinoffsand experiments in the field of circularity the first wte station opened in amsterdam harbor in on the site of an incinerator built in it started to provide district heating in when together with the energy provider nuon at that time a public energy provider the aeb funded the holding westpoort warmte the first residual heat provider for the city the success led the company to expand its stations opening a new highefficiency station in the port of amsterdam in to supply these facili ties from the mids aeb established transnational import routes in thetotal capacity of the dutch wte market was million tonnes with a total national supply of million tonnes rijkswaterstaat in the amsterdam wte plant covered about of its capacity tonnes of tonnes total through imports of uk waste recovered only of the total processed waste and produced about of the total sustainable energy used in the city through inciner ation of organic material aeb the year marked the peak of business optimism in the amsterdam wte mar ket in the words of the former alderman for economic affairs carolien gehrels our wastetoenergy plant is a moneymaking machine so i always say garbage is gold circular economy policy programmes were an opportunity to stimulate the aeb in light of the accumulated investments since the mids the earliest policy pro grammes for integrated waste and energy infrastructures aimed at repositioning aeb at the center of the city s transition in both the energy and waste sectors as a key player in the circular economy of the city municipality of amsterdam since amsterdam s wte sector mutated in two ways on the one hand the increased price of raw materials and the enlargement of waste recovery see above f savinimade incineration a less profitable means of waste treatment on the other hand the available wte plants provided an existing infrastructure to address the increasing pres sure from central government to scale up sustainable energy production just before the publication of the national energy agenda in ministry of economic affairs amsterdam s municipal government decided to reduce the use of natural gas to zero by thereby opening up a new market for the biomass sector as an alterna tive to coal and ground gas municipality of amsterdam the ambition to sup ply up to homes with heat from biomass incineration led the aeb to relabel its incineration business as green energy and to diversify its activities to set the institutional capacity for this transition the aeb became a private entity with public shares in the privatization was expected to give aeb flexibil ity to invest in the budding circular economy to sign contracts with suppliers to invest in new biomass stations to explore secondary materials substreams and con solidate the residual heat infrastructure from aeb planned the expansion of its residual heat holding wespoort warmte with plans to increase its infrastructure from to homes by strengthened with a further investment of eur million in underground infrastructure toward the northern and eastern areas of the city in the last four years aeb also became more active in the waste market initiating a series of projects in the field of smart infrastructures and integrated waste and energy services in aeb invested eur million to open a postcollection separation facility for household and commercial waste the recycling service centrum expected to double in size by in addition to this investment the company introduced sev eral programmes for substream specialized recycling a programme to reuse diaperstogether with procter gamble a certification programme for electronic waste and to process the chemicals in paint residuals since aeb is also realizing plans to establish a carbon capture and utilization programme to deliver the co emitted from incineration to ocap the underground pipe transferring co from north holland to the glasshouses in south holland finally also in the aeb announced the decision to invest eur million in building a biomass power plant bioenergie central to deliver gj of energy this supplyled strategy was based on the expectation that by increasing and diver sifying waste processing capacity aeb would become a competitive player in the cir cular economy of the region as a former circular economy strategist at aeb declaredduring an interview incineration should end but the fact that we have incineration to make predictable profits makes it possible to make plans for the transition to a new waste management plan to enable a transition toward a circular economy aeb and the municipality of amsterdam embarked on a risky path of investments that while diversifying its recovery facilities made these facilities codependent on a steady supply of waste in in light of the persistently insufficient returns on the investments aeb s executives and the city council decided to refinance the company with a new stream of loans and to detach the aeb from the municipal budget combined with the increased taxes on incineration the aeb turned from a waste dream to a ticking bomb the same year the court of audits of the metropolitan region amsterdam warned the city of the imminent financial risks of a fully privately owned company that on the one hand operates as a private investor in the waste market and on the other enjoys an exclu sive right to process waste in the city rekenkamer metropool amsterdam thejournal of environmental planning and management report problematized the vicious circle incentivizing the exploitation rather than the reduction of waste that ties the public interest in waste disposal to the return expecta tions of a private corporation in july aeb triggered the biggest waste crisis of the country when due to a technical problem the facility had to close four of its six ovens for almost five months the partial interruption of activities revealed the fragility of its investment strategy which counted on the continuous expansion of the waste market amsterdam waste was redirected to landfills the company was put on sale the enlargement plans for the recycling facility have been put on hold and the construction of a biomass station has been stopped today the aeb is concentrating on its core business of wte the emerging urban economy of waste reuse as illustrated above from the mid onwards ambitions of resource efficiency pushed waste management companies dealing with monostreams to expand and fueled investments in the dutch wte market however it also generated a parallel circuit of urban waste recovery with original features on the one hand the urban waste recov ery market started to largely diversify both geographically and financially it features a constellation of small and medium firms that are highly specialized in the recovery of specific waste fractions and types mostly present in cities on the other this emerging market started to play a crucial role in the strengthening of the circular economy as a policy program of infrastructural social and economic reform at different levels of scale while operating at an urban and neighborhood scale it also links the nationaland global waste value chain in a report published on the economic benefits of the circular economy first highlighted the economic position of such a sector within the national economy the study referred to the compensation of a partial loss in terms of new manufacturing due to reuse of products with an increase in jobs and gdp from sectors related tourban repair component retrofit maintenance and upcycling eur billion and jobs tno such study captured the expected economic benefits of the earliest urban experiments in circular materials reuse in urban areas during the deepest years of the global financial crisis between and amsterdam became a hot bed of startups in the field of waste recovery and material reuse in contrast to the fro zen real estate sector in more than onethird of all new firms operated in the handicrafts market with producing consumables with among others reused materials this sector grew tentimes faster than the national economy municipality of amsterdam this creative economy generally known as the makers industry morozov took the shape of a network of mini startups active in diy produc tion selfbuilding repair and digitalized manufacturing the attractiveness of these economic opportunities in times of financial downturn motivated a wave of urban experimentation geared at stimulating new forms of sus tainable urban economies around the notion of circular development politically adver tised as the new resource economy of the city grondstoffeneconomie the first circular economy visions benchmarked the strategic importance to invest in circularliving labs at microurban scale municipality of amsterdam buiksloterham schoon schip de ceuvel and other bottomup community initiatives of offgrid circu lar construction became flagship projects of this circular business development strat egy they combined principles of sustainable living diy and waste material f savinirecovery these projects resulted in the first framework for circular building procure ment in municipality of amsterdam which set requirements for real estate developers to use at least of secondary materials in construction the con sultancy firms involved in these projects rapidly became frontrunners in policy consult ancy for city governments searching for solutions on how to reuse urban waste as close as possible to the source examples of these consultancy firms include metabolic and circle economy which today are active all over the country with more than employees each they connect circular economy principles with urban policymaking in order to devise solutions for the circular use of materials at urban and neighbor hood levels these initiatives trace the emergence of a finegrained market of microfirms that bridge design waste reuse research and policy the members of these firms inter viewed presents their work as the much needed alternative to the established trans national circuits of waste processing such as incineration landfilling or backfilling the sector is highly specialized with startups primarily looking at organic waste met als construction and demolition waste electronics and textiles because these types of waste can be more quickly reused in the urban consumers market organic and food waste is perhaps the most dynamic market and the one most frequently identified with ecoconsumption examples of initiatives that try to localize waste reuse are the com post stations for groups of at least five households and city neighborhoods warmhotel the multitude of caf ces that recover eatable food taste before you waste in stock resq club and the several neighborhoodbased textile and electronics reuse and repair initiatives lena clothing library the extent to which this emerging market of urban waste recovery will redirect waste streams from a global to a more local circuit is uncertain the steadily low recy cling rates of household waste in amsterdam show that the extent to which this market is actually reducing waste production is even more uncertain nonetheless the manner in which this market is evolving in amsterdam suggests that it may be an add itional parallel circuit of waste recovery to the international waste recovery and incin eration outlined above many rd activities in the sectors of bioplastics reused glass biochemicals d printing concrete smart crushing and recovered wood archi tecture are built on partnerships between consolidated waste processing companies and emerging startups the success of these firms in the five years between and was built around partnerships between governmental institutions logistic providers waste management companies and data companies around the notions of circularity in the city examples are the socalled city deals which are programmatic agreements sponsored by the national government to stimulate new partnerships between different productions the city deal circular city ie city deal circulaire stad was a milestone in the building of a national coalition of urban actors around strategies of waste recovery in cities with this deal nine city governments the ports of amsterdam and rotterdam and their numerous wasteprocessing industries built a nationwide coalition with startups in the lifecycle data and logistic sector to initiate a circular living lab in each city the exact boundaries of the urban circular economy in the amsterdam region today are difficult to delineate because this urban waste market is not separated to the existing circuits of waste management rather than a particular business sector the cir cular economy works rather as an overarching narrative to display anything that is considered sustainable green smart and social from the smallest bottomup socialjournal of environmental planning and management project to the largest waste recovery stream as a most recent evaluation of the circu lar economy market in the city of amsterdam shows the market of circular

cargo from social housing renewal cogreen and rehab to community supported agricul ture and smart food logistics pluk conclusions waste markets are central to circular economy programs realizing ambitions for the circular economy requires specific political economic and infrastructural changes that are set to occur in the waste sector in the coming years as a new paradigm of greeneconomic growth the circular economy taps into twenty years of transformation in thewaste market still while conceptual models of the circular economy are proliferating in the literature there is a dearth of detailed casebased empirical research looking at how waste markets are evolving in response to resource efficiency discourses inaddressing this gap this article gives a contextspecific empirical account of a particular case study the shifting political economy of waste markets in the netherlands the present study has shown that the waste sector is diversifying and integrating into other sectors of industrial production and urban consumption in order to establishinfrastructural and financial conditions for maximizing the economic value of wasteand residuals it has surveyed waste services altered financial composition shifting position in economic development and multiple geographies three waste sectors in particular seem especially central and dynamic in the netherlands

multinational local clusteringcityregional urban neighborhood f saviniservices to address ambitions for circular material recovery this industry has boosted its infrastructural and logistical capacities processing everlarger volumes of waste in more effective and profitable ways its financial composition results from the long term investments necessary to recover waste and the great economic risks involved indealing with secondary materials the sector is characterized by an increasing func tional integration of waste services in global utility services water energy logistics etc and a geographical clustering of these services in the industrial peripheries of cityregions while globalizing this sector is also becoming more capillary exploring ways of accessing specific waste streams in cities and further developing an integratedinfrastructure of waste logistics in urban areas the wte sector remains one of the most ambiguous and contingent components of circular economy programs on the one hand plans for the circular economy identify incineration as the least desirable mode of recovery on the other incinerators infra structural economic and geographical central position in the provision of energy andheat to cityregions allow this industry to undertake circular investments amsterdam s incinerator has positioned itself prominently in the city s transition toward a postfossil economy even though a large part of what is incinerated is of fossil origins initiating ventures in heating and energy provision it has diversified its operations to recover different types of urban waste that said the coupling of wte with other recoveryservices seems highly problematic and fragile circularity is also stimulating an alternative circuit of waste services the financial composition of this sector is based on startups and microagencies these position themselves economically as partners of and linkages between waste services and other urban investment sectors such as real estate food fashion and mobility theyalso link these sectors geographically connecting regional and national arenas of circu lar economy policy making with wastereuse practices in neighborhoods and cities policymakers welcome these practices as the beginning of an emerging form of urban circularity which can bring economic benefits and radically change the relationship between households and waste nonetheless as of yet it is unclear whether this sectorwill in fact indent the very source of waste in cities wasteful consumerism as such the three sectors analyzed in this paper show that ambitions for establishing circu larity are diversifying waste services as a means of increasing resource productivity from multiple waste streams in cityregions it seems though that these waste services are competing with each other for their key resource waste itself while converging toward a similar strategy of diversification of waste services herein lies the innate contradiction of the circular economy in which attempts to reduce consumption are subverted by the expansion of waste infrastructures which as this article notes depends on the volume and quality of residual streams if the ambition of circularity is to reduce waste altogether then realizing this would undermine these sectors financial and economic stability the challenge of future research on the circular economy is to move beyond concep tualization and examine how the doublesided relationship between waste reuse and waste reduction evolves this will make it possible to find manageable ways of imple menting ambitions for resource efficiency in waste services which is especially urgentwhen it comes to waste reduction in cityregions this paper s findings are limited by its geographical focus the netherlands and historical reach from to nevertheless it suggests two possible trajectories in the evolution of circular economy programs on the one hand if circular economy programs explicitly focus on reducingjournal of environmental planning and management waste flows then these sectors under study here will engage in fierce competition incin eration will progressively shrink and global waste recovery will localize in favor of localof waste reuse and reduction economies possibly built tackling wasteful consumerismon the other if circular policy programs stimulate a further expansion and diversification of waste services at large recovery incineration reuse etc then this market willlikely become even more dependent on processing an everincreasing supply of wastematerials as this paper has shown the economic and infrastructural configuration of thewaste recovery and wte sector demands a steady supply of waste this market is clearlyat odds with the more ecologically oriented
