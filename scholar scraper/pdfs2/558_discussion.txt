The results make it possible  to formulate  several  considerations  
that are useful in understanding  how to design policies  to promote  
the overall eﬃciency  and cost-effectiveness  of waste management  
systems  while meeting  environmental  objectives.  It is also essential  
to focus policies  on the sector’s  infrastructural  capacity  by select- 
ing and promoting  different  waste management  facilities  according  
to the current  situation.  
We have used a simulation  based on empirical  data to answer  
the proposed  RQs. First, in response  to RQ1, there is an imbalance  
in plant equipment  in the Italian regions,  and we calculate  this im- 
balance  for each plant type. Second,  in response  to RQ2, we esti- 
mate the economic  impact  of convergence  toward  the frontier  of 
eﬃciency.  Speciﬁcally,  the viability  of the investments  needed  to 
implement  an industrial  policy that involves  the reprogramming  of 
waste management  facilities  could be facilitated  by the potential  
savings  achieved  through  optimal  allocation  of plants. These an- 
swers to the research  questions  are highly signiﬁcant  because  we 
provide  useful evidence  for policymakers,  who can use our results 
to support  industrial  and environmental  policy to maximize  the ef- 
ﬁciency  of the waste management  system  and its compliance  with 
circular  economy  goals. 
In light of the results of our econometric  analysis,  it is appro- 
priate to consider  MBT, given its impact  on the cost of waste man- 
agement  services.  A 1% increase  in waste treated  by MBT facilities  
increases  the cost of the waste management  service  by €1.215 per
