in romania involves a new approach to ecological waste using basic concepts of circular economy to weigh accurately the proposed projects in this area taking into account existing environmental resources and zero waste objectives the paper is focused on quantitative and qualitative measures of waste prevention in romania the changing status of the waste by selling it as product the mechanisms for paying for treatment and or disposal which discourage waste generation and the use of financial resources obtained from secondary raw materials for the efficiency of waste management introduction according to executive director of the european environment agency hans bruyninckcircular economy concept has advanced in european policy decision as a positive perspectives based on solutions for achieving economic development while respecting environmental limits romanian european environment agency is ready to support the transition towards a circular economy through analyses and evaluations unlike traditional perspective of linear economy circular economy is trying to respect environmental limits by increasing distribution of renewable or recycled resources and reducing the consumption of raw materials and energy thus both the emissions and resources wasting will be reduced also concepts such as eco design distribution reuse repair recycling of products and materials will play an important role in maintaining the use and value of products components and materials it is essential to move to a circular economy in order to meet the resource efficiency agenda established under the europe strategy for smart sustainable and inclusive growth it can get higher performance and sustainable efficient use of resources which can bring major economic benefits in the industrial sector is already recognizes that improving resource productivity is a strong business case it is estimated that improving resource efficiency along the value chain could reduce material needs with by and a better use of resources should be a general potential saving of billion per year for european industry waste generation waste generation is highly dependent on local consumer habits the type of buildings general living conditions and the type of industry and commerce for example in areas with individual fireplaces with wood coal or coke waste is considerably more and denser in winter compared to buildings with th innovative manufacturing engineering and energy conference imanee iop publishing iop conf series materials science and engineering doix content from this

waste are very wet in the autumn time and has a hig h content of organic matter due to conservation of vegetables this can be problematic for waste incineration installations which may need additional fuel homes with a relatively low income produce less waste but more organic than homes with a relatively high income the single measurement of waste generation there is made by weighing platforms from the landfill recycling stations and treatment facilities with quality recording of waste type and transport origin based on these statistics there are recorded quarterly or seasonal waste variations and can do prognosis waste classification in terms of nature and places of production waste is classified as follows household waste waste from the household sector or other similar sectors including hazardous waste they contain and can be taken by our current precollection systems or villages collection systems street waste specific waste of public traffic routes from the daily activity of the population city green spaces animals deposition of solids in the atmosphere similar waste with municipal waste waste from small or large industry commerce public and administration sectors which presents similar composition and properties to household waste and can be collected transported processed and stored with them bulky waste solid waste from different sources which due to its size cannot be taken with the usual precollection or collection systems but requires a differentiated treatment construction waste waste from demolition of industrial and civil constructions hazardous waste toxic flammable explosive infectious waste or otherwise which after was introduced into the environment can harm plants animals or humans agricultural waste waste from agricultural and livestock units manure animal waste from slaughterhouses and meat industry industrial waste waste from technological processes hospital waste waste from the hospitals activities and health units which are incinerated in crematoria depending on specific local conditions could be other types of waste that requires special attention for example marine ballast polluted with oil chemicals and mining waste the main objectives of solid waste management the main objectives of solid waste management are protect public health protect the environment maintaining cleanliness in public for these places to be aesthetically acceptable conservation of natural resources through waste reduction policies and recycling all these objectives are achieved through a good collection and waste safe treatment a proper waste storage and disposal by my opinion integrated waste management is vital for the community for the following reasons the deposits capacity decreases continuously location and construction of new deposits is a difficult and expensive process many waste materials are rare natural sources imposing their recovery decreasing the environmental impact and increasing humans life quality the materials found in waste volume may be an opportunity to start a business a system that does not rely on one alternative is more flexible to economical technological and legislative changes the investors or creditors favour capital projects that are part of a carefully eco designed strategy local authorities are in an advantageous position in assessing the proposals for a new facility when they have the chance to thoroughly examine the entire system pollutant emissions from industry are very rich and very diverse in very vast area some principles are advanced only to reduce emissions of pollutants that need to be adapted for each industrial branch separately th innovative manufacturing engineering and energy conference imanee iop publishing iop conf series materials science and engineering doix industrial product life cycle stages life cycle approach means considering the environmental impacts and resources used throughout the lifecycle of products goods or services approaching life cycle helps us to identify sensitive points and aspects of a product which can be improved as lower environmental impact a reduced use of resources along the life cycle stages or compromises between different options on products sensitive issues can arise at any stage of the life cycle from raw material extraction and conversion and manufacturing and distribution to customer use and or consumption it ends with reuse recycling energy recovery and final disposal the key objective of lifecycle based approach is to contribute to decisions or express any managerial transfer of responsibility this means minimizing impacts on the environment in a life cycle stage or in a geographic region or a certain category of impacts while helping to avoid environmental impacts increase elsewhere for example saving energy during the use phase of a product without simultaneously increase the amount of material required for its delivery and impacts associated with this supply at each stage of the life cycle there are raw materials consumed and chemicals are released as emissions they contribute to different environmental impacts and issues like resource scarcity measures to reduce waste in order to achieve a circular economy in romania circular economy approaches exclude concept of waste and usually involve innovation along the value chain rather than rely on solely solutions for the life cycle end of a product for example these approaches may include reducing the amount of material required to provide a given service extending the useful product life cycle durability reducing the use of energy and materials within production of use phases efficiency reducing the use of hazardous materials or difficult to recycle into new products and production processes substitution the creation of markets for secondary raw materials based on standards and public acquisitions recycling designing products that are easily maintained repaired refurbished remanufactured or recycled ecodesign development of services that consumers need to reduce waste service maintenance repair etc stimulating and supporting the activities of waste reduction and quality separation made by consumers stimulating the separation and collection systems that minimize the costs of recycling and reuse facilitating group activities to prevent the transformation in waste of industrial products industrial symbiosis and encouraging the expansion and consumers choice improvement in this case the customer could use leasing and exchange of services as an alternative to holding of products we need to protect consumers interests in terms of cos t protection information contract terms issues related to insurance etc in order to show the relationship between industrial product lifecycle and industrial emissions i have realized a matrix named ecofriendly methods for reduction of industrial pollutant emissions industrial product life cycle stages matrix table according with luminia i popa and vasilenpopa the industrial product life cycle stages are the follows market needs research and development idea generation opportunity identification and concept definition research design and development prototype production distribution and manufacturing marketing sales maintenance service products feedback removal disposal as we can see in the matrix research and development and research design and development lifecycle stages have the highest score another two lifecycle stages prototype production and distribution and manufacturing have a high score in this case the industrial company managers have to take in consideration that these three metrics are very important because they could affect the entire industrial product life cycle also th innovative

stakeholders indicators are arranged in three groups lead dashboard and themespecific indicators for several indicators it is more meaningful to view the data at country level rather than at eu level the scoreboard by default presents the data for belgium the first country in the member states list sorted in protocol order data for the eu and other member states were selected from the country list eu indicators turning waste into a resource waste excluding major mineral wastes th innovative manufacturing engineering and energy conference imanee iop publishing iop conf series materials science and engineering doix the indicator shows trends in waste generation both euwide and for individual eu countries it covers both nonhazardous and hazardous waste from all sectors of the economy production households consumption it does not cover mineral wastes or soil over of these come from the mining and construction sectors which are subject to considerable fluctuation over time waste generation from which major mineral wastes are excluded reflects general trends more accurately than statistics on total waste generated the indicator shows the amount of waste generated annually in the eu as a whole and in individual countries expressed in kilos per inhabitant it is based on data collected in the way stimulated by the waste statistics regulation and is available for every second year as of reference year source  of wasteexcludingmajormineralwastes landfill rate of waste excluding major mineral wastes the indicator is defined as the volume of waste landfilled directly or indirectly in a country per year divided by the volume of the waste treated in the same year waste taken into account excludes major mineral wastes dredging spoils and contaminated soils this exclusion enhances comparability across countries as mineral waste accounts for high quantities in some countries due to economic activities such as mining and construction one exception however is that the indicator explicitly includes combustion wastes and solidified stabilised and vitrified wastes despite them being completely or partly mineral the indicator is derived from the twoyearly reporting of the countries according to the waste statistics regulation it covers landfilling of hazardous hz and nonhazardous nh waste from all economic sectors and from households including waste from waste treatment secondary wastesource  recycling rate of municipal waste the recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste divided by the total municipal waste arising recycling includes material recycling composting and anaerobic digestion municipal waste consists to a large extent of waste generated by households but may also include similar wastes generated by small businesses and public institutions and collected by the municipality this latter part of municipal waste may vary from municipality to municipality and from country to country depending on the local waste management system for areas not covered by a municipal waste collection scheme the amount of waste generated is estimated  electrical and electronic equipment waste weee weee poses on the one hand a risk to the environment hazardous components on the other hand it has a high potential for recycling to replace raw materials by secondary raw materials such as precious metals and other highly valuable special materials for the calculation of recycling rates it is crucial to know the volume of endoflife electrical and electronic equipment as this is for many devices and many countries difficult to deduct the volume of put on the market during the previous years considered as easier to deduct is considered as proxy for the volume of weee in the reference year see statements in article of the weeedirective eu the collection rate is calculated as the collected volume of weee in the reference year divided by the average sum of eee put on the market in the three previous years the recycling rate of e waste this indicator equals the total collection in the present year divided by the average of the put on the market of the three preceding years multiplied with the reuse and

pressures reducing drastically romanian economy dependence on imports which if gradual increases can become a source of national vulnerability increasing global competition for natural resources has contributed to increased prices and volatility also circular economy strategies applied could have as effect of reducing costs and increased competitiveness of romanian industry by net benefits which consist of job opportunities creating a circular economy in romania requires fundamental changes in the value chain from product design and production processes to new models of circularity business and consumption patterns in this manner recycling will turn waste into a resource and product life extension facility will contribute to reducing natural resources consumption th innovative manufacturing engineering and energy conference imanee iop publishing iop conf series materials science and engineering doix some romanian companies are already are experimenting new circularity business models such as those based on functions and services of collaborative consumption model specific for circular economy for the future romanian managers could take some measures for waste reduction the changing status of the waste by selling it as product the mechanisms for paying for treatment and or disposal which discourage waste generation the use of financial resources obtained from secondary raw materials for the efficiency of waste management
