Environmental sustainability Machine learningMunicipal solid waste MSW is one of the most urgent issues associated with economic growth and urban pop ulation When untreated it generates harmful and toxic substances spreading out into the soils When treated they produce an important amount of Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions directly contributing to global warming With its promising path to sustainability the Danish case is of high interest since estimated results are thought to bring useful information for policy purposes Here we exploit the most recent and available data period and investigate the causal relationship between MSW generation per capita income level urban ization and GHG emissions from the waste sector in Denmark We use an experiment based on Arti cial Neural

needs while allowing future generations to address their own Meanwhile the concept of Green Growth GG has emerged as a lowcarbon and climate compatible development pattern Challenges with Municipal Waste MW stands at the core of these comprehensive reforms since the effectiveness of the waste management sharply in u ences environmental quality One reason is that global material use is expected to double by with obvious dramatic consequences on human health and the environment OECD b When not treated ie abandoned or deposited in open dumps Municipal Solid Waste MSW generates harmful and toxic substances through its direct re lease into soilsLudwig et al Ali et al When treated ie collected and deposited in waste treatment facilities it produces an important amount of polluting emissions notably methane gasre sponsible for global warming IPCC Bogner et al Clarke et al Accordingly it has been underlined that MSW must be the subject of important expost management but also important ex ante regulations Ayalon et al In line with a sustainable path minimising waste through recovery or turning waste into energy are key areas in which circular business modelscan operate Malinauskaite et al DAdamo et al O E C D Facing this challenge the European Union EU Sixth Environment Action Programme listed waste reduction as one of its most urgent priorities Sjstrm and stblom Thus EU policies have been promoting sanitary land ll and waste recovery for a decade Sokka et al Das et al These global measures nd their or igin in a current concern the total quantity of MSW per capita increased by in the EU over the period Sjstrm and stblom And this trend holds also for Denmark where the per capita MSW increased by between and OECD a Looking at the per capita income this indicator recorded a growth over the same period WDI However the environmental costs related to MSW might still have decreased due to national waste man agement policies Indeed the Danish government has adopted several policy measures in parallel to the EUs effort reducing land lling in creasing processing for recycling and improving composting Andersen and Larsen As a result over the period municipal waste recovery increased from to composting in creased from to and land llingdecreased from to OECD a Danish households are also large food waste producers in Europe totalling t annually Kjr and Werge Hence in the Danish Ministry of the Environment established an Initia tive Group Against Food Waste composed of stakeholders from public and private sectors and aiming at achieving food waste reduction Halloran et al Finally wastetoenergy WTE processes have been strongly promoted across the territory through nonpro ts WTE plants owned by municipalities Tomi et al The effective im pact of these policies appears fruitful GHG emissions from the wastesector recorded a decrease over the period Denmark which has greatly exceeded the EU goals is even considered as one of the most advanced waste management systems making even extra income from the import and disposal of waste from neighbouring coun tries Tomi et al On the other hand the last OECD report on the environment ranked Denmark as the second largest MSW producer per capita among OECD countries after NewZealand With kg percapita this economy is well above the OECD average estimated at kg per capita As in most economies MSW generation continues to increase in Denmark it was stated at kg per capita in in dicating that this country has not yet managed to decouple waste gen eration from socioeconomic developments Facing such a burning environmental paradox the case of Denmark is of high interest Before designing any recommendations understanding the nature of the growthenvironmental degradation relationship is mandatory Arst strand of the literature examined the determinants of MSW gen eration at various levels Johnstone and Labonne Karousakis Chalak et al Upon the identi ed key drivers the role of in come turned out to be considerable but sensitive to the countrys stage of development Liu and Wu Evidence of a progressive de linking process in advanced economies has been early noted by the OECD In theory such decoupling phenomenon may occur when the elasticity of the MSW generation indicator in relation to per capita in come is positive but less than unity relative delinking before becom ing negative absolute delinking Mazzanti Only in that case does income cease to be a robust driver to environmental degradation In practice its empirical assessment has been made using the well known Environmental Kuznets Curve EKC approach Kuznets Grossman and Krueger While many times documented in the literature generalizing the inverted Ushaped curve for highincome countries is still con icting This is notably due to the variety of meth odologies employed and sample selected calling for further inquiry into the wasteincome nexus using a more consistent empirical strategy A second branch of the literature is constituted of studies relying on the EKC framework to investigate the link between economic growth and environmental pollution Grossman and Krueger Sarkodie and Strezov Stern and Common Bilgili et al Since sectoral analyses have taken a growing place in this research eld a few published works explored the determinants of GHG emissions from the waste sector inducing worthwhile policy implications Lee et al Dong et al In practice the waste sector is said to have high potential in curbing environmental pollution despite an im portant carbon footprint Yi et al Hence numerous strategies for GHG abatement in the waste sector have been proposed at different locations land ll extension and energy recovery system for waste dis posal Woon and Lo Hong Kong China higher energy recovery notably land ll gas ef ciency from waste incineration for combined heat and power generation Yang et al for China Yi et al for Daejeon Korea Food waste treatment including thermal treat ment compost and anaerobic digestion Bernstad and Jansen for Sweden Nonetheless an indepth review of the literature highlights that none of these studies examined the relationship among MSW genera tion income and GHG emissions within a single frameworkYet it is known that a neighbouring assessment on the interrelationshipsMainly chlorinated solvents heavy metals polycyclic aromatic and aromatic hydro carbons and vinyl chlorides According to the World Resource Institute WRI methane gas represents of the total GHG emissions and is also the main contributor to GHG emissions in the wastesector The OECD de nes a circular economy as a system which maximises the value of the materials and products that circulate within the economy Allowing for sharp resources preservation and environmental footprint reduction circular business modelsare attracting a growing attention from researchers governments and industries For anindepth assessment on the potential of waste recovery and wastetoenergy under a circular economy environment in Europe see Malinauskaite et al MSW generation per capita increased from kg per capita to kg per capita over the period OECD a In fact waste is taxed in Denmark to promote recycling over the waste incineration and land lling Tomi et al By contrast land lling remains the main waste disposal method in OECD countries indicating a considerable step in the sustainable direction for Denmark OECD cGHG emissions from the waste sector recorded a decrease from to thousand tonnes of CO equivalent over the period OECD b For instance Mazzanti and Zoboli andMazzanti carried an empirical analysis on EU countries and concluded that estimated waste elasticities were far fromconrming the EKC hypothesis Similarly Cole et al found no turning point for OECD countries In fact Lee et al andMagazzino et al a estimated two distinct models for the US and Switzerland respectively In the rst model they assessed the link among per capita GDP and MSW generation and in the second model they explored the relationship between total MSW recovery waste generation and GHG emissions from the wastesectorC Magazzino M Mele N Schneider et al Science of the Total Environment among energy consumption Gross Domestic Product GDP and CO emissions has been extensively performedLozano and Gutierrez Magazzino Magazzino and Cerulli Sarkodie Being of central importance in growth theory and providing far reaching policy implications linking wasteGDP and GDP environmental pollution data in a unique estimation model can repre sent a fruitful research direction If it is con rmed that GHG emissions from the waste sector are both driven by per capita MSW and income then focusing on these key factors would help policymakers mitigating global warming Reciprocally if income is identi ed as the main deter minant of waste generation then adequate measures can be imple mented Accordingly this is where our paper nds the rst of its ve contributions Looking with closer scrutiny most published works have focused on large groups of advanced economies EU OECD including often hetero geneous panel members in a single estimation Due to the wellknown waste data constraintit is not clear that the results obtained based on wide income groups can be generalized for each member Besides OECD and EU datasets may differ depending on the national waste clas sications Johnstone and Labonne Yet the knowledge on MSW with readily available waste statistics allow for singlecountry analysisWhile never studied in previous research analysing the waste sector in Denmark stands as the second contribution of the pres ent work Third studies on the waste sector remain sporadic and limited de spite its signi cant global warming contributor The Sustainable devel opment goal accentuates the importance of sustainable production and consumption United Nations hence a part of the debate on Sustainable Development SD should focus on waste management Accordingly this paper follows Domingos et al and contributes to the literature in analysing the waste sector A fourth novelty aspect is methodological This research relies on a Machine Learning ML methodology through the Arti cial Neural Net works ANNs Our empirical approach differs from the great majority of existing analyses on this topic Nonetheless the few studies that used ML models on waste data failed to include additional variables within a multivariate predictive causality framework Kannangara et al Meza et al Pan et al Beyond a simple fore casting purpose the present study relies on an innovative algorithm to perform a strong causal analysis among multiple variables Finally urbanization is included as an additional explanatory factor to land and air degradation This last original aspect is based on the household utility maximization proposed by Kinnaman and Fullerton The authors identi ed a vector of demographic characteristics towards which the use of household MSW is dependent and notably the fact to live in urban areas or not Then Johnstone and Labonne adapted this model with macroeconomic data to assess the de terminants of MSW generation for OECD countries To do so they rely on the proportion of the urban population A more urbanized pop ulation is said to exert growing pressure on urban resources and envi ronment Kasman and Duman Magazzino and Cerulli Undoubtedly this factor is thought to be a nonnegligible driver of MSW generation and GHG emissions Hence there is a point in incorpo rating it within our frameworkOverall this paper aims at performing an indepth assessment on Denmark a case study characterized by a promising but fragile path to MSW sustainability With ve distinct novelty aspects this research seeks to contribute to the literature We exploit the most recent and available data period and investigate the causal relation ship between per capita GDP urbanization MSW generation per capita and GHG emissions from the waste sector in Denmark FollowingMagazzino et al a this study applies two independent empirical strategies a timeseries analysis the BreitungCandelon Spectral Grangercausality test and a Machine Learning approach Arti cial Neural Networks experiments useful for policy formulation Besides this introduction the remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section presents the literature Section introduces and de scribes the data and methodology employed Section shows the em pirical results and discussion of the results Finally Section provides concluding remarks and careful policy recommendations Literature review The literature on the relationship between economic activity and en vironmental degradation can be divided into two main components Therst focuses on the economic growthenvironmental pollution nexus mainly carbon dioxide CO emissions The second concen trates on the link between economic growth and land degradation ie waste generation In the third part this review highlights studies on green supply processes and a speci c focus is made on waste treat ment within circular models Being nonetheless exhaustive this survey emphasizes the suitability of assessing the Danish case and shed light on the key gaps in the literature Economic growthenvironmental pollution nexus As mentioned previously the relationship between economic activ ity and environmental pollution has been abundantly studied using the EKC framework The origins of this assessment can be traced back to the seminal study from Grossman and Krueger When con rmed this hypothesis claims that environmental pollution would rst increase with income and then decreases as GDP grows and technological prog ress emerges Rothman and De Bruyn Lee et al From a policy standpoint it is of high interest to know what relation character izes the GDPCO emissions nexus for a country Magazzino and Cerulli Despite abundant empirical examinations studies differ from each other in terms of methodologies time periods and samples Acaravci and Ozturk Bowden and Payne Bilgili et al This review focuses on our country of interest Denmark Since the economic growthwaste generation nexus is the explicit aim ofthis paper we select the only relevant information related to previous GDPenvironmental pollution investigations Nonetheless an extensive overview can be found in Bilgili et al The EKC is validated in Acaravci and Ozturk for European EU countries including Denmark and using Autoregressive Distrib uted Lag ARDL bounds cointegration analysis Pesaran and Shin Pesaran et al and Error Correction Model ECM Subse quently the EKC is supported in Ben Jebli et al for OECD Or ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries including Denmark While results provided little evidence supporting the existence of the EKC hypothesis for Artic countries Baek Bilgili et al conrmed the EKC hypothesis for OECD countries including Denmark through Fully Modi ed Ordinary Least Squares FMOLS and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares DOLS estimations Overall despite not explicitly providing support for the EKC hypothesis Saidi and Hammami showed that CO emissions have a strongOutside the waste framework the empirical relationship between GDP CO emissions and various sources of energy has been extensively tested See Pao and Tsai Tiwari Farhani and Ben Rejeb Magazzino Kasman and Duman Munir et al for the relevant literature on this topic which is not the explicit aim of this paper The literature lacks singlecountry case studies mainly because of the data constraint Waste classi cations may vary across countries and care must be taken when working with data reported before the s For an interesting discussion on the data quality issuerelated to the waste sector see Mazzanti et al Beforehand Mazzanti used the information available at that time and investi gated the wasteGDP nexus for EU countries Due to a timelimited dataset the authors stated that his research would only provide preliminary evi dence Hence the current available statistics allow us to make a step forward hereBroad critical surveys are also presented in Dasgupta et al Dinda a n d Stern C Magazzino M Mele N Schneider et al Science of the Total Environment negative impact on per capita GDP for countries including Denmark Inversely the EKC hypothesis is rejected in Shaei and Salim for OECD countries including Denmark while using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population Af uence and Technology STIRPAT model As in Bee and Kalayci who applied ARDL GC and TodaYamamoto TY Toda and Yamamoto c a u s a l i t y tests the EKC is rejected for Denmark Spain and the United Kingdom Focusing on a neighbouring research issue Silva et al applied Impulse Response Function IRF models and showed that income and COemissions variables are overly sensitive to changes in the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix for Denmark Despite not conrming the EKC hypothesis such results underline the persisting linkages among energy income and pollution Overall previous re search demonstrated that extracting renewable fuel from MSW helps to reduce GHG emissions from the waste sector in the EU Domingos et al Table summarizes the main information of the empirical EKC literature Municipal solid wasteincome nexus MSW is a major component of total waste generation and is obvi ously linked to land degradation Hence the EKC framework has been extensively employed to inspect per capita MSWGDP relationship Nevertheless incomeland degradation nexus remains under investigated As for GDPCO studies the Danish case appears only con sidered through multicountry examinations so far Therst strand of studies explored the determinants of MSW gener ation underlining the key role played by income in MSW generation The seminal contribution from Johnstone and Labonne focused on OECD countries including Denmark and investigated the macro economic determinants of household solid waste generation Applying panel estimation over the period the results clearly showed that economic activity and population density are two robust drivers of solid waste This nding is in line with Karousakis who per formed a neighbouring examination including a waste legislation index on the same sample Empirical results showed that MSW in creases linearly with income While the timeinvariant policy index is not signi cant urbanization displayed an even stronger effect on waste generation Other research works extended this examinationand con rmed explicitly the existence of a turning point between in come and waste Arbul et al explored the effects of tourism notably expenditure per tourist on MSW generation in EU coun tries including Denmark over the period The authors pro vided tools for tourism management policies and supported the existence of the EKC curve between MSW and income However other studies failed to con rm the existence of the EKC be tween waste and income Cole et al collected data on OECDcountries including Denmark to examine the relationship between per capita income and a wide range of environmental indicators nitro gen dioxide carbon dioxide methane and municipal waste Results of the panel analysis failed to support the EKC relationship indicating no existing turning point This is in line with Mazzanti and Zoboli who considered EU countries including Denmark and examined the wasteincome relationship over the period but rejected the EKC Subsequently Mazzanti estimated waste elasticities with respect to income for EU countries including Denmark Exploiting data over the period results rejected the exis tence of hypothetical turning point among variables Overall Mazzanti and Zoboli extended their analysis to EU countries including Denmark and found no delinking process between nal consumption household expenditure and waste generation per capita although elas ticity to income drivers appeared lower than in their previous study Baalbaki and Marrouch examined the relationship between MSW and GDP per capita for OECD countries including Denmark The authors employed Wang sexible polynomial model with data spanning the period Despite evidence of a downward sloping relationship among variables the results rejected the EKC hy pothesis Table summarizes the main information of this literature Green logistics indicatorsenvironmental degradation nexus studies and waste management within circular business models Logistic management is a crucial part of the supply chain manage ment This refers to a set of integrated actions improving inventory stor age material handling freight transport and information processing Martel and Klibi Even though logistics is known as a signi cant contributor to economic growth its interlinkages with environmental degradation remain ambiguous and underestimated The seminal study from Khan et al shed light on an original prospect carbon emissions may also affect adversely economic growth As awareness be comes stronger customers are more conscious regarding green prod ucts and sustainability with governments being more aggressive to implement environmental policies Interestingly customer pressure can impact the rms adoption of green supply chain management GSCM practices Khan et al Hence speci c literature linking green logistic operations and economic and environmental indicators have emerged Khan et al considered different economies including Denmark and claimed that logistics operations deplete en ergy and fossil fuel while the amount of fossil fuel and nongreen en ergy sources has a substantial adverse impact on the sustainability of the atmosphere With a special focus on emerging Asian countries Khan et al showed that logistics operations especially the ef ciency of customs clearance processes the quality of logistics services and traderelated infrastructure positively impact per capita income valueadded manufacturing and trade openness Nevertheless greater logistics activities are negatively associated with social and environ mental issues including climate change global warming carbon pollu tion and ozone poisoningBy contrast some singlecountry analyses on neighbouring countries are available For as p e c i c assessment in Switzerland see Jaligot and Chenal andMagazzino et al a Evidence for the US case are provided in Lee et al Table Summary of previous studies on the relationship between GDP and CO emissions including Denmark Source our elaborations Authors Countries Sample period

Schneider et al Science of the Total Environment Far from being a coincidence the nature of MSW disposal plays a leading role in the path to sustainability This allows for sharp resources preservation and environmental footprint reduction circular business models coincide with waste treatment operations OECD Thus interesting literature is emerging underlining the potential of waste re covery for the circular economy Nonetheless DAdamo et al ar gued that the economic feasibility of such a model is con rmed for a few scenarios only in Italy Focusing on the transport sector the authors con cluded that the use of green gas is capable of reducing GHG emissions but the economic cost of the environmental externality ie cer ticates of emission of biofuel in consumption CIC remains lower than the value released by the current Italian decree ie CIC Van Fan et al proposed an integrated design of waste manage ment systems under a circular environment using Pgraph bipartite graphical optimisation tool The authors showed that each ton of MSW processed could avoid kg of GHG emissions expressed in COequivalent besides it could achieve an estimated pro to f ton of MSW treated Looking at the case of Croatia Luttenberger built a relevant review on national waste policies and provided careful measures to strengthen Croatias path towards a circular economy Based on this review an indepth assessment on the Danish case mayll a crucial gap in the literature while presenting accurate ndings useful for researchers and policymakers Hence this paper investigates the causal relationship between per capita GDP MSW generation per capita and GHG emissions from the waste sector in Denmark Following Magazzino et al a a novel timeseries analysis coupled with a Machine Learning approach is utilized Data collection and empirical strategy Data collection To implement our model we derived the following data for Denmark Total Municipal Solid Waste Generation TMWG i s expressed in kilograms per capita per capita GDP GDPp i se x p r e s s e d in Purchasing Power Parity PPP constant international GHG emissions from the waste sector are expressed in thousand tonnes of COequivalent GGWS As a proxy for urbanization we use urban pop ulation expressed in of total population Urban TMWG and GGWS are taken from the OECD Environment Statistics databaseGDPp and Urban data are derived from the World Development Indicators databaseAccording to the OECD MSW indicator correspondsto the total waste collected by or on behalf of the municipalities It incor porates waste originating from households and small commercial activ ities GHG emissions are constituted of carbon dioxide CO from energy use and industrial processes and methane emissions that are produced by the waste sector OECD b The data cover the period The choice of the starting period was constrained by waste and GHG emissions data availability often missing or unavailable before for most of the advanced economies Empirical methodology The causality relationship expressed in econometric modeling is now tested through the ANNs approach According to Pearl andKocaoglu et al we develop Feedforward Neural Networks as a Structural Causal Models SCMs to verify how in a predictive way TMWG GDPp a n d Urban cause GGWS in Denmark ANNs are made up of elementary computational units neurons known as Processing Units PU Neurons are combined according to different architectures for example they can be organized in layers multilayer network or they can have a topology in which each neu ron is connected to all the others fully connected network We mainly refer to layered networks consisting of the input layer with nneurons equal to the number of network inputs the hidden layer with one or more hidden or intermediate layers consisting of mneurons the out put layer with pneurons equal to the number of desired outputs The connection methods allow us to distinguish between two types of archi tectures In feedback architectures the presence of connections be tween neurons of the same layer or between neurons of the previous layer creates a feedback connection In feedforward architectures the connections between the levels are interconnected and do not generate minimum levels Thus the signal is transmitted only to neurons belong ing to the next layer McCulloch and Pitts proposed the repre sentation of the ANNs reported in Fig Each neuron receives ninput signals from the other neurons the vector x through connections of intensity wsynaptic weights The input signals are consolidated into a postsynaptic potential y which is the weighted sum of the inputs The sum function thus calculates the activation value which is then transformed into the output Fyb ya n appropriate transfer or activation function Neurons in the input layer have no input Their activation status corresponds to the data input to the network They do not perform any calculation and the activation function transfers the input value to the network without changing it The operational capacity of a network ie its knowledge is contained in the synapses ie the weights of the input connections of each neuron The latter assumes the correct values thanks to training The NNs are not directly programmed but explicitly trained through a learning algo rithm to solve a given task with a process that leads to learning throughPer capita MSW generation and GHG emissions from the waste sector data are avail able at  Per capita GDP and urban population data are available at

and reinforcement In the case of unsupervised learning the network is trained only on an input set without providing the corresponding output set For supervised learning however it is necessary to identify a set of examples consisting of appropriate sam ples of the inputs and the corresponding outputs to be presented to the network so that it learns to represent them Finally reinforcement learning is used in cases where it is not possible to specify input output patterns for supervised learning systems Reinforcement is pro vided to the system which interprets it as a positivenegative signal on its behaviour adjusting the parameters accordingly The set of con gurations used for learning the network constitutes the learning set called the training set Basically we adopted an empirical strategy sim ilar to Magazzino et al a b c a n d Mele and Magazzino In the following analysis we consider more complex ANNs than the one in Fig Our ANN design has a multilayer structure feedforward multilayer multilayer perceptron and it is de ned by Minput nodes lacking the capacity for processing associated with inputs xiR a set of neurons organized in L layers of which L hidden layers and an exit layer which provides the outputs network yi a set of oriented and weighted arches that establish connections The functions that rep resent the ANNs can be expressed as ajM iwjixij

generated the rst differences d and the logarithm ln of the series This procedure al lows us to grasp the variation between the data of the same variable in a context that of ML in which the timeseries loses importance Our algorithm constructed through the extension of the Oryx protocol use a combination of data equal to They represent all the possible inputtarget combinations necessary to generate the neural processing process that generates the nal target Subsequently after building the neural process we will proceed by testing the results ob tained through the latest testing techniques on NN models After applying the ANN algorithm we access the hypothesis that Denmark is on the verge of achieving a circular economy a situation where waste and pollution is eliminated through recycling reusing and regeneration of natural resource capital To test this we utilize re gression to examine the nexus variable importance of projection to in vestigate the impact of income

derivatives Instead the QuasiNewton method computes an approximation of the inverse Hessian at each iteration of the algorithm by only using gradient information Fig shows the training and selection errors in each iteration The blue line represents the training error while the orange one is the selec tion error The initial value of the training error is and its nal value after epochs is The initial value of the selection error is and its nal value after epochs is The downward trend of both error assessments highlights how our strategy turned out to be ideal for the ANNs elaboration process Next we run the Per formed Order Selection POS test The best selection is achieved by using a model whose complexity is the most appropriate to produce an adequate t of the data The order selection algorithm is responsible fornding the optimal number of neurons in the network Incremental order is used here as an order selection algorithm in the model selec tion Fig shows the errors history for the different subsets during the incremental order selection process The blue line shows the train ing error while the orange line symbolizes the selection error Both the training error and the selection error decrease with increas ing order Only at order number we observe a minimal increase in the output error In this level the training error is only while the selec tion error is This result highlights the presence of a betterhidden architecture It presents even lower algorithm errors than our initial architecture Thus following the ML process in Fig we elaborated thenal architecture of the ANN Fig represents the result of our elaboration considering the nd ings achieved with the POS test The number of inputs is and thenumber of outputs is The complexity represented by the numbers of hidden neurons is Therefore compared to Fig this ANNs presents an automatic choice that has reduced the third hidden layer of a neuron Afterwards we test the nal architecture through different operations A standard method to test the loss of a model is to perform a linear regression analysis between the scaled ANNs outputs and the cor responding targets for an independent testing subset As observed in Fig the prediction line with respect to the target GGWS perfectly con rms the goodness of the elaboration about the al gorithm on the nal architecture As required by theory the slope of the straight line records a value close to unity the correlation value is very high Finally we proceed with the ANNs error test Table G to ascertain the goodness of t test of this algorithm It analyzes the result of four dif ferent errors concerning the three main instances of the NN model Table analyzes four possible scenarios of prediction errors concerning training selection and testing For ANNs theory values from training to testing should be gradually lower and lower than unity The results obtained fully con rm the theory of this test All the errors of the three main components of the ANNs are less than one Be sides it is clear how the training errors are lower than the selection er rors which are lower than the testing errors This test con rms how the latest architecture of the ANNs respects the hypothesis of the slightest prediction error and that our generated target is correctly affected by the in uence of the numerous combinations between the inputs

Environment predictors on GHG from waste sector It can be observed in Fig that total municipal waste generation income level and urban population have a negative relationship with waste sector attributed GHG with a predictive power between and and strength of correlation be tween to This con rms the hypothesis that Denmark is on the verge of achieving a circular economy meaning that while urban population increases with growth in income and levels of munic ipal waste generated waste sector attributed GHG emissions decline periodically In terms of variable in uence in reducing GHG emissions it can be observed from the variable importance of projection plot that while urban population is highly in uential VIP municipal waste generation and income level are moderately in uential VIP thus corroborating both estimated Pearsons correla tion and RsquareEvidence from BreitungCandelon Spectral Grangercausality test in Fig reveals that the null hypothesis of no predictability from urban population to GHG from waste sector and municipal waste generation to GHG from waste sector is rejected at signi cance level We ob serve that among all odds urban population has a strong unidirectional causality along the entire frequency range compared to municipal waste generation that turns insigni cant between frequency range In contrast we nd no causality from urban population to munic ipal waste generation income level to municipal waste generation and income level to GHG from waste sector From a policy perspective it ap pears that urbanization has a mitigation effect on waste sector attrib uted GHG emissions which might perhaps be due to Denmarks urban waste management options that underscore recycling reusing and ef cient conversion of wastetoenergy Previously waste generation in Denmark had strong positive monotonic associated with economic de velopment and emissions which supported the traditional linear econ omy Mstdk However our empirical estimation con rms a drift from linear economy to circular economy This implies that the Danish government is implementing conservation and management policies that favour environmental sustainability Finally we report the result of the predictive causality effect from the inputs to the target This result highlights three possible variations of the target position velocity and acceleration The three variables

the emissions from waste are accelerated by the quantity of municipal solid waste products in the country under study However we note that this accel eration would represent a linear transition from urban growth to thechange in per capita GDP towards waste production We can also inter pret these results by weighing the role of the change in per capita GDP compared to the urban increase The variable of which represents eco nomic growth in a highincome country such as Denmark generates a more signi cant effect in the production of waste and emissions com pared to a hypothetical growth of the population If the transition be tween speed and acceleration towards the target passes from economic growth to waste production the increase in the demand for goods and services of the population is directly a consequence of the emissions target Besides the changes in target acceleration is predic tively caused by the change in speed and acceleration of the Municipal solid waste Therefore a separate waste collection policy would gener ate a change in the decrease in the acceleration of the target and thus in emissions The effects of such an economic waste management policy Fig

up to the economic market By purchasing the raw material produced by users plastic metal glass the materials could be used in a retransformation cycle Therefore they will create new products in the economic system In this way users are not pushed and throw waste onto the street for which they are remunerated Finally we tested our NN algorithm in the process that generates dif ferent alternative

algorithm better than the one used in this study Conclusion and policy implications This paper presented the rst evidence on the causal relationship be tween MSW generation per capita per capita GDP urbanization and GHG emissions from the waste sector in Denmark We exploited the most recent and available data period and a very current estimate model based on Arti cial Neural Networks and Breitung Candelon Spectral Grangercausality In contrast to traditional statistic or econometric techniques we employed sophisticated mathematical methods since they better penetrate the laws of the environment I n fact after processing the data through numerous combinations in the socalled learning phase our Neural Network proposed a linearization of the problem which we solved using a mathematical formula that binds the different ones together variables Our Neural Network re quired a double construction to choose autonomously through the In cremental Order Test the best input neurons capable of generating thenal signal to the selected target This procedure con rmed by the most sophisticated Machine Learning tests allowed us to obtain a neu ral network from which we observed how GHG emissions from the waste sector in Denmark undergo variations based on the economic trend of the Total Municipal Solid Waste Generation from the proxy for urbanization and GDP per capita The results showed how the vari ance of per capita GDP represents the variable that can accelerate emis sions from waste Our results obtained from the analysis of neural networks could be interpreted as a couplingdecoupling relationship between economic growth and management of waste that causes harmful emissions In deed a greater wealth that certainly translates into a higher amount of waste generated is associated with a reduction of emissions from the waste sector Similarly our time series model corroborated these ndings and found a signi cant negative monotonic relationship be tween waste sector GHG emissions income urbanization and municipal waste generation In line with that the BreitungCandelon Spectral Grangercausality supports the existence of a unidirectional causal link from urban population and municipal waste to waste emissions Bring ing high value information our timeseries ndings con rmed logically the results of the machine learning approach Hence an accurate inter pretation of them is required to design consistent policy measures In a given economy the amount of waste generated is effectively linked to the level of income and thus wealth However it has also been shown that such relation can be nonlinear As income grows over time recycling composting and incinerating processes may re place standard land lls As a matter of fact a delinking relationship among wealth and waste may emerge with major positive effects on the environmental quality Since Denmark displays one of the worlds highest income per capita this economy may have reached a turning point of economic development after which wealth enhances waste generation while it reduces emissions from the waste sector Accord ingly it is a relevant perspective for policy making at a national scale as the nationspeci c waste situation is a crucial issue in Europe First reducing the costs and improving the effectiveness of major waste treatment policies is necessary This concerns phasing out from land ll strategies but also developing hightech waste inciner ation and recycling processes across the Danish territory Because the proportion of urban population is decidedly linked to waste generation and emissions in Denmark speci c attention should be drawn to densely populated areas where waste management is at the heart of environmental concerns but also the core of solutions Second lowering the generation of waste at its source should explicitly be pursued since strengthening the waste management in the postproduction phase is not suf cient Thus waste policy efforts should focus on changing agents behaviour and rms decisions at the level of waste production Otherwise an increasing gap will emerge between the policy objectiveslowing down climate change and land use degradation in Denmark and its effective implementation uncontrolled polluting emissions from the Danish waste sector Opening to an international prospect our results would represent policy advice based on a global policy that sees wealth as the solution to waste emissions Obviously investments in waste management are functions of the economic and social capacity of the country but alsoon its willingness to achieve environmental targets While logical for such an advanced economy like Denmark other developing countries face chronic dif culties in managing waste because of a crucial lack of nancial capacity and public infrastructures devoted to this issue There fore future studies should examine the wealthwasteemissions nexus in developing countries if data availability allows that Since numerous urban areas display critical levels of untreated and polluting waste re searchers should identify the conditions under which a cuttingedge waste chain may be implemented in low and middle income coun tries But rst and foremost promoting adequate waste management practices would substantially help turning these cities towards a sus tainable path CRediT authorship contribution statement
