Integral Circular Economy Report 2023 Assessment for the Netherlands,18-04-2023,"Every two years, the Integral Circular Economy Report (ICER) provides an overview of the status of the desired transition towards a circular economy in the Netherlands. PBL is producing this report at the request of the Dutch Government and in cooperation with other Dutch knowledge institutions."
Plastic futures and their CO2 emissions,07-12-2022,"A circular bioeconomy can dramatically rein in the fast-growing plastic sector’s climate, pollution, and resource consumption impacts. Under current policies, global plastic production will likely triple by the year 2100. Today, the plastic sector is responsible for almost 5% of all greenhouse gas emissions. By providing a circular, bio-based plastic industry with emissions-free electricity, and by avoiding waste incineration, the sector may even grow to become a form of carbon sink.
	That is the conclusion of an article in the journal Nature, published recently by researchers from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), Utrecht University, the Netherlands Association for Sustainable Energy (NVDE) and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)."
Addressing international impacts of the Dutch circular economy transition,09-05-2022,"The Netherlands has the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. This policy brief discusses the risks and opportunities of the Dutch circular economy transition for low- and middle-income countries that are connected to the Dutch economy through international supply chains. The conclusions are relevant not only for Dutch circular economy policy, but also for development cooperation in which achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is central."
Circular Economy Progress Report 2022,14-04-2022,"This Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 provides an update of the progress and transition towards a circular economy. It builds on the conclusions published by PBL in January 2021 in the Integral Circular Economy Report (ICER 2021). A number of indicators from the ICER monitoring framework have been updated, for this purpose. In addition, this progress report looks more closely at the possible role of the circular economy in tackling the various challenges within the human environment."
Possible objectives for a circular economy,17-12-2021,"At the request of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, PBL identifies possible objectives for a circular economy. Changes in the way raw materials are used may contribute substantially to solving various major social issues, such as the impact of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution of air, water and soil, and supply risks related to raw materials."
Potential effects of Dutch circular economy strategies on low- and middle-income countries: Cotton production and post-consumer textiles,18-11-2021,"The Netherlands has the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. At the request of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we explore what such a transition could mean for low- and middle-income countries that are connected to the Netherlands through international value chains. In this report, we focus on textiles. More specifically, we examine cotton production in West Africa and post-consumer textiles processing in Pakistan."
Extended Producer Responsibility,09-07-2021,"Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a widely used policy to support the transition to a circular economy in the European Union. In these two reports, PBL and CPB analyse the design, functioning and effects of EPR, based on a survey of the literature and on case studies on batteries, end-of-life vehicles and medicines in the Netherlands."
Potential effects of Dutch circular economy strategies on low- and middle-income countries: the case of electrical and electronic equipment,19-02-2021,"The Netherlands has the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. In this report, we analyse what such a transition could mean for low- and middle-income countries that are connected to the Netherlands through international value chains, focusing on transboundary trade in discarded electrical and electronic equipment. We identify conditions for positive impact and discuss opportunities, risks and dilemmas. This study is part of a broader project that analyses transboundary effects of the circular economy transition in the Netherlands."
International Workshop on Targets for a Circular Economy - summary,24-02-2020,"In preparation for The Annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in January 2020, PBL Netherlands and Utrecht University, in consultation with PACE, organized an international workshop on targets for a circular economy on the 17th of January 2020."
Outline of the circular economy,29-05-2019,"In many countries, governments are looking for ways to change their economy into one that is circular, or to improve the level of resource efficiency (e.g. see the EU programme ‘Closing the loop’ or the World Circular Economy Forum). To do so effectively, having an overview of the current state of circular activities in the economy is important. To date, such an overview has been lacking. This PBL report provides an outline of the current state of the circular economy in the Netherlands."
