 Management Research Vol The Authors Article reuse guidelines sagepubcomjournalspermissions DOI X journalssagepubcomhomewmr Tourism industry is strongly connected with economic growth and urban development especially in coastal areas In particular the total European Union EU coastal holiday business was appraised at a Gross Value Added of bln that is close to onethird of its total maritime economy while the total employ ment is almost mln fulltime equivalent jobs In Europe alone with more than mln arrivals per year the tourism industry represents nearly mln direct jobs within mln enterprises with the direct turnover to be around bln per year On the other hand tourist development disturbs the metabolism of tour ist areas mainly due to waste generation use of local resources and numerous elements of infrastructure that must be constructed and operated most commonly during the summer months to cover tourists needs Unfortunately existing data are scarce and mostly based on tourism industry as a whole lacking a destinationbased focus at this point that would highlight the adverse environmental effects imparted on specific tourism areas Overall besides the economic advantages there is strong evi dence that tourist activities also add significant pressures on the environment Among them waste generation is one of the most important as it translates into a larger environmental footprint and extreme environmental pressures especially on coastal areas eco systems mainly in the form of pollution and subsequent loss of biodiversity discouraging others from traveling to such impacted destinations This is further intensified by overtourism a vital clear and present challenge in many locations around the globe increasing massively the pressure on many ecosystems As an example if no actions are taken by the key tourism stakeholders soon enough the weight of plastics that end up in our seas is estimated to be much higher than the weight of fish over the next decades Furthermore it is estimated that the global amount of solid waste generated by tourism enterprises is more than mil lion tonnes annually In general tourists could produce up to twice as much solid waste per capita as local populations and waste from accommodation has similar features to mixed household waste being composed of a miscellaneous mix of materials counting mainly organics ie food waste as well as hazardous materials sanitary batteries etc that can create noteworthy environmental impacts upon disposal particularly through Green Houses Gas GHG emissions and leaching of toxic materials It is estimated that hotels create about kg of unsorted waste per guest per night The major waste fractions produced by hotels are organic plastics glass cardboard and paper metals green waste and others It is noted that organics originate mainly from food and beverage activities for example preparing breakfast and meals for inhouse restaurants It should be noted again that destinationspecific data and data from complete thorough and integrated case studies are presently lacking Nowadays a circular economy CE strategy along with the United Nations UN sustainable development goals SDGs agenda the EU Green Deal and the United States of America USA Green New Deal are gaining momentum as a means to combat climate change and contribute to environmental sustainability by tackling waste as a resource on a global scale A new mindset to boost circular business models in the tourism industry seems to be a necessary step forward to improve environmental performance while at the same time generate cost savings and growth of revenue and also help create new local jobs This step forward approach should be based on the adoption of Environmental Management Systems EMS principles as well as on the adoption of initiatives based on R strategies eg reused reproposed remanufacture resource efficient reorganized redesigned recover prevention etc where training and inspiration of employees and customers are vital Although this is already the case for some of the players involved mostly large and luxury hotel brands as already men tioned there is not muchpublished data especially in the form of case studies and detailed assessments of stakeholder engagement to effectively achieve the environmental performance objectives Moreover this new step forward approach should be adopted across the entire tourism chain along with a strong commitment from all stakeholders In this effort local competent authorities should play a vital role in providing and promoting favorable measures for hotels with high environmental performance such as tax breaks reduction of administrative fees extension of permits validity reduction of financial guar antees green public procurement credit access and funding support In general if this regulatory relief will be implemented it will significantly help the tourism industry to adopt the targets set forth by CE the EU Green Deal the USA Green New Deal and most importantly by the UN SDGs and the zerowaste approach eg by reducing pollution and the presence of micro plastics in coastal areas and beyond Furthermore it will help increase hotels environmental performance and efficiency in their profitability by reducing resource consumption and making these destinations more attractive Moreover other soft activities such as the gamification of the environmental objectives by developing and using mobile phone applications may attract engagement in the new waste management strategies that hotels andor the tourist promotion industry apply Steps forward to adopt a circular economy strategy by the tourism industry WMR XWaste Management ResearchEditorial editorial Editorial Waste Management Research Reducing the volume of food wastes generated by the tourism industry and their subsequent disposal in landfills is also crucial as the processing of t of food waste can produce approximately m of biogas and emit approximately t of CO Based on current estimates if food waste was a country it would be the rd largest emitter of GHGs with almost bln t CO equivalent per year Managing tourism industrygenerated food wastes either for energy recovery or compost production could make a vital contribution to climate change and pollution mitigation and preservation of biodiversity The implementation of waste manage ment strategies such as waste prevention zerowaste approach upcycling etc based on real facts ie waste generation index waste accumulation rate waste production rate waste compositional analysis clean coast index waste recycling index waste recovery index material flow analysis etc in this new mindset poses a real challenge for the tourism industry as tourism has over the last decades already substantially expanded Equally importantly following adoption of this approach a carefully designed monitoring plan is essential to gradually improve per formance through periodic adjustment to the approach as new information becomes available Circular economy in many countries such as China is encour aged as a topdown national policy while mostly in EU USA and Japan it is a tool to design bottomup environmental and waste management strategies andor policies To adopt a CE strategy whether a topdown or a bottomup approach a new international standard must be developed promoted and advertised the soonest possible from a widely accepted organization such as the International Standard Organization ISO This standard should be efficient but also simple enough to be used by all kinds and sizes of tourism organizations in any geographical area that aims at shifting from a linear to a CE model All this by increasing the effectiveness of the circular use of resources while at the same time endorsing economic and social benefits and effectively engaging the entire stakeholder chain Regarding this the ISO has already established in a Technical Committee on CE Moreover the current use of ISO EMAS Ecolabel GreenKey etc should be mandated for all while waiting for the new international standard to be developed and implemented A shift to a CE business model involves more than the imple mentation of new processes and activities however It also requires a new way of identifying value and cooperation within the value chain and a corresponding change in organizational culture Enterprises related to the tourism industry must realize that applying the CE framework and philosophy into their organization can take time however the result will be a future of sustainability security and opportunity that they can in turn use to attain a better position in their respective field of engagement The tourism industry in general has been relatively slow to change with the times even though there is evidence that some hotels adopted ecofriendly approaches ie informed the clients to reuse their towels or supplying in each room dual waste bins one for trash the other for recyclables etc Yet in the face of ongoing and growing adverse effects from loss of biodiversity pollution climate change and other environmental pressures it is imperative that tourism companies move to quickly improve their sustainability performance and adopt effective CE strate gies They should display their achievements through sustainability reports considering at the same time tourist views and behaviors in the framework of waste management Moreover behavioral changes and public participation is key to a functional waste handling system in the tourism industry It must also be noted that in order for the tourism sector to be able to adopt a CE framework it has to focus on initiatives that will help to reduce natural resources consumption instead of helping the continua tion of existing one way consumption patterns This cannot be elaborated without interaction with other participants in the tour ism industry and even beyond A general approach of implanting CE in the tourism industry may include control of resources and waste through a total quality management system which will combine all the wellknown standards such as ISO any or all EMS Corporate Social Responsibility Health and Safety the ISO food hygiene based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point HACCP principles as well as the international standards focused on a CE model Furthermore this will include a product and services control eg reuse your towels power cut off timer for lights dual waste bins in hotel rooms no longer offering plastic straws etc and new practices ie reusable towels and other materials rather than single used in pool activities that will be adopted from the tourists as well as the operators and owners Tourist practices should go beyond the traditional customer role as tourism can very well be a crucial testbed for new types of CE developments such as demarketing in order to discourage guests from certain purchases so as to reduce negative impacts eg hoteliers may charge any single used item if the customer asked for it such as straws or could restrict the number of food varieties in buffet menus to avoid food waste Similarly decommodification of tourist practices by new forms of peertopeer accommodation travel etc will help to achieve sustainability by collaborative consumption This while decreasing the influence of commodities and effectively limiting the effect of commercialization as tourists and other relevant stakeholders rent or borrow goods and services rather than buying or owning them An interesting approach through a gamification concept that would interconnect websites eg Trip Advisor with the environmental performance of any destination or tourist services ie hotels restaurants etc is on priority as customer rating practices could help the tourist industry to adopt a CE strategy Overall the tourism industry has a vital role to play both in the areas of economic growth and job development and even more importantly in sustainable resource management to minimize if not eliminate waste production and to improve overall environmental protection and sustainability Hence the evolution of the industry toward a CE path in order to minimize its environmental footprint is of paramount importance to all of us In this respect International Solid Waste Association ISWA as a worldleading organization on the management of solid waste and its numerous dedicated and wellplaced professionals will be called upon to provide the necessary technical expertise training and informationinnovation development monitoring exchange and Editorial propagation for the effective adoption of a CE strategy by the tourism industry Also taking into account the significant scientific knowledge gaps mainly in targeted and thorough case studies destinationspecific data and detailed assessments of stakeholder engagement to effectively achieve the environmental performance objectives
