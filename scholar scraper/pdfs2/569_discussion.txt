Porto is still in the initial stages of becoming a circular city. Nevertheless, the city is part of the
Eurocities group and has the objective of becoming fully circular by 2030 [ 25]. Evaluating the city
circularity with CCAF shows how the city is doing in some sectors, while still lagging in others.
The different sectors of Porto demonstrate initiative towards circularity. Most signiﬁcantly, waste
management, water management, and the cork industry are successful examples. CE innovation and
the food and transport sectors require a critical shift towards circularity. The remaining sectors are
already in a circular path and require further measures.
A higher interconnectivity between sectors—synergies that result in less waste and higher
efﬁciency—is desirable. This can be achieved if the different sectors adopt a circular perception,
together with transparency and cooperation [8].
4.1. Case Study Discusion
In this section, each sector will be discussed. This discussion relies mostly on Porto’s performance,
and lessons can be learned for other cities aiming to shift towards circularity.
Looking at Porto’s local resources, the city has the potential to increase energetic independency
through solar and wind. Economically, a more export-oriented philosophy must be adopted, making
more use of the local resources and recirculating some of Porto’s products. This is in line with
the CE characteristic of being a generator instead of a consumer [ 15]. Finally, there is a push from
Porto towards the installation of more green areas, which result in a higher life quality and enable
synergies [45].
In the renewable energy ﬁeld, Portugal is on a promising path, supported by a grid network that
connects the entire country. A next step could be decentralized power adoption that is incentivized by
the government; this would provide more energetic independence and resilience to cities and buildings.
