electrical and electronic equipment weee sustainable production and consumption disposal recycling literature review abstract to tackle the alarming increase in ewaste or endoflife eol electronic products consumer behavior towards the end of their useful life needs to be thoroughly studied end users or consumers are the starting point where e waste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy ce such as repair reuse remanu facturing and recycling ewaste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of ewaste with household waste by consumers studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to achieve ce numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers ewasterelated knowledge and awareness and behavior on consumption disposal storage recycling and repair substantial knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around ewaste may be integrated into the ce model this article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing research papers published in international peerreviewed journals identified in the web of science wos core collection database using content analysis methodology to analyze and review the articles the study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a more consumercentric ce framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and implementation strategies around ewaste this is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer behavior around ewaste the study results show that consumers disposal and recycling behaviors are the two main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed in contrast reuse and repair behavior were investigated to a lesser extent in this study several research gaps and areas for future research are identified along with suggestions for a ce framework focusing on the ewaste sector that encompasses policy initiatives and business model innovations the identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are starting to work on consumer behaviorrelated ewaste research introduction the rapid technological revolution coupled with increasing demand among consumers for hightech products has triggered unprecedented levels of electrical and electronic equipment eee consumption at this moment there are approximately different types of eee found in the international market forti et al electronic waste ewaste or waste electrical and electronic equipment weee that eee becomes at the end of its useful life poses a severe challenge to the environment as well as to human health due to the presence of highly toxic substances balde et al ewaste management em is one of the most pressing problems for today s modern society islam and huda a with around million tons of ewaste generated worldwide in and levels escalating rapidly forti et al aside from reducing negative impacts improved management of e waste streams represents a

the blocks and factors interact in a relatively complicated manner requiring an interdisciplinary approach to solve problems in this case information on legal economic social business and environmental aspects are particularly critical brissaud and zwolinski in ewaste was first considered as a priority waste stream in europe and in the european union eu weee directive was published directive parajuly and wenzel argued that the ewaste stream possesses a high possibility for reuse and valuable ma terial recovery the directive imposes strict obligations on producers regarding waste management under the extended producer re sponsibility epr system horta arduin et al more recently the eu ce action plan works towards closing the loop of product lifecycles through sustainable production and consumption and sound waste management eu due to the diverse range of eee products the eu categorized ewaste items into six different segments table shows the categories sample products and legislative provisions of recovery reuse and recycling for the member states in recent times research related to consumers awareness of ewaste consumption storage disposal and recycling behavior has been gaining fig ewaste consumers and ce model adapted from macarthur and parajuly et al fig building blocks of ce alamerew and brissaud mt islam et al journal of cleaner production attention among researchers worldwide broadly consumer behavior focusing on ewaste can be categorized into several areas consumption storage repair and reuse rr disposal and recycling bovea md et al knowledge and awareness about the formal collection system among consumers are also critical aspects that determine the sustainability of the system in the socioeconomic sphere several studies such as the study by islam et al a ramzan et al saphores et al and others emphasized the issue ewasterelated policy management system architecture countryspecific consumer culture and behavior and availability of a diverse range of product categories in the market and their interaction with consumers create a complex phenomenon defining and connecting building blocks and definitions of circular economy with a sustainable ewaste management system literature related to the consumer behaviors around ewaste is proliferating however no comprehensive review article is found that analyzed all the behaviors to spot the future research directions and developing a consumercentric circular economy framework focusing on ewaste this paper tries to eliminate such gaps by reviewing articles published between and march using content analysis meth odology the main research questions rqs of the article are rq how do the issues related to consumer awareness and behavior with a particular focus on the ewaste sector contribute to the essential operational framework in achieving a ce rq how can the general understanding contribute to informing policymakers and researchers in identifying future policy measures to be taken and the necessity of performing research studies in the area after reviewing articles published on consumer behavior around e waste in section a consumercentric ce framework is proposed with policy implications and business model innovation under section with this rq was answered based on the indepth literature review of the selected articles research gaps were identified proposing critical future research directions in section by which rq was addressed the research contributions of this review article are it provided a guide or reference for future researchers to accumulate all the infor mation and knowledge surrounding consumer behaviorrelated topics focusing on ewaste it attempted to propose measures achieving a circular economy more holistically from a framework perspective focusing on sustainable consumer behavior and ewaste in many cases published papers did not consider the ce concept into their central research theme focusing instead on various behavioral aspects the framework incorporated behaviorspecific aspects into ce pathways creating interdisciplinary research opportunities in the field besides presenting a quantitative assessment of the research progress in the field the article provided a transparent and replicable methodology which could also be utilized collecting materials from other available databases in this paper issues related to policy and business model innovation are discussed respectively which provide suggestions for both researchers and policymakers in systemlevel development and future research areas and on the research topic potential future research directions have been identified which could be useful for future researchers the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section dis cusses some earlier review articles section describes the research methodology an indepth analysis of the literature is presented in section results and discussion are illustrated in section finally section ends with the conclusion literature review to clarify the need of this review article some of the previously published review articles worth mentioning table provides details of the previous articles on the topic which also helped to perform a structured literature review based on the content analysis methodology details of the methodology is described in section based on table it is evident that in recent time no comprehensive literature review article has been published on all the consumers behavioral aspects focusing on ewaste scopes of the articles also showed that consideration of various product types was not given in the previous review articles and issues were discussed more in the local context thus a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding a holistic picture of consumers behavior around ewaste this is the first attempt at reviewing consumer awareness and behavior focused on e waste considering all the behavioral aspects to the best of the authors knowledge research methodology according to easterbysmith et al and brocke et al a literature review plays a critical role in understanding and exploring a specific research field s structure new theory development and inves tigation scope could further progress the knowledge base by identifying a useful literature review machi and mcevoy in this study the foursteps systematic literature review technique proposed by mayring under the qualitative content analysis method is utilized fig shows the four steps process model for the content analysis method consisting of material collection descriptive analysis category selec tion and material evaluation mayring provided an extensive discussion on the method previously several literature review articles have applied the research methodology to ewaste research eg wati

considered later public or consumer or consumers or customer or household or resident or residents keywords were input in the refine search box of the database that retrieved a total of articles as the studies need to have a primary survey component as part of the methodology the keyword survey was used in the refined search which delivered articles the search was performed on november other criteria for selecting the articles were that the methodology section of the article must specify the sample size sam pling technique and the number of the valid samples of the participants in some cases a few studies identified through the search involved surveyed stakeholders other than consumers such as repair technicians in the study by sabbaghi et al these were excluded from the selection as the group does not represent consumers finally arti cles were found that focused only on consumers behavior around ewaste the articles collected in the materialcollection stage showed that authors had analyzed more than one issue in most cases for example perezbelis et al investigated the secondhand pur chase and repair behavior of consumers focusing on small it equipment in which they investigated consumption rr and disposal behavior altogether table shows the article selection process for this review article descriptive analysis the following subsections illustrate the analysis

china under the group of developing countries produced the highest number of articles pa pers until november and this number is higher than the number of papers published by some of the countries from developed nations such as the usa articles and spain articles malaysia papers india papers and brazil papers were some of the other devel oping countries in which consumers behavior was studied even though ewaste is a global environmental problem and consumer behavior is an important factor for ewaste impacts surprisingly consumer behavior was studied in relatively few countries for instance from australia there are only two academic papers published on the issue in product diversity in papers as consumer behavior varies substantially according to the cate gories of the products and specific

while all the papers selected for this review article involved survey to some extent studies were classified within the survey category if they were performed using any market research methodology such as the contingent valuation method cvm a surveybased economic technique that was implemented mainly for assessing consumers will ingness to pay this survey category was created to separate these research methodologies from others that were more statistical theo retical analytical or case study focused approaches that fall under the case study category include quasiethnographic approaches direct waste analysis and word of mouth research methodologies when cross cultural and crosscountry studies were performed then those were considered as case studies theory of planned behavior tpb is one of the dominant theories used in the analysis technique coupled with structural equation modeling sem sem is a combined statistical technique consisting of multiple regression path analysis and factor analysis ajzen first postulated the tpb and later several extended versions of the theory have been implemented in marketing research this evolved out of the theory of reasoned action which states that intentions are the best predictors of behaviors the central premise of tpb is that something is more likely to be done if there is a plan to do it according to tpb in tentions are the product of three different processes behavioral at titudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control papers that applied tpb particularly in ewasterelated consumer behavior research are presented in the
