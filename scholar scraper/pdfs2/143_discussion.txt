5.1 Limitations  
5.1.1 The challenge of measuring  FSWL  
Our work introduced several new terms to make it easier to deal with food waste in the 
upcoming era of the circular economy. Yet, the boundaries of wording clarification and 
concepts categorization must also meet those of  quantification when it comes to 
implementing concrete policies  and evaluate their efficiency . 
Up till now, consistently with the famous adage ―you cannot manage what cannot be 
measured‖, most studies have focused on quantifiable recycling and recovery strategies 
(Eriksson et al., 2015;  Vea et al., 2018; Galanakis, 2012) . The complexity of quantifyi ng 
prevention, the top priority policy -wise, has already been acknowledged.  In fact, it has been 
highlighted as the least measurable among the waste hierarchy treatments (Mourad, 2016) . 
Prevention from the primary production to the retail can be achieved by  more efficient 
management. However, the consumer stage is pa rticularly challenging to influence and 
measure as it involves many factors that interact together. These factors include economic 
motives, soci al drivers and cultural pressure as well as individual preference s. While 
economic reasons, e.g. saving money, are a driving force for behavioral change (Thyberg and 
Tonjes, 2016) , socio -psychological motivations, such as conservatism, misinformation and 
bureaucratic resistance, can rep resent up to 40% of difficulties for waste prevention 
(Henningsson et al., 2004) . Economic factors are further influenced by geographic, cultural, 
political and personal reasons linked to food waste generation (Thyberg and Tonjes, 2016) , 
with different countries having different waste generation patterns.  This being said, 
Searchinger et al. (2019) highlighted different generic easy -to-operate strategies for 
prevention, such as smaller portion sizes in r estaurants at a different price, and avoiding Journal Pre-proof
