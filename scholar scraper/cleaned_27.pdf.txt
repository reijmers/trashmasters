Article T owards a circular economy in food consumption Food waste reduction practicesas ethical work Taru Lehtokunnas Malla Mattila Elina N arv anen and Nina Mesiranta T ampere University Finland Abstract This article explores the transition towards a circular economy in the context of household food waste practices The research concerning the circular economy hasmainly focused on engineering or the processes of production manufacturing business and industry However the transition towards a circular economy requires in addition to new technologies infrastructures and innovations a societal change and a change ineveryday practices In this article we address this by examining the everyday practices of food waste reduction in households as ethical work We claim that the intertwined practices institutions and policies of the circular economy create moral categories andresponsibilities in everyday food consumption Thus the transition towards circular economy requires everyday ethical work carried out by consumers However our analysis also brings out some possible challenges related to this transition that hasnot yet been accomplished Our research materials consist of food waste diaries collected from Finnish households and participant observation in leftover cooking workshops organized with the Finnish Martha organization We adapt Michel Foucaultsconception of ethics focusing on the constitution of ethical subjectivity in food waste practices Moreover we utilize practice theoretical approach that has been widely used in food waste and sustainable consumption studies and connect it with Foucaultstheory Our results suggest that in order to understand the circular economy as a moral economy it is crucial to note the moral complexity of everyday life that results from partly contradictory ethical sensitivities and practices Corresponding author T aru Lehtokunnas Faculty of Social Sciences T ampere University T ampere Finland Email

subjectivity Foucault circular economy moral economy practice theory Introduction Production of food waste is currently signicantly affecting the sustainability of the food system alongside the consumption of meat and dairy products Due to the economic environmental and social signicance of food waste reducing it is also part of the European Unions Circular Economy Strategy PrietoSandoval et al The aim of this strategy is to increase resource efciency by main taining the value of materials through closing the loop of the product life cycle EU Commission Thus the transition towards a circular economy CE requires changes in technological infrastructures business models and consump tion practices Geissdoerfer et al However research concerning the CE has mainly focused on the engineering domain and the processes of manufacturing and production Korhonen et al More research is needed for understanding the transition in the sociomaterial underpinnings of everyday life that the transition towards a CE requires Mylan et al This article argues that a CE is a moral economy Gregson et al This refers to an economic approach that aims to assess the moral justications of the economic organization and moreover the responsibilities and possibilities of acting in its context Sayer In the context of the CE moral categories that are created through the moral problematization of practices perceived as unsustainable or morally wrong are part of the logic of economic organization Gregson et al For example such commonplace food consumption prac tice as reusing leftovers is a morally and ethically charged activity that constitutes consumer subjectivity This article takes the practices of living with the abundance of food as its starting pointThus our perspective is based on the necessity of dealing with excess production Valkonen et al As things stand current production volumes force people to nd environmentally and morally sustainable ways to live with food waste and other excess materials To explore this subject we adopt Foucaults theory on ethical subjectiv ity to examine the practices of reducing food waste Foucaults theory enables not only the examination of individual consumer practices but also the suggestion of wider modes of ethical action in society as well In addition to Foucaults conception of ethical subjectivity our theoretical framework draws from the practicetheoretical approach Evans et al Reckwitz Shove Practice theories have been previously used as an analytical frame work in research concerning sustainable consumption in general GramHanssen Plessz et al Shove and food waste in particular Evans Mattila et al N arvanen et al Southerton and Yates Journal of Consumer Culture We address the practices of food waste reduction as everyday ethical work on the self that aims to transform food consumption practices towards sustainabilityOur research is guided by the question how is ethical subjectivity constituted for reducing food waste in the context of circular economy Our research materials consist of participant observations from leftover cooking workshops organized with the Finnish Martha Organization and food waste diaries from Finnish households The study participants are mainly people interested in sustainability and thereduction of food waste and thus construct their ethical subjectivity in this context Although we adapt the Foucauldian approach to ethics we also perceive that the ethical subjectivity in relation to food waste is constituted in situated and sometimes messy mundane events Woolgar and Neyland Based on this weperceive the ethical relation as constantly produced and situated in everyday practices not simply internalized by our participants The circular economy food waste and practice theory The CE can be dened as an alternative to the socalled linear economic model of take make and dispose perceived as unsustainable Ness The transition to a CE requires not only improved treatment of waste but also the curtailment ofdisposal Ghisellini et al Thus the implementation of a CE calls for radically alternative solutions in the whole economic model and resource management Ghisellini et al Moreover some researchers have also emphasized the importance of the connection between the generation of food waste and wastemanagement Alexander et al in CE the use of waste for protmay conict with the aim to protect the environment by reducing waste Valkonen et al The elds of industrial ecology and both ecological and environmental econom ics have been the most signicant domains to date for research concerning CE Ghisellini et al Korhonen et al However the research on CE has paid less attention to consumers and consumption This would be crucial for betterunderstanding the transformation to a CE since the transition requires changes ineveryday consumption practices Mylan et al As Hobson has argued Extant academic policy and businessled analyses frame transforma tions towards the CE as predominantly issues of innovation technical systemsscal and business incentives and reformulated business models p To ll thisgap in research we analyse the transition towards a CE from the viewpoint ofeveryday food waste practices in households Our research takes place in Finland where food waste became a widely dis cussed problem after the Finnish Institute for Agriculture and Forestry MTT began investigating it at the beginning of the s Raippalinna Like in other countries in the Global North most of Finlands food waste emerges inhouseholds the amount of food wasted annually by households is million kilograms Natural Resources Institute Finland Luke nd In additionLehtokunnas et al Finlands public discourse is affected by EU objectives for consumerlevel food waste reduction Raippalinna We adopt the practicetheoretical approach in our analysis Hargreaves Warde According to a muchcited denition by Reckwitz a social practice Praktik is a routinized type of behaviour which consists of several ele ments interconnected to one other forms of bodily activities forms of mental activ ities things and their use a background knowledge in the form of understanding knowhow states of emotion and motivational knowledge p Practice theory is increasingly applied in the domain of sustainability research because it allows consumption to be analysed as a social phenomenon Corsini et al Some of the previous practicetheoretical research concerning food waste and sustain able consumption has stressed that sustainability policies cannot be targeted only to change the actions of individual consumers while the material and social contexts ofoverconsumption remain unchangeable Evans Evans et al Shove Thus research on sustainable consumption should shift focus from individual consumers to the collective routinized and mundane aspects of consumption GramHanssen Moreover Sahakian and Wilhite state that in the context of sustainable consumption agency is distributed between people objects and infra structures that inuence and are inuenced by everyday life Thus unsustainablebehaviour cannot be changed simply through topdown management or behaviour change rather the surrounding circumstances must be addressed as well Social scientic research concerning food waste and sustainable consumption has paid little attention to the transition towards the CE apart from the research of Mylan et al on domestic food provisioning However practicetheoretical food waste research has shown among other things that the social material andtemporal contexts of eating are important for understanding the production of food waste in households Southerton and Yates that preventing food waste through cooking from leftovers requires varied culinary skills and knowledgeCappellini N arvanen et al and that the production of food waste is a consequence of keeping a family wellfed Watson and Meah It has also acknowledged the signicance of nonhumans in the production and reduction offood waste Mattila et al Moreover Alexander et al have pointed out that the cause for household food waste can also sometimes be earlier in the food chain for example household food waste might emerge from too big portion sizes From these viewpoints the material and social contexts of everyday life and the embodied knowledge are central to the production and reduction of food waste In line with the above we approach food waste reduction as a social practice emphasizing the dynamics between ethical action and persistent sociomaterial practices that delimit transformation We connect previous practicetheoretical work on food waste and sustainable consumption studies with Foucaults theoryconcerning ethical subjectivity According to Reckwitz Foucaults late work on ethics can be perceived as praxeological However Foucaults work Journal of Consumer Culture has not been widely used in practicetheoretical research on food waste or sustain able consumption apart from Hawkins research concerning the ethicalrelationship to waste Thus this article deepens the understanding of ethical subjectivity in practicetheoretical research on food waste Moral economies and the constitution of ethical subjectivity in food waste reduction practices We approach the transition towards the CE in everyday practices through the concept of moral economy Gregson et al have pointed out in theirresearch concerning the CE and resource recovery in the EU that a CE is a moral economy since there are right and wrong ways to circulate materials By referring to the discussion concerning moral economy we aim to highlightthat the practices institutions and policies connected to the CE create moral categories in the mundane practices of everyday life These categories could be expressed for example through obligations such as recycling food waste Thus the concept of moral economy is useful in understanding the transition tothe CE at the level of everyday life Our analysis on the moralities of the CE is guided by Foucaults con ception of ethics as arts of existence Foucault states that the self is not givento us and that to become ethical subjects we have to constitute ourselves as ethical beings For Foucault the constitution of the ethical self is not selfcentred action it is about creating an ethos a way relating to others He divides the arts of existence into four techniques of the self ethical substance mode of subjectivationselfforming activity and telos Foucault Ethical substance refers to the part of the self that is worked over by ethics in other words the matter of the ethical work Foucault The mode of subjectivation means theway in which people are invited or incited to recognize their moral obligationsFoucault Selfforming activity refers to the measures we take to mod erate ourselves as ethical subjects The fourth dimension telos means the objective of our moral behaviour Foucault Foucaults conceptualization of ethical subjectivity adds to the understanding of the ethical practices of food consumption and the CE as a moral economy byshowing the concrete work consumers do to evaluate sustain and transformtheir practices Through this it enables us to address the possibilities for consumer agency in the context of the transformation to a CE Referring to Foucault the ways in which people form ethical subjectivity are not invented by the individuals themselves Rather they are based on the models suggested by society socialgroup or culture Foucault Thus using Foucaults conception enables us to take a look not only at the ways our participants act as individuals but also at the modes of ethical action suggested more widely in the surrounding society orculture It also allows us to examine the limitations that practices bring to theenactment of ethical behaviour and how these difculties in following moralLehtokunnas et al principles are justied explained and rationalized by our participants Referring to Shove our analysis of the transformation of the practices does not perceiveour participants as autonomous agents of change p Rather we perceive that daily domestic conventions are sustained and changed through the ongoing reproduction of social practice Shove Research materials and methods Our research material consists of participant observation in leftover cookingworkshops organized with the Finnish Martha organization in spring and food waste diaries collected from Finnish households during spring The participant observation material was collected as a part of a research projectconcerning the reduction of food waste on the consumer level and the food waste diaries are part of the rst authors PhD dissertation project The workshops were documented using the EthOS mobile application designed for ethnographic research Our research can thus be seen as ethnographically informed However it differs from traditional ethnographic research since it did not include longtermeld work in a natural eld Emerson et al In any case this kind of data enables us to observe the ethical considerations of the participants since the cooking workshop focused on the reduction of food waste by cooking creatively from leftovers Furthermore while it is difcult to gain access to the participants everyday lives through traditional participantobservation at home this method offers us a resourceefcient way of accessing the phenomenon at hand Sirola et al Four workshops were designed in cooperation with the Martha organizations specialist and they lasted from hours with a maximum of participants in each In addition to the participant observation material we analyse the food waste diaries to achieve a closer view of peoples everyday practices related to food in their homes the diaries enable us to observe the participants mundane routin ized practices Diaries enable regularity personality and contemporaneity in datacollection Alaszewski Thus the diaries enable us to analyse concrete every day practices rather than only observing the workshops and relying on partici pants descriptions of their practices Through these two data sets we illustratehow consumers perform their everyday foodrelated practices and how they aim to modify and transform them The diaries were kept by a casual sampling of people recruited mainly from different Finnish Facebook groups Puskaradio Sein ajoki Ruokah avikkiryhm a Tampereryhm a Vegaaniryhm a and by sharing the research call on the rst authors Facebook wall The diaries were kept for aperiod of weeks by the participants The participants of our study are mainly women and most live in the biggest cities of Finland It is crucial to note that most of the participants are notably concerned about food waste and the environmental issues related to it This emphasis in our data results from the simple fact that it is hard to getpeople with no interest in the subject to take part in the research Participant Journal of Consumer Culture backgrounds obviously affect the ways in which they verbalize their practices and this unavoidably has an effect on the results of our research but it would be hard to answer our research question with data from people with little or no interest inthe subject The quotes presented in the following section of this article have been translated from Finnish to English by the authors with the aim of retaining as much idio matic meaning as possible The diary material and the participant observationmaterial were both encoded using the Atlasti software The rst author of this article did the preliminary coding and the other authors commented on the emer gent ndings The codes were arranged according to Foucaults four dimensions of ethical subjectivity Analysis In this section we analyse the four dimensions of ethical work carried out byconsumers in the practices of reducing food waste Our focus is on how everyday practices enable and restrict possibilities for making food consumption practices more sustainable through ethical work on the self Ethical substance The ethical substance refers to the part of the self that is perceived to need moral processing Foucault The ethical substance in the context of food consump tion is articulated very clearly throughout the data Current food consumptionpractices are perceived as wasteful and unethical and food consumption thus hasto be modied In the data the disposal of food is rather often described as a sin or waste Wasting food raises feelings of annoyance disturbance and anger Frugality with food is seen as a moral duty This is connected with the environmentalconcerns related to food waste but it also reects a more direct moral obligation to respect food In the following quote a participant describes how she perceives the disposal of food as a sin Though I have a passionate attitude towards the subject since I think that dis posing of food is a kind of sin Climate change forces people to observe their ownwastefulness Diary entry a yearold woman living with her yearold child The participant recognizes that food consumption is a signicant factor affecting climate change She sees the wastefulness of people as the main reason for the stateof the planet that is the participant considers that people have to modify their wasteful food consumption practices for environmental reasons The participants statement has a strong moral charge she connects Christian ethics wasting foodis a sin to the moral obligation to act in a way that minimizes the effects of theconsumption on the climate Thus the reason for avoiding food waste is not the biblical virtue of frugality but instead the current ecological crisis that forcesLehtokunnas et al people to observe their consumption behaviour However it is not enough to be aware of the problem concrete and material actions must be taken to modify consumption Koskinen et al see also Evans Southerton andYates Unfortunately awareness does not often easily translate into action as the following quotations on coffee consumption illustrate In the morning I realize I always make cups of coffee I drink only one cup This feels stupid I have not xed it Ive been too lazy to do that I count this as waste I decide to try to be better Diary entry a yearold woman living alone I still havent learned to make less coffee Diary entry same person Coffee still ends up in the trash Diary entry same person The diary acts as a disrupting element that forces the participant to notice her wasteful routinized behaviour However as the quote suggests turning this obser vation into action and actually making less coffee is not straightforward Referring to Evans domestic conventions are intertwined with the social and materialorganization of everyday life It is easy to make too much coffee because coffee is readily available and using a coffee maker is effortless In this quote the art of existence is formed through attempts to modify the resilient everyday reality The rational objective to protect the environment is not the only reason raised for the avoidance of food waste Previous research on food waste has shown that existing cultural logics make people feel guilty about throwing food away Watsonand Meah A large variety of emotions is often present in foodwasterelat ed practices such as excitement when preventing food waste by cooking from leftovers or guilt when disposing of spoiled food In the following eld note aparticipant in a leftover cooking workshop describes her feelings towards the dis posal of food A participant tells me that soup is a dish that they usually cook from leftovers In the winter she does not buy tomatoes since they do not taste good and it is terrifying if they end up as waste A eld note from a food waste cooking workshop The participant describes it as terrifying to see food wasted This participant does not articulate clearly why the disposal of food is so upsetting or terrifying insteadassuming that her feelings are in some way commonly shared and understood As Reckwitz has pointed out every practice contains a certain practice specic emotionality p Thus according to him emotions are not only theinternal feelings of individuals they also belong to practices as a form of knowl edge Reckwitz Negative feelings are part of the practice of disposing of food Thus in addition to the rational objective to protect the environment fromthe effects of overconsumption emotions are central to the modication of food consumption practices Journal of Consumer Culture Mode of subjectivation In Foucaults conception of ethics the mode of subjectivation invites us to recognize moral commitments and it further refers to the ways in which individuals constitute their relation to a moral rule and recognize themselves as obligated to put it into practice p xxx As our analysis concerning the ethical substance has illus trated the matter of ethical work is unsustainable food consumption practices and the emotions connected with them Thus the moral rule of food waste practices could be do not waste food Based on this the central moral commitment in our data is to avoid wasting food and thus make consumption volumes more reasonable This has to be done in order to maintain the world that we live in in other words take care of the planet so that both we ourselves and future generations can live on it The relation to this moral obligation to avoid food waste is formed through the modication and observation of ones own and other peoples behaviour In the food waste diaries this became particularly apparent when our participants told us about observing the actions of their family members and educating them Many of the participants described irritation or frustration with how their family members friends or acquaintances treated food Thus acting as an educator or observer is part of forming the relationship to the moral obligation to avoid wasting foodA participant describes her frustration with her children as follows The way our children treat food sometimes makes me angry They do not scrape kettles etc properly and always leave a little food in the bottom of the kettle They might also take too much food I persistently try to eat their leftovers even though I am vegetarian and occasionally on a vegan diet I also try to remind my children that they should not dispose of food Diary entry a year old woman living with her husband three children and three cats It is important for the participant to train her children to consume food wisely and make a note of it if they do not act in the right way Unfortunately her children do not always act in the way she wishes and she thus eats their leftovers even though they do not t in her diet Through these actions she creates her ethical relation to food Referring to Cappellini and Parsons revaluing and consuming leftovers is a practice towards food that signals family membership Thus while striving for the ethical aim to avoid food waste the participant also manifests her role as a member of the family by enacting the practice of eating her childrens leftovers In doing so she is giving up on her other preferences in order to full a greater aim In addition to the environmental concerns the prevention of food waste is impor tant for our participants because they often feel a sense of moral duty towards people who do not have enough food According to FAO of the United Nations nd million people are going hungry Our participants often state that it is immoral to waste food while a large group of the worlds population suffers from hunger For example one participant in the leftover cooking workshop told that she considers her wasteful food waste practices wrong since half of the world suffersLehtokunnas et al from hunger Based on this a sense of moral duty towards people who suffer from food scarcity is often central to relating to the moral rule of not wasting food However care of the self and family is also deeply connected with eating prac tices and this might cause contradictions between the avoidance of food waste and taking care of ones health It is important that the familys food is not spoiled for example and that no one overeats One participant in a leftover cooking workshopconsiders the importance of safety A participant is concerned about the safety of the food offered for the children She would not offer the children sh after the expiration date has passed she also says that she is very careful with what she eats so if the food is ne for her it is ne for the children She also says that she sometimes calls her sister who is a cook andasks her opinion on whether some food item is still edible or not A eld note from leftover cooking workshop In this quote the participant points out three methods for assessing the safety of the food expiration dates her own assessments and her sisters expert knowledge as a cook Assessment of edibility based on expiration dates links food to institutional governance an authority has provided guidelines regarding the safety of the food and since eating spoiled sh is a great risk the participant relies on this for certainty Moreover the participants own assessment is based on her embodied knowledge regarding the safety of the food If it is ne for me it is ne for the children Finally if the labelled date or the participants own knowledge is not sufciently reliable she trusts her sisters expertise as a professional cook to assessthe safety These different techniques of assessment show the ethical complexity of acting with surplus food in everyday life you cannot dispose food if you are not completely sure that it is not edible but however there is no room for mistakesregarding food safety when you cook for your family Thus the way the relation to the moral obligation to avoid wasting food is formed has much to do with the unpredictable and complex nature of everydaylife In addition to the avoidance of food waste there are several other demands that shape everyday requirements related to food such as caring for children As Meah and Jackson have pointed out in their research concerning careand convenience care can be manifested in many ways and these manners of expressing care do not all cohere with normative beliefs regarding the right ways to for example take care of ones health or environment Thus the relationto the obligation not to waste food has to be formed in a exible manner The need for this exibility might emerge for example from the production of food waste resulting from the unpredictability of how much the children will actually eatIn our data this has usually been accepted as an unavoidable part of everyday life A participant describes a frequent situation in her week diary I threw away rice that was left on my childs plate and when we were having supper I threw away a half slice of bread that my child did not eat I did not feel anything Journal of Consumer Culture while doing this since the food waste was not avoidable Diary entry a yearold woman living with her yearold child Child care sometimes leads to food waste and the participants acceptance of this is manifested through her statement that she did not feel anything while discarding her childs leftovers This was because the food waste was not avoidableObviously being a good parent does not involve pressing your children to eattoo much The willingness to take care of oneself by following a healthy diet can lead to food waste as well For example one participant describes in her diary how in theirhousehold most of the food waste results from the jars of food stored in therefrigerator such as pastes mayonnaise and jam She explains that these foodsusually spoil since she and her spouse do not eat them regularly and thus getdiscarded In these situations the commitment to healthy and diverse eating overtakes the moral obligation not to waste As Evans has brought out convention dictates that people should eat properly and eating mayonnaise and jam every day or pressing children to eat too much does not t into a proper diet All in all even though there is a moral commitment to prevent food waste theseunpredictable and ethically messy situations illustrated by our participants showhow the relation to the moral rule against wasting food is not formed straightforwardly Instead it is affected by multiple and sometimes contradictory ethicalsensitivities moral obligations practices and conventions Selfforming activity Selfforming activity means the techniques we use to become ethical subjectsFoucault Our participants pointed out several techniques for modifyingtheir behaviour These are often different techniques to disrupt the wasteful habitsrooted in everyday life such as notes hung on the refrigerator remedies learnedfrom the Internet friends or family and an overall sense of respect towards thefood In the leftover cooking workshops participants described that the attitude towards food is very important you should respect food and not be too picky However eating leftover food does not have to be unpleasant at all Cooking skillsand creativity are the key practical techniques to make leftover food desirable andaesthetic A participant describes how she cooked from leftovers There were some salad sliced raw red cabbage and a couple pieces of roasted carrot left from yesterdays meal At lunchtime I added some tomatoes sweet pepper and leafy greens to the meal I fried the red cabbage and carrots in a pan with seitan kebab In addition I cooked some broccoli from the fridge Diary entry a yearold woman living with her spouse The participant knows in detail the ingredients that were left from yesterday and what is needed to cook a new meal using them Her actions show her knowledgeLehtokunnas et al skills and creativity in cooking In the data participants often write that leftover food actually makes cooking easier since you can just add some new ingredients to an almostready meal In one of the leftover cooking workshops the participantsalso stressed the importance of aesthetics in cooking and serving the leftover food They claimed that beautifullooking food even tastes better This is part of the constitution of the ethical self Food waste is avoided but in a mannerthat is pleasant However leftover food is not always beautiful or aesthetic Leftovers are some times eaten out of a sense of responsibility not for pleasure For example eatingchildrens leftovers was rather usual for our participants A participant describes how he tries to avoid food waste when cooking for his two children I try to cook my children the kind of food they like and if they do not eat all the food from their plates or they have taken it too much I usually tell them to leave their plates on the table and I then eat their leftovers Diary entry a yearold manliving with his two children The avoidance of food waste requires knowledge of family members preferences Previous studies on food consumption show that feeding children is demanding work the food provided cannot be just any food it has to satisfy the family DeVault Furthermore eating childrens leftovers is a practice thatshapes the familys relations you would not eat leftovers from a strangers plate and it is usually one of the parents who eats the leftovers Eating leftovers is thus an expression of affection Cappellini and Parsons Based on this inthis quote eating the childrens leftovers constructs the ethical self in relation to food and family This quote does not tell whether this is pleasant for the father or not but in some parts of our data food is eaten rather than discarded even if it isunpleasant In these situations disciplined elements dene the ethical actions in relation to food A participant describes eating spoiled food I ate the food that was left at room temperature overnight and now my stomach hurts It was worth it anyway since I left the food there myself Diary entry a yearold woman living with her husband and dog In the quote above the participant seems to consider that she is responsible for letting the food spoil and thus it is morally right to suffer from the illness that iscaused by it Thus the mistake of forgetting the food on the table is compensated by taking the risk of falling ill The sensitivity and intimacy of eating are revealed in a very harsh manner when the food we eat makes us fall ill However it is notthat usual in our data that the participants would eat spoiled food Because of the risks and disgust we have a need to separate from spoiled food to maintain our self our own being Thus it is also important to note that discarding the food thatis not edible is an ethical act that constitutes the self Hawkins Based on this disposing of spoiled food is an inseparable part of domestic practices Evans Journal of Consumer Culture and cannot be dened only as unethical or careless behaviour Even though wasting food is morally problematic separating from the spoiled food can be a revealing experience We cleaned our fridge and disposed of a bit of spoiled yoghurt the remainder of the iced tea a couple of mouldy sweet potato balls a bit of tofu and a last piece of pastry forgotten in the fridge Cleaning the fridge felt good even though it is a pity to throwfood away Diary entry a year old woman living with her spouse and dog In the above quote separating from spoiled food cleanses the personal environ ment and the self This kind of need to separate from the spoiled and dirty food is atechnique of the ethical self that might sometimes be contradictory with the morallogic of the CE The disposal of food is unpleasant and problematic but it is sometimes necessary Thus the practices related to our conceptions of cleanliness might sometimes contradict with the ethical aim to prevent food waste Hawkins Moreover conventions related to cleanliness such as keeping the refrigerator free ofspoiled products are a normalized part of everyday practices Shove Thusdisposal is also signicant for the practices of forming the ethical self Hawkins Most of our participants have the option to recycle their food waste with their condominiums biowaste recycling bin However some of the participants have theirown compost bins A participant tells about her recycling habits My relationship to shrivelled carrots and dried bread might be of interest to you I think that they are material for my bokashi compost bin They will transform intoselfmade nutritious soil for my vegetable garden They are not worthless waste I usethe bokashi around the year and I use my condominiums biowaste bin only forthe waste that emerges from my dogs meatbased foods such as chicken legs Thus the carbon emissions are really low since using bokashi is a closedcircle activ ity Diary entry a yearold woman living with her three dogs The quote above shows how different recycling practices transform the relation to food and moreover the ontology of the food itself The food that cannot be used as human nourishment turns into nourishment for plants that are to be eatenThis constitutes a closed circle for food waste Here food waste is not shut outof the personal environment to the system of waste management instead its transformation becomes part of the daily routine Thus some new technologies and material arrangements of living with food waste have potential for transforming food waste practices towards the acceptance of waste rather than its avoidanceHawkins Telos Telos refers to the ultimate goal of the moral behaviour Foucault In our data climate change is sometimes explicitly given as a major inuence on theLehtokunnas et al willingness to transform wasteful food consumption practices However the rea sons for the willingness to avoid food waste are not usually stated clearly or explicitly in our data instead participants often merely say for example that avoiding food waste is important for them that they have learned at home that food does not belong in the bin that they avoid food waste for ethical reasons or that they have an inner will to avoid food waste The following quote illustratesthis in more detail When asked about the reasons for participating in the leftover cooking workshop the participant responds that she felt a sense of responsibility towards the subject A eld note from a leftover cooking workshop It seems that the appreciation of food by not throwing it away is a moral aim that connects the food to several different factors such as environmental concerns care for distant others and overall emotional commitments related to food Thus wedene the telos of the moral behaviour as becoming a responsible citizen by avoiding or recycling food waste in the context of the CE In more detail such a responsible citizen aims to create a balanced relationship to the self other people and the environment Through this the aim is to create a thrifty ethos by doing everything that is possible to avoid the disadvantages of food waste The following quote illustrates this Avoiding food waste has always been important for me If I go to a restaurant and do not eat all of the food I always take the leftovers with me I buy only as much food as I eat years back I was a regular dumpster diver due to my small income andenvironmental reasons It felt at the same time good and bad to nd raw fruit and cakes in neighbours bins Diary entry a yearold woman living with her rabbit The prevention of food waste is not limited only to the above participants own domestic practices Utilizing other peoples waste through dumpster diving reveals objects that have been shut out such as raw fruit and cakes The participant writes how it felt simultaneously good and bad to nd completely edible food from the bin It is nice to nd something useful but at the same time it reveals the magni tude of wastefulness Dumpster diving is a radical practice that constitutes the relationship to food and waste in a completely different way from the usual practices of use and disposal The participant presents herself as a responsible consum er who does everything possible to avoid food waste She thus points out the practices through which she aims to constitute herself as a responsible citizen in the context of the CE Concluding discussion Based on Foucaults ethical theory our analysis has explored through four differ ent dimensions how the work on ethical subjectivity enables the transformation of Journal of Consumer Culture food consumption practices into more sustainable and circular ones Foucaults theory on ethical subjectivity in combination with practicetheoretical research provides a useful analytical framework for consumer researchers to address various aspects of ethical consumption including energy consumption or air travel Furthermore the CE literature currently lacks indepth understanding about con sumer culture which provides consumer researchers an opportunity for crossfertilization following the path set by this study Our analysis reveals that the ethical substance in our data is the unsustainable food consumption practices and the emotions related to them Both are modiedthrough ethical work However habits are sometimes rooted deeply in everyday routines and thus are not always changed easily Our analysis suggests that the transition to a CE cannot be carried out only by teaching consumers the rightway to do things and providing infrastructures to implement the CE rather changing consumption practices is a process of constant transformation and modication Moreover the mode of subjectivation to the moral rule not to waste food is formed through observing and acting as an educator to the family and others Our participants felt a moral conviction to avoid food waste for environmental reasonsand because many people live with a shortage of food However as our analysis suggests concerns about the safety and healthiness of the food as well as the unpredictability of everyday life with children result in competing moral principles Thus the relation to the moral obligation to avoid food waste has to be formed in a exible manner The selfforming activity in our data is based on creativity skills learning new things anticipation and a right attitude towards food The creative practices of living with excess food bring joy to everyday life but however avoiding food waste also sometimes involves strict selfdiscipline All in all the selfforming activityaims to transform the food consumption process through different techniques of disrupting wasteful consumption practices However separating from food waste is also crucial for forming the ethical self Finally based on our analysis the telos of the ethical action is to become a responsible citizen in the CE Through the ethos of thrift the aim is to create a balanced relationship to the self others and the nature In contrast to those sampled in our data it is crucial to note that there are plenty of people who are not interested in transforming their practices into more sustainable ones This is problematic since the transition to a CE requires thatconsumers take the CE as their moral project It would also be important to research the practices of people who are not that concerned about the sustainabil ity issues of food consumption It is crucial to note that if we want to take seriously the moral complexity of everyday life we cannot assume the CE as a moral economy of simple rights and wrongs Thus we must consider that if we want to have a clear view of the CE wecannot perceive the role of citizens only through the acceptance or rejection of practices that have been designed on their behalf Hobson This is in lineLehtokunnas et al with Mylan et als notion that consumption in the home is far more com plex than securing the right ow of goods and disposing of the waste in the right way p Thus the discourse on the CE should not slip into moralizing and blaming overspending consumers Evans Instead of such sanctimony it is important to pay attention to the need for changes in political decisionmaking and our whole way of life Finally we want to present some possible policy implications related to food waste reduction and the implementation of the CE Political programmes such as the EUs CE Strategy mentioned in the Introduction section appear quite distant from the perspective of everyday life Thus more local initiatives to promote the CE are needed The leftover cooking workshop organized with the Finnish Martha Organization and food waste diaries that were used as research material in this article provide examples of this kind of local
