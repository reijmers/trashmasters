licence to springer nature switzerland ag abstract since the end of covid pandemic has affected countries and currently majority of the world is facing the wrath of the second wave one ofthe outcomes of the ongoing pandemic is the generation of huge amount of solidpolymeric covidwaste comprising medical waste personal protective equip ment ppe waste packaging waste and other household waste with potentialinfectious components residing on it thermochemical route is the preferred treatment and effective way of disposal of such infectious polymeric waste typically incineration is employed to ens ure complete destruction of the patho gens which is not a resourceefficient met hod pyrolysis is a sustainable alterna tive which can handle the present covidwaste stream in shortterm andlongterm yielding valuable fuel and mate rial products recently published liter ature in this avenue have clearly shown the versatility of this technology inefficiently handling both mono and mix ed stream of polymers based on facts we propose a resource resurgence framew ork that utilizes pyrolysis as the core conversion route for effectively handl ing covidwaste streams our framework suggests how these plants can be operational and helpful in generation of revenuein postpandemic times as well we expect that the conscientious adoption ofpyrolysis will certainly lead us towards a circular economy

affected coun tries and territories globally causing confirmed cases of infection and confirmed deaths as of th may in the beginning months of a state of emergency was announced worldwide and imposed forthwith by world health organisationwho as the primary measure of defence in an absolutely cureless situation who hasurged public health authorities in the respective affected countries to contain the spread of thevirus within social spheres as small as possible to disrupt the chain of transmission of theoutbreak the virus transmits through micromacro droplets produced during sneezing or coughing by an infected human personal protective equipment ppe such as masks gloves ppe wearable kits face shields and personal hygiene products like alcoholbasedsanitizers and surface sterilizers are the primary protections and commodities that werepromptly put to compulsory use by the nonhomebound people to minimize the risk ofinfection this led to a sudden and enormous upsurge in the use of ppes majorly in themedical and human transport sectors fast forward to may some vaccines have surfacedsuch as bntb by pfizerbiontech moderna by astrazeneca and covishield byserum institute of india mass vaccination is slowly taking pace and amidst this the world is experiencing the tsunami of the second wave with countries like india being highly affected these breakthroughs in vaccine development are commendable but recent concerns have emerged with the efficacy related to mutated variations of the virus despite all these the continual use and demand for the ppe are increasing exponentially as a result of their majorly singleuse nature the used and disposed ppes are adding up to the evergrowing piles of complex anthropogenic solid waste the overall composition of thesolid waste stream has changed strikingly during this pandemic situation fear and anxietyhave driven unnecessary stockpiling of food and groceries due to nationwide imposition of lockdown and consequent uncertainties have significantly altered the food waste generation dynamics considering the dry waste only several used masks gloves ppe empty sanitizerbottles used tissue papers and lots of packaging waste have increased in a typical urban waste stream generated in the metros and cities another contributor to the rise in the quantity of packaging waste is due to a steep increase in ecommerce shopping which hasbecome a habit during the lockdown periods and to some extent fear of contracting thecovid virus on the embarkment of the covid medical waste generation reached up to tons per day in wuhan city china whereas there was a increase in medical waste generation in malaysia by march to keep things simple we term these infectious wastes as covidwaste that includes medical waste ppe waste and other household waste with potential infectious components including discarded packaging wasteaccording to prata et al the global monthly demand of gloves was almost billion whereas for facemasks it was billion to tackle covid the daily usage of facemaskshas been estimated to be billion per day as estimated by hantoko et al north america generated nearly kilotons of medical waste followed by europe asia and southamerica with kilotons kilotons and kilotons respectively whereas africa and oceania are generating least amount of medical waste with kilotons and kilotons respectively based on facemasks only the demand in ppe kits is projected to increase by due to covid by who this article presents discussions on the ongoing thermochemical management efforts of covidwaste specifically focusing on conversioncircular economy and sustainabilitythrough pyrolysis and established a framework for highlighting the resource resurgence potential from the perspective of circular economy current scenario of covidwaste generation the rapidly changing composition is not only dictating a paradigm shift for the solid wastemanagement swm industry but also indicating the probability ofcrosscontaminationcontraction the extremely infectious sarscov virus can persist insurfaces of cardboard plastic and metals for hours to days as long as day survival isreported hence open dumping of covidwaste carelessly will directly lead to high health risk of groundlevel workers especially in developing nations where rag pickers and waste collectors are not well aware of the viral contraction and are not equipped with ppesthemselves there are several cases where workers in swm facilities have tested covidpositive due to crosscontamination an undismissible source of which may be the solidwastes this way the medical and domestic fractions of the covidinduced solid wastes produced globally are posing an ugly threat to the environment this biohazardladen plasticwaste must be treated through a green route to free the environment from this burden in anecofriendly manner and abiding by the global agenda of circular economy to contribute to sustainable waste management practices the commonly practiced plastic recycling and recovery methods were also affected by excessive ppe usage due to the covid pandemic which is strongly boosting environmental pollution as the ppes include plastics as key constituents the disposal of themwithout being recycled enhances the number of hazardous pollutants such as dioxins andtoxic metals in the environment due to the fast change of composition and characteristics of the generated waste authorities are finding it difficult to cope up as the built infrastructuresare not yet fully adapted and upscaled to efficiently handle such huge volume of ppe waste the wrath of the second wave of the ongoing pandemic has increased the generation of packaging materials and other medical things the generation rate is expected to increase by and respectively due to higher demand of ppe kits and online food andessentials delivery in the healthcare sector the demand of different commodities such as face shields gloves trash bags and masks also increases the demand of different types ofpolymers such as polypropylene pp polyvinylchloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet which are also creating huge amount of plastic waste additionally with the second wave the demands of online grocery and food delivery services have increased while the business giants are trying to seize the opportunity the resulting waste streams are contributing to more and more covidwaste available practices for covidwaste management covidwaste is infectious and biohazardous which needs to be disposed in a controlledenvironment of thermal treatment to destroy any living pathogen as the volume of waste surges up existing capacity of waste treatment may not be enough which will call for new facility establishment an intelligent alternative is to utilize the existing msw incinerators as proposed by united nation environment programme unep steam sterilization and microwaving are the two most preferred technologies whereas the incineration of differentcircular economy and sustainabilitycategories are the secondary preferred incineration does kill the pathogens and ensures that all toxic compounds are completely decomposed however it is neither resourceefficient nor an ecofriendly technology in developing countries like india the increasing amount of packaging waste plastics such as polypropylene pp lowdensity polyethylene ldpe highdensity polyethylene hdpe polyethylene terephthalate petand polystyrene ps are creating massive pressure in open dumping yards and landfill sitesdiscarded materials including contaminated face masks gloves and ppes can aggravateenvironmental and health problems particularly in countries like india where the solid wastemanagement system is still in the developing phase and yet to attain a fully dedicated stagewithin the whole chain of waste disposal to recycling biodegradation of plastic waste is still a lingering challenge and only few early laboratory scale reports are available hence it cannot be adopted as a measure to treat and manage the highly recalcitrant covidwaste the most common approach to the present covidwastestream is to incinerate combustion the waste regarding the ease of operation incineration isused as an onsite treatment of the covidwaste which is not so easy with other options like land filling however incineration is not a resourceefficient approach of waste management as it is a route for direct destruction not recoveryrecycling incineration is also adverselycriticized for its huge carbon footprint produced from any type of solid waste biomass andplastic being combusted keeping in view the huge volume of the covidwastes inciner ation should be deemed unsuitable as a primary option for treatment pyrolysis a promising resource resurgence route for covidwaste the joint agenda of implementing circular economy and sustainability in all future waste management systems calls for an efficient and suitable technology for covidwaste handling pyrolysis will serve as an alternative and arguably a sustainable technology to handle the present covidwaste stream in short term and long term compared to incineration pyrolysis is reported to be an ecofriendlier and resourceefficient process as a wellknown green engineering approach pyrolysis has long been adopted for recyclingmultiple types of solid waste including both biomass and plastic wastes definitively pyrolysis is the decomposition of feedstock in the absence of oxygen which produces usefulproducts ie pyroliquid pyrogas and pyrochar or solid residue despite production of solidliquid and gaseous products pyrolysis is majorly used for production of the liquid oil part due to the usefulness of all the products and their collection for further use unlike inciner ation no product stream is directly open to the environment which makes it a green process it is reported by multiple previous studies that oil fraction reaches the maximum among allpyroproducts when plastic or synthetic polymeric materials are used as feedstock operating temperature of pyrolysis plays the key role in the yield of maximum liquid or gasvia the pyrolysis process having a typical range of k configuration of the pyrolysis reactor and use of catalyst also have pronounced effects and need to be considered for betterproduct yield different kinds of plastic wastes including a considerable amount of packaging plastics being produced during this pandemic period can be directly converted into fuel via pyrolysis without segregation it is a very important fact for the covidwaste that at their site of generation they are appearing as a relatively source segregated waste due to the presence of contagious virus which makes it unmixable with other wastes segregatedwaste is always best for maximum resource recovery many researchers confirm thatcircular economy and sustainabilitypyrolysis of waste plastics yields significant quantity of oil more than wt of feedstock hence it is very well documented that pyrolysis process is considered as an effective and ecofriendly route for handling and converting the plastic or polymeric wastes to useful products since a long time therefore in the context of the present article the experimental case studies using covidinduced polymeric wastes having similar composition as thepyrolysis feedstocks have been selectively highlighted to indicate its adoption as an efficienttreatment technology in table the information from latest articles reporting experimental studies on the pyrolysis of the polymeric wastes generated at excessively high rates during theoutbreak of covid pandemic are presented the effectiveness of pyrolysis process indifferent countries of the world for sustainable disposal of covid wastes along withrecovery of valuable resources is tabulated from the data represented in table i tc a nb e observed that a good quantity of liquid fuel rich in several hydrocarbon compounds was obtained from the pyrolysis of different polymeric wastes in the form of pyrooil which can beused as an alternative source of energy as a blendin additive the pyrogas is also identified asan energyrich product of pyrolysis however use of catalyst may help to bring down the optimum temperature required for the pyrolysis process there are specific effects of temperature as well as the catalyst on theproduct distribution finetuning of these factors controls the percentage of aromatics and other desired chemicals in the pyrooil and its fuel value calorific value or higher heating value over the last decade numerous research articles investigated and reported effect of several parameters of pyrolysis of different types of polymeric plastics pp ldpe hdpepet and ps on the production of pyrooil this will drive the adoption of pyrolysis as an efficient covidwaste management and recycling method and constructionof dedicated pyrolysis plants for the said purpose the generated pyrooil are used as analternative fuel in gas turbines generators and boiler systems the fuel value of obtained distilled pyrooil of packaging waste pp ldpe and hdpe was close to diesel with longhydrocarbon chains c which confirms the robustness of the technology the gaseous or noncondensable part which evolved due to pyrolysis can be fed back for partial table resource recovery from
