Technology NTNU Trondheim Norway bOstfold Research Stadion Krkery Norway ARTICLE INFO Keywords Organic waste treatmentFood waste preventionRecycling rates Energy e ciency Avoided greenhouse gas emissionsABSTRACT Waste amounts are growing with increasing wealth and population To curb this trend and reduce adverse environmental impacts food waste reduction has been sat on the political agenda together with ambitious material recycling and greenhouse gas GHG emissions targets This study analyses the environmental bene ts of two waste management systems for household organic food waste namely recycling by anaerobic digestion AD and incineration Recycling rates energy eciency andGHG emissions are reviewed to determine the environmental pro le of the downstream systems The avoided GHG emissions achieved by the respective waste management strategies are further compared with the ones achieved by food waste prevention strategies The study combines a material ow analysis MFA assessing the downstream system with published life cycle analysis LCA results for the upstream system The method wasdemonstrated as a proofofconcept case study for the city of Trondheim Norway It was found that the recycling of food waste with AD performs better in terms of recycling rates and GHG emissions than incineration provided that diesel is substituted by biogas However the energy eciency of the incineration process was found to be slightly higher than of the AD option Nonetheless relatively small re ductions in food wastage and resulted in large amounts of avoided emissions outweighing thebenets of recycling strategies For mitigating climate change the prevention of food waste clearly stood out as the most e ective strategy Norwegian authorities should focus equally much on household food waste pre vention than on optimising food waste management systems Introduction The European Unions approach to waste management is currently based on two main pillars On the one hand the Waste Framework Directive EC Article favours waste prevention over reuse followed by recycling energy recovery and nally disposal European Commission On the other hand the Circular Economy package adopted by European Commission in advocates an economic system thatleaves no waste to be land lled and that keeps all material ows in the economy through reuse redesign material recovery or energy recoveryEuropean European Commission Two main elements are in troduced the land ll ban on speci c waste fractions such as organic waste and speci c collection and recycling targets for the various waste fractions Several European cities have in the context of a circular economy recently implemented source sorting of household organic waste as thisfraction contains high energy and nutrient levels and has a high potential for recovery Environmental and economic bene ts have hence led European authorities to focus on organic waste recycling and tolargely invest in biogas facilities resulting in Europe now being the worlds leading producer of biogas Hamilton et al Scarlat et al Anaerobic digestion AD converts waste into biogas and di gestate which can be used to produce electricity heat fuel and soil amendment products Bernstad and la Cour Jansen Bernstad Saraiva Schott and Andersson Khalid Arshad Anjum Mahmood and Dawson Modahl et al Scarlat Previous studies have

has only lately been recognized as apriority area both at an international European and Norwegian level Sustainable Development Goal SDG number sat the topic on the agenda in by aiming at halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along the production and supply chains including postharvest losses In Europe food waste reduction has become one of the priority areas in theCircular Economy package adopted in In Norway an agreement between the government and the food industry was concluded in June aiming at reducing food waste by by Klima og miljdepartementet These resolutions are of importance as food waste is in fact a huge challenge Approximately one third of the food produced worldwide is wasted throughout the supply chain representing loss of resources consumed such as water land energy and labour FAO of the total Norwegian household food consumption is wastedStensgrd and Hanssen of which two thirds are avoidable food products Bernstad and Andersson Bjrnerud and Syversen Syversen Hanssen and Bratland Vanham Bouraoui Leip Grizzetti and Bidoglio estimated that as much as the European food waste can be classi ed as avoidable Food waste hence indirectly causes large environmental damages inaddition to the direct impacts of waste treatment at disposal and therefore give rise to ethical social and economic concerns The pre vention of food waste can remedy to several of these aspects Eberle and Fels Salhofer Obersteiner Schneider and Lebersorger UNEP however prevention measures have until now receivedfar less attention than waste treatment and recovery measures Few previous studies have compared the environmental bene ts of food waste prevention with the ones of various waste handling solu tions for several indicators This comparison has been partly covered by Bernstad and Andersson who concluded based on LCA metho dology that food waste minimization strategies result in far greaterbenets for global warming compared to both incineration and AD This supports the conclusions presented by Matsuda Yano Hirai and Sakai Further Hamilton et al concluded using MFA methodology that food waste minimization strategies result in greaterenergy saving potential compared to food waste recycling strategies There is little literature on this topic and since the Circular Economy package seems to focus mostly on recovery and recycling strategies while the waste hierarchy and overall policy should give highest priority to prevention this limited knowledge is seen as a problem This study aims at analysing the performance of these two re spective strategies transition to a circular economy and waste pre vention for the case of food waste based on three relevant indicators in the light of CE recycling rates energy e ciency and generated avoided GHG emissions For capturing these three indicators which areclosely interlinked we use a multilayer MFA framework to model the waste management system The upstream production system en vironmental impacts and downstream waste management system impacts are linked by mass balance principles and CO calculations by coupling the MFA results with LCA literature for assessing the avoidedemissions indicator The methodology is demonstrated by a proofofconcept study for the city of Trondheim representing a typical Norwegian city The functional unit is based on a food waste composition analysis for this city The conclusions drawn from this study can be applied to other European cities facing the same waste management situation Methodology This study aims at analysing the performance of two respective strategies the transition to a circular economy and waste prevention for the case of food waste based on three relevant indicators For doing so the downstream and upstream systems are modelled separately The downstream model is developed using material ow analysis MFA methodology extended with energy and emission data for assessingrecycling rates energy e ciencies and emission levels for two di erent recycling systems The upstream model calculates CO emission from the food production system using data from LCA studies in literature Both models are tailored to t the current food waste situation and the actual plans for the city of Trondheim with the system as reference and alternative scenarios in and as comparisons This methodology is a proofofconcept The full MFA model is pre sented in SI Dierent de nitions and terms are found in literature when it comes to food wastage These should be de ned precisely as they are used in this paper to avoid any confusion Note that neither the de nitions nor the scope of the study does not include packaging Food waste is any food and inedible parts of food removed from the food supply chain to be recovered or disposed including com posted crops ploughed innot harvested anaerobic digestion bio energy production cogeneration incineration disposal to sewer landll or discarded to sea stergren et al Avoidable food waste refers to materials that could have been eaten making no distinction between what is elsewhere called possibly avoidable orpreference loss eg peels seeds Moreover food which has passed its byuse date is also considered as avoidable as the consumer could have planned more e ectively stergren et al Unavoidable food waste refers to materials that could not have been eaten under normal circumstances for instance bones and orange peels stergren et al Food waste prevention are measures taken before a substance ma terial or product has become waste that reduce a the quantity of waste including through the reuse of products or the extension of the life span of products b the adverse impacts of the generated waste on the environment and human health or c the content of harmful substances in materials and products European Commission Case study description As of Trondheim had ca inhabitants SSB plus some students with another formal home address and is thereby the third largest city in Norway A large share of the waste is today incinerated with heat recovery feeding into a district heat net work that serves of the space heating demand of the citys build ings This provides annually some GWh heat supply of which ca energy from waste and the remaining from peak load energy sources Bratteb and Reenaas Lausselet et al Varme Currently paper plastic glass metal and residual waste are the fractions sorted out from households There are three main collection technologies surface bins represent the bins on wheel that are placed in front of each household underground receptacles represent containers usually placed at a central point in an urban area and serve multiple households and vacuum systems that are either stationary or mobile These currently collect and of the household waste respectively The two latter technologies are underground systems which together aim at reaching a collection capacity of by Hence organic waste is currently not sorted out or treated independently but is sent to incineration in the residual waste fraction The city adminis tration however today investigates the possibilities for building a central sorting facility including the use of near infrared technologyI de Sadeleer et al Resources Conservation Recycling aimed at sorting out organic waste for biogas production and plastic waste for increased ratios of material recycling Trondheim kommune Data acquisition A composition analysis was conducted to estimate the avoidable food waste amounts contained in household waste in Trondheim Wastesamples of kg from ve dierent residential areas were col lected re ecting the socialdemographic di erences of the city This was important as it has been shown that the food waste amounts di er with factors such as age sex wages and time consumption on foodpreparation Stensgrd Prestrud Jrgen Og and Callewaert The residual waste was rst divided into nonfood waste and food waste The food waste was subsequently categorized as avoidable and unavoidable as recommended by Lebersorger and Schneider andBernstad and Cnovas Eight avoidable fractions were dis tinguished fruits and vegetables bread and bakeries sh meat dairy products eggs meal leftovers and other usable products as advocated by the Norwegian national handbook for composition analyses For three of the sampling areas the meal leftover fraction was further classied into the categories of bread sh and meat and others in order to get an indication of the amounts of carbonintensive products presentin that speci c fraction A composition vector was developed based on the average of the areas representing the share of unavoidable and avoidable and food waste fractions divided on the speci c fractions Table Based on weight the meal leftover fraction was found to be the most importantfraction of avoidable food waste followed by fruits and vege tables and bread and pastries However the uncertainties linked to the analysis are likely to be signicant due to errors that occurred during the outsorting process As the results are based on the fraction weight incorrect outsorting ofheavy products or the inclusion of packaging in uence the results Nonetheless the results are comparable to the ones presented in theliterature and therefore considered acceptable for the purpose of this study Bernstad and Casanovas present a graph compiling the available food waste fractions results across the literature It is di cult to compare in detail the di erent studies as the classi cation of the food fractions di er across the studies a ecting the percentagebased results However the fruits and vegetable share nearly always the largest most often followed by bread and pastries andor prepared food In some studies the categories diary and others were also sig nicant The study of Stensgrd and Hanssen was not included in that overview but the division of the categories and hence the results are comparable to this study Their result present that the meal leftover fraction was the most important fraction of the avoidable food waste followed by fruits and vegetables and bread Understanding the composition of the food waste is a rst step for proposing targeted and e cient reduction solutions Downstream system The system boundaries are twofold the upstream and the down stream system Fig The rst one representing the food production system is described in The system boundaries of the downstreamsystem include the municipal household waste system for managing organic waste The system boundaries start with the collection of waste from the households The waste is transported either directly to the incineration facility or to a central sorting facility In the second option the waste is after further sorting in the central sorting facility either directed to a biogas facility or to the incineration plant The incinera tion process produces heat which is used for district heating purposes and ashes which are disposed of The biological treatment produces biogas which is used as fuel and digestate which is used as fertilizers as it recovers nitrogen and phosphorus System boundary description Model description Upstream system Following the MFA modelling principles of Brunner and Rechberger the model A generic municipal solid waste man agement model developed at NTNU Callewaert was adapted and applied to the organic waste system of the municipality of Trond heim see SI The massbalanced mathematical model analyses the resource and emission ows in the system using three di erent system ow layers for this system de nition First a material layer quanti es the annual ows of goods on a waste fractions level in the system Second an energy layer evaluates the associated ows of energy for each process in the system Finally an emission layer estimates GHG emissions as CO eq from processes transport and energy consumption Due to the dependency between the layers it is possible to examine how changes in the material ows as a consequence of system changes over time will inuence the systemwide energy and emission performance Therst layer calculates all material ows based on given waste ows quantities on the composition vector and on known or assumed transfer coe cients for each process A transfer coe cient in MFA theory determines how much of the sum of in ows to a given process is directed to a speci c outow direction Transfer coe cients hence tell how e cient a process is in directing the waste through ow in the desired downstream direction The calculated material ows are used to estimate the energy ows entering and leaving the system The energy e ciency of the system is calculated by dividing the energy generated in incineration and biogasproduction with the feedstock energy from the waste and the con sumption of energy from waste treatment processes and transport ac tivities This is used as an indicator for assessing the overall energy performance of the system The emission layer calculates the generated GHG emissions based on the results from the material and energy layer The emissions in cluded are caused by waste collection and transport energy consump tion during waste treatment processes and direct emissions from AD and incineration Emissions caused by the life cycle of infrastructure are excluded The emission factors are presented in SI Additionally avoided emissions are calculated based on the quan tity of energy outputs calculated in the energy layer of the model Onthe one hand heat generated from the incineration process is assumed to replace electricity as heating source in households thanks to district heating in Trondheim On the other hand biogas from the AD is as sumed to substitute diesel in transport For the substituted products the amounts of energy generated are multiplied with the emission factors ofTable Composition vector of the reference scenario Waste fractions Waste composition kgcap Bread and pastries Fruits and vegetables Meat Fish Dairy Other usable products Eggs Meal leftovers Unavoidable food waste Total I de Sadeleer et al Resources Conservation Recycling electricity kgCO eqkWh ecoinvent and diesel kgCO eqkWh ecoinvent representing avoided emissions and therefore with negative values System boundary description Both the food supply chain and the waste management system are essential in the environmental assessment of food waste prevention Bernstad and Cnovas The upstream system depicting the food supply chain quanti es the embedded emissions of food commodities in a cradletogate perspective The system boundaries of the upstream system follow the ones of Clune et al Fig At the farm inputs from chemicals and fertilizers fuel and energyinputs from irrigation and machinery for cultivation harvesting and processing are included In addition transport and distribution to the regional distribution centre are part of the analysis Outputs include emissions released from fertilized soils plants and animals on the elds The infrastructure however is not included It should be noted that the use phase which includes how consumers travel to shops store and cook food is not included in the analysis Infact the aim of the study is to quantify the impacts of di erent political strategies which are out of reach for consumers If a share of theavoidable food waste is properly prevented from being wasted at the household level it can be assumed that the in ow of food commodities to the household is equally reduced Consequently it can be consideredthat the same amount of food commodities is avoided from being produced and that the associated productionrelated emissions are Fig Food chain system divided on upstream and downstream systems Fig System boundaries of the upstream system Source Clune et al I de Sadeleer et al Resources Conservation Recycling avoided simultaneously This analysis hence neglects the environmental impacts arising at the household level Model description Clune et al performed a metaanalysis of LCA studies published between and from which they created a GHG emission database for a large quantity of food products In this study the embedded GHG emissions of the di erent avoidable food waste fractions were calculated Table by aggregating the median GWP values of the appropriate food products presented by Clune et al The emissions were then multiplied with the composition vector in percent giving the amount of CO eq embedded in one kilo of avoidable food waste with the typical composition of the food wasted by households in Trondheim This composition was used as reference composi tion It is unlikely however that all food fractions will be equally re duced by prevention measures The change within the various fractions therefore follows the results of the ForMat project Stensgrd and Hanssen Two composition analyses were conducted in an in terval of years in the Norwegian city of Fredrikstad and in the Hal lingdal valley During this period food waste prevention measures were actively established The di erence in food wastage between the two analyses was concluded to be a consequence of these measures Thechange in shares within the composition vector in the various projec tions is subject to high uncertainty but is the only available data in a Norwegian waste prevention context Table presents the new com position vector e ected by food waste prevention measures The production of the unavoidable food waste fraction is equal for all scenarios and projections and was therefore left out of this study assuggested by MartinezSanchez Tonini Mller and Astrup Following the same approach as Bernstad and Andersson only the avoidable food waste is prevented For calculating the embedded emissions from the meal leftover fraction its composition had to be estimated During the composition analysis the meal leftovers were classied in three categories bread sh and meat and others Based on the fraction weight it was estimated that of the meal leftover wasconstituted of bread and pastries of sh and meat and of a mixture of all other fractions mainly others and fruits and vegetablesThe amount of embedded GHG emissions of this fraction was estimated in accordance with this allotment The emissions embedded in one kilo of avoidable food waste with the reference composition amounted to kg CO eqkg avoidable wasted food In comparison the emissions released for producing onekilo of avoidable food waste with the prevention composition amountedto kg CO eqkg avoidable wasted food These results are in line with the literature Bernstad and Cnovas The di erence be tween these two values ie kg CO eqkg represents the change in upstream emissions if the waste composition is altered through prevention activities It can be noted that the embedded emissions of one kilo avoidable food waste increase as the amounts of avoidable food waste is reduced which is explained by a reduction of the lowcarbonintensive product share bread and pastries but a stagnation in the high carbonintensive product share meat sh dairy products Scenario development This study compares main scenarios for the years and a Reference scenario RS a Central sorting scenario CS and aPrevention scenario PS Reference scenario RS describes the current waste management solutions in Trondheim in and assumes these solutions are used towards Organic waste is collected together with the residual waste and sent to incineration for district heating Projections for and account for increased population and thereby increased food waste amounts The share of collection technologies is adjusted with time with aboveground bins decreasing to and for the and projections respectively and the underground receptacles and vacuum systems increasing to and and to and respectively The collection technology in uences the energy require ment of the collection process The share of biodiesel used in transportis assumed to rise to in and to in The LHV of food waste is estimated at kJkg for fruits and vegetables kJkg forsh and meat Christensen and kJkg for all other fractions Hung and Solli The amount of organic waste per in habitant was calculated based on historic organic waste generation data from and which show a slight increase over the years A linear regression was applied and lead to the following kg in kg in and kg in which were used as reference scenarios for the di erent years Central sorting scenario CS examines the e ects of a new central sorting facility separating organic waste and di erent plastic waste fractions with optical sorting and nearinfrared technologies Central sorting facilities are promoted as important technological tools for increasing collection and hence recycling rates Variants of this technology are currently spreading as stateoftheart waste manage ment practice in Norway and is therefore of importance to examine more closely Based on data from a similar facility at ROAF outside Oslo the organic waste separation e ciency of the facility is set to which re ects the performance of the currently existing tech nologies Callewaert Half of the household food waste is thus directed to the incineration plant together with other waste fractionswhile the successfully outsorted second half is sent to AD for biogas production in Verdal km outside Trondheim The methane yield of food waste is assumed to be Nmt Hung and Solli Ac cording to the citys plans the central sorting facility will not be inoperation before and is therefore only modelled for this year The collection technologies the share of transport fuel and the LHV of the food waste fractions are equal to those assumptions used in the RS scenario Prevention scenario PS investigates the consequences of pre vention measures which decrease the amounts of avoidable food waste in and with and respectively The measures themselves are not de ned only the e ects of reduced avoidable food waste amounts are analysed These e ects of prevention are applied also to the CS scenarios in a combined PSCS scenario The collection technologies the share of transport fuel and the LHV of the food waste fractions are equal to the assumptions used in the RS scenario Like for the reference scenarios the amount of organic waste per inhabitant for the prevention scenarios were calculated based on historical data on which a linear regression was applied This lead to the following kg in including reduction kg in including reduction and kg in including reduc tion Sensitivity analysis A

variables and assumptions are deliberately changed one at a time to analyse how they a ect the outcome of the modelling The changes in results are measured through the sensitivity ratio SR which is thefraction of relative change in the results R over the relative change in the input parameter P Sandberg et al SRRR PP p The sensitivity analysis was only performed on the main parameters of the MFA system in uencing the three layers The analysis was performed for the CS scenario of as this would allow a comparisonof the parameters in uencing both the AD and the incineration pro cesses Results The results are threefold according to the three assessed indicators material recycling energy e ciency and emission levels Regarding recycling rates there is a common understanding in the EU that these must be increased in a circular economy In addition to producing biogas a biogas facility also creates biorest which recycles nitrogen and phosphorus The analysed biogas facility uses a dewa tering system which leads to the nitrogen leaving the biorest stream Only phosphorus is then recycled as fertilizer However the biogas facility under study has done tests regarding the use of liquid biorest which would allow a recovery of the nitrogen in addition to the recovery of phosphorus Ecopro Regardless of the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus recycled the European Commission de nes in the waste legislation that all inputs to the AD facility are considered material recycled if the digestate is used as fertilizer in agriculture European Commission This means that the scenarios using AD obtain increased recycling rates compared to theRS as long as the digestate is used as fertilizers As a result CS and PSCS scenarios reach material recycling for the food waste fraction on the account that half of the waste is treated with AD In comparison the RS scenario obtains no material recycling as the total waste amounts are incinerated The net energy generation for the three scenarios at all points in time are presented in Fig together with the disaggregated con sumption and generation factors The net generation yellow bars isthe result of the energy generated as biogas and district heating green bars minus the energy consumption in transport and processing blue bars Given increased waste amounts the energy consumption and gen eration are slightly increased over time Not surprisingly the preven tion scenario at all times displays lower e ciencies compared to the RS scenarios because reduced waste amounts lead to reductions in consumed and recovered energy For all scenarios except the CS scenario the process energy con sumption is largely dominant over the transport energy consumption It is higher in the CS scenario because of the long transport distances to the biogas facility Even if AD is capable of recovering slightly higher energy amounts than incineration CS and PSCS scenarios compared to the RS and PS in the net energy generation is slightly decreased due to the long transport distances The amounts of generated and avoided emissions are presented in Fig for the three scenarios at all points in time The bars on the upper side of the graph present the amounts of generated emissions whereasthe bars on the lower side represent the avoided emissions The PS scenario and the PSCS scenario clearly demonstrates the largest amounts of avoided emissions across all scenarios Theprevention of food waste green bars has undoubtedly the highest impact as climate mitigation strategy The substitution of diesel with biogas dark blue bars also leads toavoided emissions as does the substitution of electricity with district heating light blue bars although to a lesser extent As diesel has a much higher emission factor than electricity its substitution highly increases the amounts of avoided emissions Nonetheless both sub stitution options result in far less avoided emissions than the prevention of food waste The bene ts of fertilizer substitution with digestate was neglected The avoided emissions outweigh the generated emissions in all scenarios except in the current PS scenario This latter is explained bythe fact that the composition of the food waste arising with the in u ence of prevention measures include more carbonintensive productsThe prevention activities in the current RS are hence resulting in higher levels of GHG emissions as the change in the share of fractions out weighs the bene ts of reduction in waste amounts The amounts of generated emissions are higher in the CS and PS CS scenarios due to the increase of transport related emissions yellow bars compared to the RS and the PS scenarios Only small emissions are released by the incineration process orange bars and the recycling process red bars To analyse the robustness of the results a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the most important parameters Table The food waste separation e ciency of the central sorting facility was analysed in terms of how it in uences the system recycling and energy e ciencies As expected an e cient food waste outsorting in the central sorting facility is crucial for improving the system recycling e ciency How ever it turns out to only slightly in uence reduce the system energy eciency The energy e ciency is in fact much more in uenced by changes in the methane yield and the LHV of other food waste frac tions Regarding emission levels the emission factor for diesel used in transport was found to be very sensitive as most of the waste truck eet is fuelled on diesel Discussion This chapter rst discusses the results and assumptions used in the study Second the limitations of the methodology are reviewed The system boundaries in this study exclude the household level with storage in refrigerators and food preparation As the meal leftover fraction stands for the largest share of avoidable food waste its pre vention would also in uence the amount of energy consumed Further the study did not account for the rebound e ect As households spend less on food when food waste is prevented the environmental impacts might be reallocated with spending on other products This aspect should be taken into account for a holistic environmental policy de velopment Comparing avoided emissions from improved waste management systems with the ones obtained from food waste prevention o er in sights in the environmental potential of upstream versus downstreamclimate change mitigation strategies In that regard prevention strate gies clearly result in larger bene ts than recycling strategies re duction in avoidable food waste gave more than times larger bene ts than what was obtained with improved recycling strategies in the CS scenario It must be noted that these conclusions are based on the as sumption that a reduction in food waste leads to a reduction of food production Avoided emission from the food production process was hence the determining factor for the overall bene ts of food waste prevention as observed also by Bernstad and Andersson Gentil Gallo and Christensen andMatsuda et al There is however a risk that the amount of food waste prevented at thehousehold level will arise higher up in the food chain eg at the retailor production level Such a shift in waste production will hence not prevent any GHG emissions it is then necessary to have good waste management recycling systems in place and therefrom avoid emissionsthrough substituting carbon intensive products Combining prevention measures and a switch to AD would none theless o er optimal solutions for food waste management based onI de Sadeleer et al Resources Conservation Recycling the analysed indicators It must be noted that the AD process depends on food waste as feedstock Investing in a biogas facility will create amarket for the food waste and might therefore not incentivize the prevention and reduction of food waste at the household level Further analysing the di erences between the RS and CS scenarios excluding the upstream prevention results allows for a comparison of the performance of the household food wastemanagement systems for the three assessed indicators First in accordance with the de nition of the EU European Commission AD is the only treatment option re sulting in material recycling The sensitivity analysis disclosed that theeectiveness of the central sorting facility is a crucial parameter highly aecting the recycling rate Optionally organic waste can be collected in separate bins and directly transported to a biogas facility avoiding Fig Energy consumption generation and net energy consumption for all scenarios Fig Total emissions generated and avoided in kg CO eq for all scenariosI de Sadeleer et al Resources Conservation Recycling the diversion through a central sorting facility Based on the experi ences from ROAF this would reduce the contamination of the other waste fractions especially paper and plastics allowing for overall higher recycling rates Callewaert Unander Second it is bene cial to recover the feedstock energy present in food waste as the generated energy amounts largely outweigh con sumed energy across all scenarios Even though the AD process gen erates slightly more energy than the incineration process the CS sce nario requires higher energy amounts because of the longer driving distance to the biogas facility causing the total energy e ciency to decrease The LHV and especially the methane yield were found to bequite sensitive parameters The latter was assumed to be slightly overestimated Hung and Solli which might have given too high energy amounts generated for the AD process However the biogasfacility in the case study operates with codigestion a feedstock mix consisting of sewage sludge organic household waste and sh sludge This mix delivers higher amounts of biogas than if only organic wastewas used as input Edwards et al Therefore the methane yield in use is higher than if only food waste would have been digested Inaddition it should be taken into account that the energy recovery from incineration can easily be connected to a heat or electricity grid In comparison biogas and fertilizers from digestate are not necessarily convenient to use without any infrastructural changes and due to pre mature markets or policy constraints This might lead to the results of the study being more theoretical than practically implementable Third when comparing generated emissions with avoided emis sions it is clear that the avoided emissions outweigh the generated onesin all scenarios Nonetheless the net bene t of the CS scenario is times greater than of the RS scenario From an emission perspective itis hence bene cial to treat food waste by AD rather than by incinera tion even though the generated emissions are larger in the CS scenarioIt can be concluded that substituting diesel is more advantageous than substituting electricity It must be noted that the Norwegian electricity mix was applied in uencing the results by its low carbonintensity This assumption in uences the di erence between the scenario results more than it would if the Nordic or European electricity mix had been applied In addition the sensitivity analysis disclosed that both the emission factors for diesel and electricity were in uential especially the latter one which might also contribute to overestimate the lowemissions of the CS scenario Additionally the avoided emissions of the CS scenario would have been increased if the substation of fertilizers with digestate had been included The emission factor for diesel is rather in uential on overall emis sion results This can explain the high values of the transport process in the CS scenario where driving distance is decisive An option for re ducing the consumed energy amounts would be to either have a nearer location of the AD facility to fuel the trucks entirely on biogas or an other type of carbon neutral fuel or to transport the waste by train The methodology in use has clear limitations The presented MFA model is more appropriate for modelling complex waste management systems with several waste fractions The downstream indicators giverelatively straightforward results for the analysed scenarios but thelinks between them are not always obvious The MFA system con sistently allows analysing these tradeo s but is not used to its full potential when applied to this simpli ed system In addition the analysis would have been strengthened by a cost benet analysis However the literature shows that using food waste for biogas production is socioeconomically pro table compared to in cineration NIRAS Randby Therefore Norwegian au thorities have proposed a regulation on the sorting of food waste from households Miljdirektoratet In this regard a costbene t analysis comparing di erent treatment methods of food waste would not have political in uence as the question has already been debated upon In the European context the same argumentation yields becausethe Circular Economy Package requires higher amounts of recycled materials which can only obtained for food waste with biogas produc tion the cost would not have a real in uence A costbene t of pre vention measures compared to recycling measures would however beenof interest and is suggested as further research In the authors eyes the most interesting result is the comparison of the avoided emissions obtained by the upstream and various down stream strategies It can be argued that an LCA would have been a more robust and appropriate methodology for analysing this question The aim of this study was however to analyse di erent indicators for the downstream system in the context of a transition to a circular economyand compare the energy and emission performance with the potential upstream energy and emission savings For this aim we view the presented methodology as robust One should be cautious in applying the actual values presented in the results chapter Due to the uncertainties introduced with the com position analysis this study only aims at ranking the performance of the various strategies and reveal critical parameters that in uence the overall performance level Conclusion The environmental bene ts of household food waste prevention were compared to the bene ts from various waste management stra tegies in regard to recycling rates energy e ciency and emission e ciency using MFA methodology combined with published LCA results The method was demonstrated as a proofofconcept case study for the city of Trondheim Norway In a reference scenario food waste is treated together with residual waste and sent to incineration A central sorting facility is introduced in a central sorting scenario aiming at out sorting parts of the household food waste for use as feedstock in biogas production A food waste prevention scenario was also tested considering the e ects of a reduction of and avoidable food waste in and respectively The most e ective food waste management strategy seems to be a combination of prevention and recycling strategies On the one handfocus should primarily be on prevention strategies for mitigating cli mate change The developed scenarios only considered a smallTable Sensitivity analysis Parameters Recycling e ciency SR Energy e ciency

future CO emissions On the other hand emphasis should be placed on the use of AD for biogas production as the future waste recycling option This waste management system would mitigate re source depletion as it highly increases the recycling rates and would lower the emissions compared to the current incineration process in use One should be cautious in applying the actual values presented in the results chapter Due to the uncertainties introduced with the com position analysis this study only aims at ranking the performance of the various strategies and reveal critical parameters that in uence the overall performance level Even if prevention measures have been identi ed their e ects and environmental bene ts are considered di cult to quantify Salhofer et al and are therefore seldom examined Gentil et al Further research on the topic is needed to successfully reduce the amounts of avoidable food waste especially at the household level
