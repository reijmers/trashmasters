Circular economy a b s t r a c t Transition towards a more sustainable society is a complex task The depletion of natural resources and waste generation cannot be sustained indenitely ie as waste increases local landlls keep growing and land availability reduces The introduction of circular economy in effective household solid waste manage ment practices should be considered especially for third world countries such as Ecuador In this context plastic recycling is an important step particularly the case of expanded polystyrene containers that cur rently are singleuse only and later end up in local landlls This paper presents a methodology for recy cling Expanded Polystyrene by means of a case study from an Ecuadorian Plastic Manufacturer First the manufacture of resin from postconsume EPS containers was demonstrated possible by the manufacturer Second results show that using of postconsume resin in the mix produce satisfactory laboratory results and operational recycled

distribution and delivery of singleuse plastics Within this ordinance the manufacturers of singleuse EPS items must change the formula in their process to a new formula or product agreeing with any of the following options products are biodegradable of total product mass comes from recy cled materials and using other reusable materials in the lapse of months Ecuador Autonomous Decentralized Government Mu nicipality of Guayaquil In concordance with the local ordi nance are international regulations that the country needs to ac complish For example in July the Associated States of the Pacic Alliance from which Ecuador is a new member referred to the importance of developing new policies to promote the integral management of waste and reducing the production of singleuse plastics Ecuador Autonomous Decentralized Government Munici pality of Guayaquil Importantly Guayaquil is the city with highest plastic manufac turing according to the Ecuadorian Plastic Associantion ASEPLAS of the companies nationwide are localted in this impor tant and this single industry generates more than direct and indirect jobs Magazine Furthermore nation wide EPS container manufacturers do not comply with any of the three choices the city hall ordinance has set as acceptable This is the main reason why EPS item producer s opinion is that the local ordinance could harm the industry in its production processes and risk the stability of many workers Thus the following question arises what strategy should plastic manufacturing companies follow to survive in this new local eco friendly environment One contributing solution is shifting from a linear economy to a circular economy in singleuse items production by means of reusing and recycling expanded polystyrene products Manufactur ers already reuse their scrap as part of their production process between to so if they add postconsume resin as raw ma terial they could achieve the recycled material objective set by the municipality This study focuses in giving feasible options to the singleuse plastic manufacturers to redesign their products so they can in crease the use of recycled postconsume material applying the concept of circular economy to strengthen their competitiveness and supporting resource sustainability For this purpose the linear typical economy and circular econ omy proposal set by the authors are presented in the methodology Section The process description to obtain the recycled resin from postconsume containers effectuated by the manufacturer is then presented Production of new recycled containers and labo ratory test values are presented in the results Section Finally conclusions and discussion are presented in Sectons and Methodology The prevailing linear economic system in local plastic manufac turers accumulates waste while depleting natural resources Limi tations of natural resources and a growing world population have set the idea of a circular economy in the focus of research industry and politics in recent years Spierling et al Fig Linear economy EPS cycle Linear economy EPS production cycle Plastic is present everywhere every day either as a raw ma terial or as nished product As a result plastic is a continuous growing industry Indeed its sales has reected a steady growth of about in the period from to Mativenga et al This industry has made rapid progress since plastic is an element used in different sectors In addition to being the main raw mate rial it is a product on which many other processes depend It is estimated that between to of necessary plastic is supplied by local industries Magazine only importing highly spe cialized plastic products or in large volumes Nevertheless most residues end up in landlls culminating a linear economy and af fecting the environment Fig shows the current linear economy to manufacture EPS products in the country Next each of the steps presented in the scheme of EPS lineal economy cycle will be ex plained in detail Raw material According to ASEPLAS the import of plastic resins reached thousand tons in Magazine Plastic companies acquire almost all its raw material from abroad because there is no local petrochemical industry that can produce in large volumes to meet the demand of national industries Futrthermore plastic companies in Ecuador make noeffort s to obt ain raw materials from recycling of EPS waste and don t attempt to nd alternative materials given that EPS is very ingrained in the culture of society EPS product manufacture and Scrap reusereprocess In an attempt to reduce the use of virgin resin residues from the manufacturing process are collected scrap for reuse For this purpose the raw material in the form of a mix of virgin and scrap resin pellets enters the manufacture process to obtain ex panded polystyrene products such as dishes plates drink con tainers Also residues from this process are collected in the form of scrap for later treatment and reuse The latter tries to avoid residues within the boundaries of the company J HidalgoCrespo FX Jervis and CM Moreira et al Procedia CIRP Fig Proposed circular economy cycle Distribution The EPS products are transported to intermediary businesses such as fast food companies grocery stores restaurants resellers and many others that will deliver the products to the nal users Final use The nal user for this cycle is the household owner that ac quires these products and then throws it away as waste usually without sorting it rst as written in the previous section Landll According to the Ministry of Environment MAE nowadays of the municipalities dispose of their waste in landlls and emerg ing cells The rest still dispose the nal waste in openair dumps which generates direct effects on the soil landscape air health and water EPS waste takes as much as years to degrade with out oxygen but the expiration time of landlls is not as long Proposed circular economy EPS production cycle In a circular economy resources are kept in use for as long as possible extracting the maximum value from them whilst in use then recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life Cabello The circular economy concept provides a key opportunity to address the challenge of re source scarcity for both policy makers and industries Companies are urged to play their part and integrate circular economy in their business Stewart et al Biganzoli et al Nowadays singleuse expanded polystyrene manufacturing companies in Ecuador don t recycle postconsumption plastic for their production process In fact they reprocess the scrap mate rial left from the molding and cutting of the plastic products and other forms to process postindustrial resin applying the reuse of the R s of circular economy inside the boundaries of the company After the postindustrial and virgin resin are mixed to create new EPS products However this doesn t mean that less EPS waste is being buried in local landlls As shown in the previous section almost of all waste is buried and between to is recycled Fig shows the proposed circular economy model for EPS waste in dashed red lines The landll is removed in this model by at tempting to reprocess the postconsume waste Individual collection In the current way to recycle waste household owners leave their waste bags outside their homes in the set garbage truck schedule Afterwards individual collectors check the waste and separate all that they think has value In order to recycle EPS waste rst household owners must be conscientized on the sep aration of their residues inside their homes Secondly monetary value must be given to EPS residues by waste recycle companies andor resellers to make individual col lectors also take that type of waste EPS waste resellers The waste is after taken for storage and reselling Such busi nesses already exist and operate in the city so EPS waste must be added to their structure Waste reprocesses The collected EPS must be retransformed in resin pellets to be used in the manufacture of new products This process may be done by the plastic manufacturer or by a third party if it is eco nomically attractive Further information of this process can be seen in Section Results In order to achieve this proposed circular economy scenario problems and constraints must be alleviated rst One of them is precise data on the possibility of obtaining high quality EPS products using recycled postconsume products combined with the used scrap and virgin resin for the manufacturing process In this context from June to August the authors collaborated J HidalgoCrespo FX Jervis and CM Moreira et al Procedia CIRP Fig PostConsume EPS resin transformation process with a local plastic manufacturer in order to formalize the recy cling of singleuse expanded polystyrene postconsume containers The goal was to obtain at least kg of the postconsume recy cled EPS For this purpose one hundred volunteer students from two lo cal universities participated in the collection process and a total amount of kg was collected After collection the manufacturer continued with the protocol agreed for the postconsume recycling process at their quarters The experiment formalization includes all the process starting from the arrival of postconsume EPS waste where the authors helped with the collection through the produc tion of recycled resin and subsequent elaboration of new EPS con tainers Manufacturing of waste recycle resin pellets Fig shows the recycling process of the postconsume plas tic waste until it becomes resin pellets done by the manufactur ing company The rst steps were done in an artisanal manner by just one operator It started with the prewashing of all waste using a hose with pressurized water to remove any remains of or ganic matter impregnated to the waste Continued with the se lectionsegregation of the waste where the operator proceeded to divide the waste between the colors of presentation and excluding any material that could not continue the process After came the washing in a washingmachine where liquid detergent degreaser and liquid chlorine were added and after drying at medium temperature This process lasted around min min washing min drying per cycle and even though the maximum capacity of the washingmachine and dryer is kg only g approximately could be introduced inside the machines during each batch because of the high volume low density of the waste The washing and drying of enough material took ap proximately weeks to obtain almost kg of dry waste After it Fig Manufacturing of postconsume extruded sheet was transported to the reprocess area where the company trans forms the scrap into resin as previously stated There the waste followed three more steps grinding extrusion and pelletiz ing where waste was crushed into small fragments and granules in the grinder then passed to the extruder through heat and pressure until it dissolved and nally ew out of a small outlet and solid ied into a continuous thin line The extruded plastic stream was then cut into pellets by a pellet cutter with a rotation knife and cooled in a water bath at room temperature Manufacturing of postconsume new EPS containers Before the test the company used of virgin resin and of scrap reprocessedreused resin for their process Depending on the type of container built they programmed the sheet extrusion machine for certain thickness of the sheet For the experiment the manufacturer decided to combine all three types of resin before entering the EPS sheet extrusion line using the following mix as shown in Fig Virgin Resin kg Scrap Reprocess ResinReuse kg Recycled PostConsume Resin kg The machine was already in operation with a previous batch when they entered the mix and set to produce mm plates So the rst two rolls see Fig were marked as transition since they contained the previous and new mix and the following two were marked as postconsume Total weight of transition rolls were kg and the weight of the postconsume rolls were kg giving a nal weight of kg The transition roll occurred when shifting from the usual mix to the new proposed mix therefore there were kg of ex tra EPS sheet After this the four rolls were separated and storage for further use in a next session given that all thermo forming machines were busy at the time of the experiment as shown in Fig One week after the sheet rolls of expanded polystyrene were made the manufacturer decided to make in x in foam food containers as the trial run of the new process using the recycling resin They set the postconsume rolls in the machine and started running it Some postconsume containers were taken away for laboratory analysis with other previous ones in order to compare properties J HidalgoCrespo FX Jervis and CM Moreira et al Procedia CIRP Table Laboratory report for characteristics of normal transition and postconsume re cycled containers Container description Average weight g Average resistance kgf A Normal B Transition C Postconsume recycled Laboratory analysis tests Based on the previous sections ve samples of each of the three type of nal products were collected for posterior analysis A Regular mix EPS containers B Reformulated mix EPS containers transition roll C Reformulated mix EPS containers postconsume roll All samples were weighed and their resistance measured after hours Average values are shown in Table We consider the A containers as the base sample The presence of recycled materials seems to make the mixture more rigid Barrera Castro in the tran sition sample However the analysis for the transition was made only hours after production in a previous day so that may be the reason for the difference Also microbiological analysis is necessary for these products to ensure quality through the application of procedures to test the presence of microorganisms and compare them to standard ized limits Mirzaei et al This becomes very important in the context of a circular economy since microorganisms present in food industry as a microora may penetrate EPS waste food con tainers The reprocess of new recycled resin pellets could lead to undesirable effects on public health Nonetheless laboratory analysis effectuated by the manufac turer showed no presence of microorganisms in any of the sam ples This can be explained because the extrusion process occurs at a temperature higher than C for the recycled resin manu facture and almost C for the roll production Both processes add almost min of total time and at these temperatures no mi croorganisms can survive Finally containers or other expanded polystyrene elements can release particles that can be absorbed by food The certication of these products is done by the migration test Plastic materials and objects should not yield their components to food products in quantities exceeding mgdm or mgkg limit of Global Mi gration by Ecuadorian Technical Standard NTE INENEN For this experiment migration test results although being a lit tle higher for recycled containers still showed much lower levels than the limits set by the Ecuadorian Technical Standard Table Conclusions and nal remarks Based on the literature and the country s actual recycle scheme a circular economy model scenario has been proposed Unarguably the benets derived from the implementation of circular economy are due to the reduction in the consumption of natural resources However the economic and environmental benets are not self evident and need to be proven by an indepth analysis such as life cycle assessment of the current and proposed scenarios The primary aim of this research was to contribute to the pri vate singleuse plastic industry to redesign their products using recycled materials To attain this purpose it was made clear that EPS waste reprocess to form new resin pellets is possible and that mixing with virgin and reused pellets can create high quality new products There is a great plastic waste problem and it is an issue that must be considered Most postconsume EPS containers are dis carded in landlls and pollute the environment The rates of waste recovery in Ecuador are very low so it is of vital importance for policy making institutions to increase the knowledge of circular economy and help them asses the feasibility of recycling EPS and develop a supportive system that facilitates and encourages recy cling activities among recyclable waste collectors associations Discussion and future research The plastic companies in the country reusereprocess the scrap left from the production lines This prevents the scrap to endup in landlls and damage environment Nevertheless the reprocess means more energy is needed to recover material through post industrial pellets Thus more analysis is needed to evaluate the to tal damage done to the environment between the two choices by life cycle assessment which is a systematic analysis of the envi ronmental impact of products during their entire life cycle pro duction use and disposal phases This rst attempt to demonstrate the mechanical recyclability of EPS single use products in Ecuador proves the potential for the development of a circular economy around this type of waste ma terial However more trials are need to be set in place to diminish the difference in values for weight and resistance In practice un fortunately remelting and forming new postconsume resin often degrades the properties of the recycled items products Thus the amount of virgin resin shall increase to keep the quality of the nal product and some waste will always be created Also in order to develop a circular economy around domes tic waste people need to participate in the process of separa tion Studies indicate that when made available people will use the colored recycle bins Government intervention is important to surveillance and reinforcement of already made policies for managing possible recycling items Also reprocess companies must have the technology to decontaminate the polymers before melting and resell high quality recycled plastic raw material to the manu facturers Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Marco Roche Eng Technical Manager of Plsticos del Litoral SA PLASTLIT for its involvement and compromise in this project This paper
