Furthermore, the findings reveal trade-offs between households' waste sorting preferences and theamount of time they have to spend sorting. We estimate a value of time for this pro-environmental activity of\\nbetween2.8and6.3EURperhour.Overall,thepresentresearchdemonstratesthathouseholdsexpressdifferent\\npreferences towards the practical design of waste sorting systems.

Introduction\\nThe concept of a circular economy has garnered international at-\\ntention over the last decade. For instance, developing a circular\\neconomyhasbecomeafocalpointfortheUnitedNationsandisseenas\\nvital for progress towards achieving several of the UN Sustainable\\nDevelopment Goals (UNIDO, 2017).\\nThe European Union is among the global frontrunners in policy\\ndevelopmentinthefield–e.g.byintroducingtheconceptofthewaste\\nhierarchyinthe2008EUWasteFrameworkDirective(Directive2008/\\n98/EC, 2008) and most recently by approval of new ambitious mea-\\nsures for developing a circular economy by the EU Member States inMay2018.AccordingtotheEU,‘thenewlegislationrepresentsthemost\\nmodern waste legislation in the world’ (European Commission, 2018).\\nAmongtheaimsareambitioustargetsforrecyclingofmunicipalwaste\\n(55% in 2025, 65% in 2035) and new recycling targets for packagingwaste fractions\\n1ranging from 30% (wood) to 85% (paper).\\nAprerequisiteforincreasingthecircularityofresourceflowsinthe\\neconomy is that waste is maintained in separate resource types. It is\\ntherefore important to analyse the implementation, effectiveness and\\ncost of different waste handling and separation mechanisms. Despite\\nthegrowinginterestinthesubject,mostoftheresearcheffortstodate\\nhavetakenatechnicalsystemperspectiveusingtoolssuchaslifecycle\\nanalysis of waste resources in circular economy (e.g. Mik et al., 2016;\\nScheepens et al., 2016; Huysman et al., 2017). In general, studies into\\nconsumers' propensity to take part in the realization of circular\\neconomy are still lacking (Borrello et al., 2017).\\nIn the present research, we investigate the factors shaping the\\npropensity to engage in household sorting. We hypothesise that they\\nwill influence the likelihood of voluntary compliance with the rules of\\nparticular sorting and hence the effectiveness of the system. Based on\\npreviousstudiesweidentifyfivefactorsthatappeartobeimportantfor\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106402\\nReceived 25 February 2019; Received in revised form 14 July 2019; Accepted 16 July 2019⁎Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: dna@envs.au.dk (D.

To better understand the relative strengths of these factors we\\nspecify a model to characterize the attractiveness of different sorting\\nschemes to the household. We adopt a discrete choice experiment\\n(DCE) method to investigate the trade-offs households make between\\nvariouscharacteristicsofdifferentwastesortingschemes.DCEisawell\\nsuited method for eliciting preferences for outcomes which can be de-\\nscribed by a set of attributes. The method has been widely used in\\ndifferentfields,however,tothebestofourknowledge,itsapplications\\nfor quantifying household preferences for waste sorting schemes are\\nstill limited (except a few examples: Karousakis and Birol, 2008;\\nCzajkowski et al., 2014, 2017; Lee et al., 2017).\\nThis paper makes a contribution to the field in a number of ways.\\nFirstly, in previous environmental economic studies investigatinghousehold preferences for waste separation, the waste sorting system\\nhas been largely described by the number of fractions to sort, for ex-\\nample 1 fraction (no sorting required), 2 fractions, 4 fractions, and so\\non (e.g.Czajkowski et al., 2014). In the present paper, we investigate\\nhow households' preferences for waste sorting schemes may differ ac-cording to the specific waste categories. Household waste consists of\\nmany different waste types and the environmental externalities and\\nscope for resource re-utilisation varies significantly across categories.\\nFocusing only on the number of sorting fractions is insufficient for\\nenvironmental economic evaluation of alternative sorting systems. In\\nthispaper,weincludeattributestoexplicitlyindicatethetypesofwasteto sort: Hazardous waste (e.g. chemicals, batteries, paint, nail vanish),\\nplastics,andbio-wastetoreflectthediversityofthewaste.Sortingbio-\\nwaste is a relevant case as bio-waste makes up the large share of the\\ntotal household waste quantity (e.g. Riber et al., 2009). Moreover, the\\nsorting of bio-waste might exert inconvenience to households due tohygiene and unpleasant odours especially during hot summer seasons\\n(e.g.Gilli et al., 2018). The degree of inconvenience can be an im-\\nportant factor reducing households' waste sorting and has been esti-\\nmated in monetary terms – the so-called inconvenience cost – using\\nDCE (Lee et al., 2017). Batteries, other hazardous waste and plastics\\npresent important environmental risk as these are among waste frac-\\ntions with high content of hazardous chemical substances including\\nmercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) (Riber et al., 2009). Fur-\\nthermore, while recycling of plastics is currently increasing, the en-\\nvironmental and economic rationales are being debated (Craighill and\\nPowell, 1996; Gradus et al., 2017).\\nSecondly, in the existing economic literature, time has been sug-\\ngested as a relevant variable in explaining households' waste sorting\\nbehaviour (e.g. Kipperberg, 2007; Huhtala, 2010; Gilli et al., 2018).\\nHowever, the explicit treatment of time in the designs of previousstudieshasbeenlimited(ifnotnon-existent).Thedesignoftheresearch\\nforthepresentpapermakesitpossibletomakeanexplicitassessmentof\\nthe cost of time incurred by households, which can potentially be in-\\ncluded in cost-benefit analyses of alternative household waste sorting\\nsystems. Thirdly, while previous studies are largely more local in the\\ncoverage (e.g. specific neighbourhood, a city), the analysis for the\\npresent paper draws from a Danish nation-wide survey with a large\\nsample size (n =1011). As such, the present study encompasses the\\nvariation in preferences among households representing the nationalsocio-demographic spread and existing variation in household waste\\nrecycling schemes. From the identification of household preferences,\\nwedevelopatypologyofwastesorterswhichreflecttheheterogeneity\\nof household preferences towards home sorting alternatives. This haspotential relevance for the development of more flexible policy inter-\\nventionsforsupportingmoreeffectivehomewasteseparationschemes.\\nTheoverarchinggoalofthepresentresearchisthereforetoquantify\\nthe scope for further decentralized waste sorting by assessing to what\\nextent households are likely to opt for particular waste separation\\nschemes and by investigating to what extent the designs of waste se-\\nparation options shape households' willingness to engage in sorting\\nactivities.\\nThepaperisstructuredasfollows. Section2providesanoverviewof\\npreviousstudiesonhouseholdpreferencesforparticipatingindifferent\\nwaste management programs. Section 3describes the modelling ap-\\nproach and data collection process. Section 4presents the findings of\\nthe research and section 5discusses these in light of existing body of\\nliterature.Section 6provides concluding remarks and policy insights.\\n2. Overview of existing economic literature on household wastesorting behaviour\\nStudies on household preferences for waste handling schemes to\\ndate have been approached using different scenarios. For example,using contingent valuation survey in Finland, Huhtala (2010) in-\\nvestigatedhouseholdpreferencesovertwodifferentwastemanagement\\nsystems:recyclingversusincineration.Accordingtohercalculation,an\\n‘average resident’ would have much higher probability (72%) for\\nchoosingrecyclingoverincineration(28%).Huhtala'sfindingspointto\\nincome as an important determinant of the household preferences\\nwhere high income households tend to express higher willingness to\\npay for incineration than recycling. Huhtala's interpretation of the\\nfinding is that recycling demands more effort and time and that op-\\nportunitycostoftimeishigherforhouseholdswithhigherincomethan\\nthose with lower income. Furthermore, under the assumption that a\\nhouseholdspendsbetween15and45minperweekrecycling,andthat\\nthe use of spare time has a value of half the wage rate, Huhtala esti-\\nmatesthe‘timecost’associatedwithrecyclingtobewithintherangeof\\nFIM 27–82 (4.54–13.8 EUR) per hour, in 1999.\\nAnother example, a study by Lee et al. (2017), used a choice ex-\\nperiment to investigate people's preferences for and the inconvenience\\ncostofwastesortingalternativesinSouthKorea.MorespecificallyLee\\net al. investigated to what extent waste sorting preferences are influ-\\nenced by, among other things, the availability of an automatic sorting\\nsystem inacentralfacility(with focus onfood wasteandrecyclables),\\ntheoptionofaprivatecompanyvisitingandcollectingwastefromeach\\nindividual household, and the hygiene level of the spot where house-\\nholds otherwise have to drop off their waste. Lee et al. found hetero-\\ngeneity in the waste sorting preferences and the associated incon-\\nvenience costs. To illustrate this, even though an automated\\n(centralized)sortingsystemwouldrequirelesseffort,somepeoplestill\\nprefer to do the sorting themselves (manual). Moreover, the study\\nshowsthatyoungerpeopleexpresshigherinconveniencecostcompared\\nwith the older people.\\nKipperberg and Larson (2012) employed a contingent rating ex-\\nperiment, and evaluated household preferences over five community\\nrecycling programs reflecting anticipated policy changes in the com-\\nmunity recycling system in Seattle. Variation in the five programs was\\ncharacterized by differences in the expected overall recycling rate and\\nthe estimated cost that each household has to bear per month. They\\nreported variations in individual preferences and over the recycling\\nprograms. Their analysis also showed socioeconomic and attitude fac-\\ntors as determinants of the heterogeneity in respondents' preferences\\nacross different community recycling programs. For example, their\\nfindings showed that introducing a food waste recycling program was\\nnot particularly appealing to older respondents and male respondents\\nwhile a positive preference was observed for respondents with higher\\neducationallevel.Whilethefindingsof Huhtala(2010) clearlyshowed\\nincome as an important explanatory factor for household waste re-cycling preferences, the findings of Kipperberg and Larson (2012)D. Nainggolan, et al. Ecological Economics 166 (2019) 106402\\n2 suggestthattherelationbetweenincomeandhouseholdpreferencesfor\\nrecyclingactivitiesisnotthatstraightforward.KipperbergandLarson's\\nstudy found household income only marginally significant for one\\nspecificprogramnamelytheprohibitionofmixingrecyclableitemsinto\\ngeneral waste. A study from the UK showed statistically insignificant\\nrelationship between recycling rate and income (Abbott et al., 2011).\\nSomeotherstudiesinvestigatedtowhatextenthouseholdspreferto\\nsort waste at home as opposed to the alternative of leaving the waste\\nsorting to be professionally handled by another party for example at a\\ncentralfacility.Differencesinthefindingsfromthesestudiesareworth\\nnoting.Forexample,inastudyby BartelingsandSterner,1999,57%of\\nthe respondents would consider the possibility of not having to do thesorting themselves, however, only 40% of this group (i.e. 23% of the\\ntotal respondents) expressed positive willingness to pay for such a\\nservice. The study reported an average WTP of 420 SEK (47.7 EUR), a\\nfigure which is about five times lower than the estimated value of\\nsorting effort of 2500 SEK (283.9 EUR) which is based on the average\\nnumberofhoursspentonsortingandtheaverageincomeperhourafter\\ntax.Anotherexample,inastudyfromNorwayby Bruvolletal.(2000),\\n72% of the respondents would rather have the sorting conducted by a\\nrecyclingcompany,albeitunderthepremisethattheprovisionofsuch\\na service does not lead to additional expenses on the respondents. On\\nthe contrary, choice experiment based studies by Czajkowski et al.\\n(2014, and again in 2017) reported that on average their respondents\\nprefer to sort waste at home even if doing so incurs cost (including\\nefforts and time) to the respondents. To illustrate, 70% of their re-\\nspondents display a positive preference for sorting their household\\nwaste into five categories compared to not doing any sorting.\\nPreviousresearchhasshownthathouseholdchoicestotakepartin\\nmore demanding waste handling schemes, such as recycling, can be\\nexplained by a multitude of factors. Household participation is influ-\\nencedbythesocalled“inconveniencefactor”becausehouseholdshave\\nto make effort, to allocate space, and to give up time to undertake re-cycling activities (Huhtala, 2010; Sidique et al., 2010a; Czajkowski\\net al., 2017). These activities also incur extra household expenses e.g.\\ndue to the use of warm water for cleaning some of the materials (e.g.\\nBruvoll et al., 2000). The provision of waste collection set up and re-\\ncyclinginfrastructure,whichcontributestolesseningtheinconvenience\\nfactor, has also been shown as an important determinant (Gilli et al.,\\n2018). To illustrate, travel distance to a drop-off recycling site has\\nnegative effects on the rate of visits to the site (Sidique et al., 2010a).\\nStudiesshowthathouseholdsdisplaygreaterrecyclingactivitiesunder\\nthecurbsidecollectionsystemthanifthehouseholdsthemselveshave\\nto transport the recyclable materials to a collection station (e.g. Hong\\net al., 1993; Caplan et al., 2002; Karousakis and Birol, 2008; Sidique\\net al., 2010b; Gilli et al., 2018). Existing studies also show that more\\nfrequent collection systems tend to be preferred by households (e.g.Karousakis and Birol, 2008; Czajkowski et al., 2017). Furthermore,\\npeople express different preferences towards recycling programs de-\\npendingontheexpectedrecyclingrateandhowmuchitwouldcostthe\\nhouseholds to participate in the programs (Kipperberg and Larson,\\n2012). Some studies indicate that higher fees for waste disposals and\\nthe implementation of variable pricing of waste disposal would give\\npeopleincentivetorecyclemore(e.g. Hongetal.,1993; Sidiqueetal.,\\n2010b).However,arecentstudyfromNorway(HellerandVatn,2017)suggeststhattheintroductionofeconomicincentives,throughaweight\\nbased fee on waste, trigger different responses. For some households,\\nthe scheme encourages them to sort more due to cost saving. In other\\nwords, these households respond positively to the external push\\nbroughtaboutbytheeconomicincentive.Meanwhile,theintroduction\\nof economic incentive does not change the degree of sorting done by\\nthose households who are self-motivated; that they do not end up\\nsorting more after the introduction of the scheme. Heller and Vatn\\n(2017)argue that this illustrates that people motivated by environ-\\nmental concerns may question the justification of an economic in-\\ncentivescheme,andasaresulttheschemecanbecounterproductive.Arecent study from Italy by Gilli et al. (2018) shows that the efficacyof\\npolicies to promote recycling is very much dependent on individual\\nmotivations.\\nAnother line of research has uncovered the important role of per-\\nsonal belief, moral aspects, social norms and social interactions. A re-\\ncent study by Czajkowski et al. (2017), based on a survey in a neigh-\\nbourhood in Poland, revealed that the majority of the household\\nrespondentsprefertosortthemselvesprimarilybecausetheybelieveit\\nwouldnotbedoneasthoroughlyatacentralfacility.Thishighlightsthe\\nimportanceoftrustinthesystem,andithasbeenevidencedthatreports\\naboutsortedwasteendingupinincinerationfacilitieshavereducedthe\\nmotivation to sort (e.g. Ingeniøren, 2012; Bolius, 2016). Some studies\\nhave shown that the propensity to participate in recycling schemes iscloselyrelatedtothedegreetowhichindividualsperceiverecyclingas\\ntheir moral obligation, that they are doing the right thing for the en-\\nvironment, and that they hold a sense of personal responsibility for\\nsorting (e.g. Bruvoll et al., 2000; Berglund, 2006; Nyborg et al., 2006;\\nBrekkeetal.,2010; HellerandVatn,2017).Forsomeindividuals,doing\\nso is part of maintaining their self-image (Nyborg et al., 2006; Brekke\\net al., 2010; Czajkowski et al., 2017). Previous research reveals that\\nindividuals' recycling behaviour is also influenced by views and beha-\\nviours with regard to recycling of those within the individuals' com-\\nmunity or social network. Individuals are more likely to recycle when\\ntheirfamilyandfriendsalsosharetheideathatrecyclingisanactivity\\nworth pursuing. In the same vein, individuals are more likely to put\\ngreatereffortsintorecyclingwhentheythinkthattheirneighboursand\\nothersintheircommunityarealsodoingtheirshare.Theroleofsocial\\ninfluence is particularly important to individuals when they are not\\ncertain about their personal recycling responsibility (Brekke et al.,\\n2010). Finally, previous studies have reported a number of socio-eco-\\nnomicdeterminantsofhouseholdwastehandlingbehavioursincluding\\nage, income, household size, and employment (e.g. Hong et al., 1993;\\nHuhtala, 2010; Sidique et al., 2010a, 2010b; Kipperberg and Larson,\\n2012;Lee et al., 2017).\\n3. Methods and data\\n3.1. Model specification\\nWe use a choice modelling approach to quantify the importance of\\ndifferent factors in household's preferences for different waste sorting\\nschemes. This follows the same approach as other economic studies\\nanalysing household's waste sorting and recycling preferences\\n(Kipperberg, 2007; Huhtala, 2010; Czajkowski et al., 2014; Lee et al.,\\n2017). The approach follows the standard random utility framework,\\nwheretheutilitythatrespondent ngainsfromwastesortingalternative\\njis specified as (Adamowicz et al., 1998):\\n= +V U . nj nj nj\\n(1)\\nAssuch,thefirstcomponent, Vnj,isthedeterministiccomponentof\\nindividual n's utility, captured through the attributes of the waste\\nsortingandhandlingalternative j.Basedontheliterature,wedefine Vnj\\nas a linear function of seven waste sorting attributes. The first three\\nattributesconcernthetypeofwastetobeseparated,astherespondents\\nmay attach different level of importance to recycling waste with dif-\\nferent environmental impact profiles. Furthermore, different types of\\nwaste may also involve different levels of nuisance to the households.\\nThe three types of waste are hazardous waste, plastics and bio-waste.\\nThe fourth attribute reflects the effectiveness ofthe system in terms of\\nreuse of the material, i.e. percentage of the material that will re-entertheeconomicsystemasnewproducts.Thefifthattributemeasuresthe\\neffort (time) required by the household to sort, and the sixth and se-\\nventhattributescapturethelevelofserviceandcostrespectively.These\\nfactors are measured as the frequency of waste collection and the an-\\nnual fee for waste collection and handling (Table 1).\\nThe second component, ε\\nnj, is a random component of the utilityD.

These factors are captured by asking\\nrespondents to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree to\\neach of six statements: three statements related to internal motivation\\nand the other three for capturing social influence (see the last six\\nvariables in Table 2). To quantify potential heterogeneity in re-\\nspondents' preferences for waste sorting and handling alternatives, we\\nestimate a Latent Class Model (LCM) (Boxall and Adamowicz, 2002;\\nGreene and Hensher, 2003; Train, 2003). Following the LCM frame-\\nwork,thelatentheterogeneityofhouseholdwastesortingpreferencesiscaptured by assigning households into S number of segments. LCM\\ntherefore identifies individual segments (s=1,…,S) and the utility\\nfunction for respondents in each segment can now be expressed as:\\n= + X U . nj s snj nj s\\n(3)\\nFollowing this, the probability ofchoosing waste sorting jamongJ\\nalternatives for respondent nbelonging to segment s(Pns∣(j)) can be\\ncalculated (Greene and Hensher, 2003):\\n=e\\nePns jX\\nk JX( )sj\\nsk\\n(4)\\nEachrespondent nhasaprobabilitytobelongtoanysegmenteven\\nthough the association of respondents to segments is not known.

We use a Latent Class framework following the argument\\npreviouslymadebyothers(see BoxallandAdamowicz,2002; Beharry-\\nBorgetal.,2013),thattheLCMoffersrelevantandpracticalinsightsforpolicy developments on the heterogeneity of the target population.\\nContinuous specification of the distribution of preferences, using a\\nmixed logit specification, often reveals less insight for policy making.\\nWe use Nlogit version 5 to estimate the models (Greene, 1986–2012).\\n3.2. Calculation of willingness to pay for different levels of recycling and\\ninconvenience cost\\nWe calculate the household average willingness to pay for changes\\nin scheme requirements for sorting of waste and other scheme attri-butes.

The\\nfindings from Czajkowski et al. (2017) also indicate that their re-\\nspondents gain utility from more frequent waste collection. In the\\npresent study, based on the LCM, the frequency of waste collection\\nattribute is only statistically significant for one of the four segments.\\nFurthermore, contrary to findings reported from previous studies, the\\npresent research indicates that one segment of the respondents in our\\nstudyactuallypreferslessfrequentwastecollection.Nonetheless,inour\\nchoiceexperiment,whiletheattributeforwastecollectionfrequencyis\\nalso categorical with three levels, the level specification is slightly\\ndifferent from that of Czajkowski et al.

To illustrate, the average willingness to pay\\nestimatefortheoptiontosortplasticfor‘thesortingenthusiastic’(S3)is\\n6timesashighasfor‘thefrequentwastecollectionresisters’(S1).This\\nsuggests that, compared with ‘the frequent waste collection resisters’\\n(S1), ‘the sorting enthusiastic’ (S3) has much higher preference for a\\nwaste sorting scenario with plastic separation.\\nThe four segments can be further distinguished based on a number\\nof factors. Households in segment 1 (‘the frequent waste collection\\nresisters’ (S1)) prefer the existing arrangement for dropping off ha-\\nzardouswasteatadesignatedwastefacilityawayfromtheirresidential\\nareas. In addition, households in this segment appear to be very sen-\\nsitivetohowoftenwastecollectiontakesplace.Householdsinsegment\\n2 (‘the sceptics’ (S2)) appear to be indifferent towards the option for\\nlocal collection point for hazardous waste. Households in segment 3\\n(‘the sorting enthusiastic’ (S3)) – which have a majority of women -\\nhave positive preferences towards the possibility for disposing ha-\\nzardous waste within close proximity to where they live and towards\\nthe requirement to sort plastic as well as bio-waste. Households in\\nsegment 4 (‘the bio-waste sorting resisters’ (S4)) are not very keen on\\nthe idea of having a local collection point for hazardous waste. They\\nalso demonstrate a negative preference towards bio-waste sorting.\\nUsing a probit model we have identified a range of household socio-\\ndemographiccharacteristicsincludinggender,typeofaccommodation,\\nand occupation as determinants of the heterogeneity of households'\\nwaste sorting preferences. To illustrate, female respondents, living in\\napartments and who are not currently studying are more likely tobelongto‘thesortingenthusiastic’(S3).Additionally,ourfindingsshow\\nthatrespondents'currenthabitsonsortinganduseofrecyclingfacilities\\nappeartobeimportantpredictorsofwastesortingpreferencesforsome\\nsegments. To illustrate, in our research, a higher frequency of use of a\\nrecycling centre is closely related to the likelihood of belonging to the\\n‘frequent waste collection resisters’ (S1), while the opposite relation is\\nevident for the ‘the sorting enthusiastic’ (S3).\\nPreviousstudieshavediscussedthesignificanceofpersonalintrinsic\\nmotivation as well as social pressures in explaining household beha-\\nviours with regards to waste sorting and handling (Czajkowski et al.,\\n2017;Leeetal.,2017; HellerandVatn,2017).Inthepresentresearch,\\nthe aforementioned attitudinal factors were found statistically sig-nificant in explaining household preferences for alternative waste\\nsorting schemes. For ‘the frequent waste collection resisters’ (S1), in\\ngeneral the preference towards waste sorting by households in this\\nsegment has positive association with their internal motivation i.e.\\nbeing self-conscious about the need for waste sorting. The opposite\\ntrend of association between personal motivation and waste sorting\\nbehavioursisevidentfortwosegments-‘thesceptics’(S2)and‘thebio-\\nwaste sorting resisters’ (S4). Furthermore, our findings also show that\\nthe role ofsocial pressures is only statistically significant and negative\\nin explaining the preference of only one segment - ‘the sceptics’ (S2).\\nFor the ‘sorting enthusiastic’ (S3), their waste sorting behaviour does\\nnot appear to be dictated by external motivation; as indicated by the\\nstatistically significant and negative relation between belonging to\\nsegment 3 and agreement with the importance of collective effort to\\nhandle waste sorting with neighbours.\\nIn the present research, we are able to derive the implied value of\\ntime that reflects variation in household preferences for home sorting.\\nWe estimate the implied value of time for each of the four segments\\nbasedonthecorrespondingparameterestimatesfortimeattributeand\\nannualbill forwastecollectionattribute. Wefoundthat‘the bio-waste\\nsorting resisters’ (S4) has the highest implied value of time of 46.69DKK(6.28EUR)perhourwhile‘thefrequentwastecollectionresisters’\\n(S1)hasthelowestimpliedvalueoftimeof20.72DKK(2.78EUR)per\\nhour. Meanwhile the implied values of time for ‘the sceptics’ (S2) and\\n‘thesortingenthusiastic’(S3)are35.15DKK(4.72EUR)and31.32DKK\\n(4.21EUR)respectively.Itisnoteworthythateventhehighestimplied\\nvalue of time of 47 DKK (6.3 EUR) per hour is still lower than the\\nminimumwageforDenmarkofapproximately110DKK(14.8EUR)per\\nhour. The results indicate that sorting waste at homes still incurs op-\\nportunitycostoftimetohouseholds.Atthesametime,thefindingalso\\nsuggeststhatthevalueoftimeforpro-environmentalactivitiessuchas\\nhome waste sorting is not necessarily comparable to wage earning ac-\\ntivities. Our finding is somewhat consistent with other studies albeit\\nusing a different approach. Bruvoll and Nyborg (2002), Bartelings and\\nSterner , 1999, Berglund (2006) reported respondents' willingness to\\npay for having others to sort waste being substantially lower than the\\naverage wage rate. Huhtala (2010) estimated the ‘time cost’ for re-\\ncycling efforts by assuming the value ofspare time at half ofthe wagerate. Literature from other fields, such as transportation studies, also\\npointsoutthatthevalueofleisuretimeisdifferentfromthewagerate\\n(e.g.Jara-Díazetal.,2008).Directlycomparingtheopportunitycostof\\ntime for household waste sorting derived from this study with those\\nreported by earlier studies is rather problematic. This is partly due to\\nthe fact that the other studies were undertaken using different metho-\\ndologicalapproachesandadopteddifferentassumptionswithregardto\\nthe appropriate value of time for waste sorting or recycling activities.\\nOur research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to ex-\\nplicitly capture the opportunity cost of time associated with waste se-\\nparation at household level.\\nAll in all, the present research shows that, although in general\\nDanishhouseholdsaresupportiveofahomewasteseparationprogram,\\ntheirpreferencesforparticipationareheterogeneousandareinfluenced\\nbyawiderangeoffactors.Forexample,somehouseholdsarenotkeen\\non sorting bio-waste and are very critical about how much effort theyD.

Meanwhile, other\\nhouseholds are enthusiastic to sort different categories of waste in-\\ncluding bio-waste, however they are the only segment infavour ofthe\\nproposed provision of local collection points for hazardous waste. As\\nsuch, for households belonging to this segment – ‘the sorting en-\\nthusiastic’ (S3), the existing system requiring households to drop off\\ncertain categories of waste (such as hazardous waste) to a designated\\nfacility,whichistypicallylocatedawayfromresidentialareas,seemsto\\nbe sub optimal. Furthermore, being convinced that their efforts for\\nsorting is worthwhile (as indicated by the proportion of waste getting\\nrecirculatedtotheeconomy)isimportant,theeffectsappeartobemore\\npronounced on some groups (‘the sceptics’ (S2) and ‘the bio-waste\\nsorting resisters’ (S4)).\\nItisimportanttoacknowledgeacaveatthatfinanciallylessaffluent\\nand less educated households are slightly underrepresented in our\\nsamplesurvey.Thesehouseholdsmaydisplaywastesortingpreferences\\nthat are different from those households with higher education and\\nincome level.

Secondly, by having time and waste collection fee at-\\ntributes in the choice set ups, we are able to approximate the implied\\nvalue of time respondents ascribe on home sorting. Our findings in-\\ndicate that the values range between 21 and 47 DKK (2.8 to 6.3 EUR)\\nperhour,whichisonlyafractionoftheminimumwageforDenmarkof\\napproximately DKK 110 (14.8 EUR). This shows that home sorting ac-\\ntually incurs opportunity cost of time to households. However, the\\nvalue of time for pro-environmental activities such as home waste\\nsorting cannot be directly estimated from wage earning activities.\\nThirdly,withtherelativelylargesizeofthesampleinourstudy(1011\\nhouseholds) we were able to model the heterogeneity of preferences\\namongtherespondentswithregardtodifferentoptionsofhomewaste\\nsorting.

The heterogeneity in their\\npreferences is particularly related to how households in each of these\\nfour segments respond to the following factors: the option to have a\\nlocalcollectionpointforhazardouswaste,therequirementtosortbio-\\nwaste, and the frequency of waste collection. We also found that the\\nsegmentation of the households hence the heterogeneity in household\\npreferences forhome waste sortingis to a certain extent related tothe\\nsociodemographic characteristics of the respondents including gender,\\noccupation, and the type of housing where respondents reside.\\nMoreover, respondents' current level of waste sorting effort as well as\\npersonal motivation and social influence were found to be important\\npredictorsofsomesegments.Overallfindingsfromthepresentresearchsuggest that household preferences for home waste sorting and hand-\\nling are not homogeneous.

At city level, conventional statistics on waste are oftenincomplete or lack detail. Waste input-output accounting offers an alternative, using waste supply and\\nuse tables to create detailed inventories of economy-wide ﬂows of waste. In this study we develop such\\ntables for the city-region of Brussels (Belgium) and use them to analyse the urban waste metabolism interms of waste ﬂows, waste production intensity and waste treatment performance.\\nThe waste ﬂow analysis revealed: the amount of collected waste; the proportion contributed by indi-\\nvidual sectors; the material composition of waste ﬂows and the location of treatment. Currently, around\\n50% of the 1.5 million tons of waste collected in Brussels is treated in local facilities. However, less than1% of the collected waste is used in a way that closes material cycles within city limits. The waste per-\\nformance analysis reveals that the construction sector had the highest waste production intensity and\\nthe household sector the highest incineration intensity. In terms of waste prevention and local valorisa-tion potential, we identiﬁed ﬂows and sectors for future targeting, one of the most promising being food\\nwaste. We conclude that the urban context can restrict the local valorisation of waste ﬂows, thus we see\\nthe role of cities such as Brussels in a circular economy as mainly contributing to the closing of materialcycles at national or even global level.\\n/C2112018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\\n1. Introduction\\n1.1. Waste ﬂows and the circular economy\\nThe global amounts of waste generated are estimated between 7\\nand 10 billion tons per year ( Wilson et al., 2015 ). The amount of\\nsolid waste recorded in ofﬁcial statistics is around 3.2 billion tons.\\nIt is estimated that from this amount 47% is landﬁlled, 31% recycled\\nand 22% incinerated ( Tisserant et al., 2017 ). Thus, almost 70% of\\nwaste is currently not reused or recycled. This represents an\\nenormous loss of resources and explains the high pressure on global\\nprimary resources. However, not only the depletion of resources\\nconstitutes an environmental (as well as socio-economic) chal-\\nlenge, but also the impacts from the treatment of the waste repre-\\nsent negative externalities. First of all, environmental impacts\\nfrom uncontrolled disposal of waste into the environment, for\\nexample accumulation of micro plastics in the oceans threateningthe marine fauna ( Avio et al., 2017 ). But also, environmental\\nimpacts from controlled waste treatment processes create environ-\\nmental problems, for example, methane from landﬁlls that consti-\\ntute around 4% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions\\n(Ackerman, 2000 ) or the emissions of air pollutants from waste\\nincineration ( Lu et al., 2017 ).\\nIn order to reduce environmental pressure from waste, resource\\nand waste management principles have been introduced into\\nwaste legislation. The most important principle implemented in\\nthe European waste legislation is the waste hierarchy establishing\\na priority order from prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling\\nand energy recovery to disposal activities, such as landﬁlling ( EC,\\n2008 ). The waste hierarchy is a generalised, and widely accepted,\\nenvironmental ranking where prevention is considered to be the\\nmost environment-friendly and landﬁll the least environment-\\nfriendly alternative. However, results from life cycle assessments\\n(LCA) have shown that such generalization is problematic and that\\nenvironmental performances show strong dependency on local\\nspeciﬁcities of the waste management systems ( Laurent et al.,\\n2014 ). Also article 4(2) of the Waste Framework Directive\\n(2008/98/EC) allows deviations from the waste hierarchy where\\nthis is justiﬁed by LCA results.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.10.034\\n0956-053X/ /C2112018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.⇑Corresponding authors.\\nE-mail addresses: vzeller@ulb.ac.be (V.

Achten).Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94\\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\\nWaste Management\\njournal homepage: www.else vier.com/loc ate/wasman\\n Currently, the so-called circular economy (CE) concepts are pro-\\nmoted to achieve more waste prevention and better resource man-\\nagement by extending and closing material cycles. CE concepts are\\npromoted at European level through the Circular Economy Pack-\\nage, adopted by the EC in 2015, including legislative proposals\\nand other initiatives ( EC, 2015 ). Important actions are the 2030 tar-\\ngets for recycling (65% for municipal solid waste (MSW), 70% for\\nconstruction and demolition (C&D) waste, 75% for packaging\\nwaste), landﬁll restrictions (MSW reduction to 10%), promotion\\nof industrial symbiosis and eco-design. Even if waste prevention\\nat source has highest priority, quantitative waste prevention tar-\\ngets (except for food waste) are still lacking in European\\nlegislation.\\n1.2. Circular economy at city scale\\nDue to the dynamic population and economic development in\\ncities, the environmental pressure in terms of resource consump-\\ntion and waste generation is especially high in cities ( Hoornweg\\net al., 2013 ). To improve local performances, many cities turning\\ntowards CE concepts, for example organised in the circular cities\\nnetwork. A current review of CE initiatives around the globe iden-\\ntiﬁed 83 cities that promote CE, but with different targets and\\ninterests ( Petit-Boix and Leipold, 2018 ).\\nProximity of resources and people, a sufﬁcient scale for effective\\nmarkets (supply1and demand) and the ability to shape urban plan-\\nning and policy are seen as factors for the unique position of cities in\\nCE. The geographic proximity of supply and demand is expected to\\nhave environmental beneﬁts through more efﬁcient material collec-\\ntion cycles and more efﬁcient reverse logistic ( Ellen MacArthur\\nFoundation, 2017 ). This proximity advantage is also frequently men-\\ntioned in the context of urban symbiosis, which is based on the ‘ syn-\\nergistic opportunity arising from the geographic proximity of urban\\nwaste sources and potential industrial users’ through exchange of\\nwaste materials for environmental beneﬁt ( Van Berkel et al., 2009 ).\\nAlthough environmental beneﬁts are mentioned in the context\\nof urban CE, few environmental assessments of urban initiatives\\nare available and complementary CE-related environmental\\nresearch is rarely applied at city level ( Petit-Boix and Leipold,\\n2018 ). However, some environmental assessments of CE develop-\\nments at city level are available for Asian cities. For example,\\nFang et al. (2017) found resources and carbon footprint savings\\nin one of China’s national pilot cities for CE. Sun et al. (2017) found\\nlife cycle environmental beneﬁts of urban symbiosis within a typ-\\nical industrial city in China and Geng et al. (2010) found CO 2reduc-\\ntions for urban symbiosis scenarios in Kawasaki (Japan).\\nComparative environmental assessments of CE activities\\nbetween the city and larger scales are less frequent. Wang et al.\\n(2018) evaluated the performance of 40 cities in China based on\\nan index system for CE developments (considering mainly environ-\\nmental criteria) and found higher growth of CE in the pilot cities\\nthan in the rest of the country. Other comparative analyses are car-\\nried out for speciﬁc CE initiatives within cities, for example, for\\nurban agriculture. Comparisons of urban and conventional agricul-\\ntural systems have shown environmental beneﬁts for certain types\\nof urban agricultural systems ( Goldstein et al., 2016 ). However,\\nthese studies did not systematically investigate the use of urban\\nbiowaste. The case studies investigated by Sanyé-Mengual et al.\\n(2013, 2015 ) found a reduction of embodied greenhouse gases\\nfrom reduced transport, packaging, and food distribution losses.However, the question about the impact of the geographical\\nscale is not only an environmental one. It is also highly relevant\\nfor techno-economic feasibility of CE initiatives. Sterr and Ott\\n(2004) state that ‘ the ‘‘right size ”is the minimal size in which outputs\\ncan be retransformed into desired inputs, thereby adequately closing\\nmaterial loops ’. In their case study in an industrial region, any kind\\nof material could be recycled within the regional boundaries,\\nexcept of metals. However, the size of the market needs to be suf-\\nﬁciently large (critical mass) to sustain specialized industries and\\nto provide economically viable CE solutions.\\nChen et al. (2012) found that the size of ‘recycling boundaries’\\ndepends on the type of waste. For example, waste oil, metal, plas-\\ntics, paper, and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE),\\nare circulated in large regions (large recycling boundaries),\\nwhereas organic wastes, mixed MSW, and demolition wastes, aresuitable for local recycling and recovery. According to the analysis\\nofChen et al. (2014) , the determinants of recycling boundaries are\\nthe density of separated waste and the unit transportation/treat-\\nment cost. Waste with high market value, accumulated at low den-\\nsity and low unit cost of transportation/treatment, such as metal\\nand glass, are typically recycled at large scale. Waste with low mar-\\nket value accumulated at high density and high unit cost and trans-\\nportation/treatment (residual MSW, food waste and bulky waste)\\nare more suited for local recycling. However, the appropriate size\\nof scale must be determined based on speciﬁc local conditions.\\n1.3. Waste and CE strategy in Brussels\\nSince 2016 Brussels has a Regional Program for a Circular Econ-\\nomy ( PREC, 2016 ) that includes a set of transversal, sectorial, terri-\\ntorial and governance measures to support the city’s CE transition.\\nThe dematerialisation of the economy, implementation of\\nextended product cycles and the reduction of environmental\\nimpacts are deﬁned as ﬁnal environmental targets of the plan.\\nHowever, the local economic stimulation, i.e. the creation of local\\njobs and local value chains are the central criteria of the program.\\nThe sectorial measures target priority sectors like construction,\\nresource & waste, logistics (transport), commerce and food. For\\nthe resource & waste sector, repair and reuse are identiﬁed as core\\nactions of local CE.\\nThe CE program is closely interlinked with Brussels’ Waste Plan.\\nThe current 4th Waste Plan ( Bruxelles Environnement, 2010 )\\nincludes a waste prevention program, targets for separate collec-\\ntion and targets for the recycling of MSW and C&D waste. It also\\ncontains quantitative waste prevention targets for food, paper,\\npackaging, diapers, garden waste and other waste categories from\\nhouseholds and economic sectors. In 2010, a legal obligation\\nbecame effective to separately collect the recyclable fractions ofhousehold waste. In 2014 the legal obligation was extended to eco-\\nnomic activities. Currently, the 5th Waste Plan is under develop-\\nment which focusses on CE and a zero waste strategy (Region de\\nBruxelles-Capitale, 2018 ).\\nDespite the legal framework and dedicated programs, the mon-\\nitoring report about MSW management in Belgium shows a low\\noverall recycling rate for Brussels ( Gentil, 2013 ). Also more recent\\ndatasets ( Eurostat, 2018a ) show an overall MSW recycling rate of\\naround 27% for Brussels while the average Belgian performance\\nwas 54% in 2013. In Gentil (2013) the low performance is explained\\nby the lack of infrastructure for the treatment of organic waste and\\nlack of collection/recycling infrastructure related to the high urban\\ndensity.\\nThe city’s Waste Plan (\\nBruxelles Environnement, 2010 ) states a\\nnumber of constraints and challenges for the local waste manage-\\nment sector such as the high population density (7,434 persons per\\nkm2(Eurostat, 2018b ), the small territory (only 161 km2) and the\\nhighly urbanized terrain (residential and service sector land use1The sufﬁcient market scale for waste/resources at city level is also discussed in\\nthe context of ‘urban mining’. Urban mining involves the systematic recovery orextraction of materials from urban areas where large stocks of materials are found, inparticular in buildings and infrastructure, end-of-life products, packaging material,and biomass (Li, 2015).V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 84 of 63% ( Eurostat, 2017 )). These conditions limit the availability of\\nsites and the infrastructure network necessary to build new sorting\\nor recycling facilities. The fact that most people live in multi-\\napartment buildings and have no access to a private garden (share\\nof apartments 47% of the 517.000 houses ( Bruxelles\\nEnvironnement, 2010 )) is considered as a constraint for an efﬁcient\\nwaste separation and storage. The city’s economy is characterised\\nby a high share of service and public sector (90% of gross value\\nadded ( Eurostat, 2018c )) and by a small company size. Since most\\ncompanies are integrated in the urban network, it is difﬁcult to\\nmonitor the waste produced by these companies.\\n1.4. Data availability, accounting frameworks and analytical methods\\nIn order to study the development of innovative waste manage-\\nment options and implementation of CE models, detailed informa-\\ntion on current and future waste ﬂows is needed. This requires the\\navailability of (i) detailed waste (statistical) data on the amount of\\nwaste generated, collected and treated, (ii) accounting frameworks\\nto link waste with other relevant ﬂows (production/consumption)\\nin a coherent manner and (iii) analytical tools to assess\\nperformances.\\nRegarding data availability, Hage and Söderholm (2008) state\\nthat waste management analyses should rely on local data, but\\nthat data availability at city-region level is often problematic. Also\\nPrendeville et al. (2017) identiﬁed a lack of access to data as a key\\nbarrier to the implementation of initiatives in cities. More speciﬁ-\\ncally, the availability of waste (statistical) data at the local and\\nregional scale is challenging in terms of data coverage (households\\nand economic activities), detail (waste composition), spatial/sector\\nresolution and temporal completeness (availability of time series).\\nRegarding the availability of accounting frameworks that link\\nwaste with production and consumption data, methodological pro-\\ngress has been achieved in the last years and an international stan-\\ndard, the system of environmental economic accounts ( SEEA, 2014 )\\nhas been developed. Economy-wide material ﬂow accountings\\n(EW-MFA) which are published by most European countries since\\n2014, are part of this framework. These datasets have improved the\\ndata availability on physical material ﬂows, but data is highly\\naggregated and reported at country scale only. For Brussels, a\\nmetabolism study is available that has used the EW-MFA frame-\\nwork ( Athanassiadis et al., 2016 ). The solid material inputs, addi-\\ntion to the net stock, and the output ﬂows (exports) were\\nquantiﬁed and complemented by an energy and water balance\\n(reference year 2011).\\nMore detailed datasets in terms of sector resolution are\\ninput-output (IO) frameworks, which are also part of the SEEA. In\\nconventional IO frameworks, product and service ﬂows betweeneconomic sectors and towards the ﬁnal demand sectors are mea-\\nsured in monetary terms. Waste treatment services are accounted,\\nbut ﬂows of waste (without positive monetary value) are not avail-\\nable. In order to account for waste ﬂows and to assess impacts of\\nwaste treatment processes Nakamura and Kondo (2002) developed\\nthe waste input-output model (WIO model). It is a conceptual\\nframework to include physical waste ﬂows into the monetary\\nIO-framework. The WIO model was further developed into several\\ndirections: (i) towards a model where also the product ﬂows are\\naccounted in physical units ( Nakamura et al., 2007 ), (ii) towards\\na model where waste ﬂows are integrated into a monetary supply\\nand use model ( Lenzen and Reynolds, 2014 ) and towards an\\nmultiregional monetary supply and use model ( Fry et al., 2016 ).\\nAlthough the theoretical foundation of WIO models and the\\ndevelopment towards material ﬂows accountings have been intro-\\nduced since more than 15 years, to date only few databases are\\navailable that provide complementary physical and monetary data.\\nAn exception is the EXIOBASE database, a global multi-regionalenvironmentally extended IO database, available in a monetary\\nand physical (hybrid) version ( Tukker et al., 2013; Wood et al.,\\n2014 ). At the sub-national level, for example the city-level, such\\ndetailed IO-datasets, but even the aggregated EW-MFA are hardly\\navailable.\\nTo analyse product and waste ﬂows at the scale of an economy,\\nmaterial ﬂow analysis (MFA) and input–output analysis (IOA) are\\nused as analytical methods.\\nMaterial Flow Analysis is ‘‘ a systematic assessment of the ﬂows\\nand stocks of materials within a system deﬁned in space and time ”’\\n(Brunner and Rechberger, 2004 ). The basic principle of MFA is\\nthe mass balance stating that the inputs into a system must equal\\nthe outputs (i.e. law of conservation of matter/energy). Regarding\\nits original area of application, Brunner and Rechberger (2004)\\nspecify (i) the metabolism of cities and (ii) the analysis of pollutantpathways. Guibrunet et al. (2016) deﬁne urban metabolism as\\n‘‘framework that takes material ﬂows as the unit of analysis to\\ndescribe patterns of natural resources transformation in cities ”. The\\nurban metabolism gives a holistic view on all activities in a city\\nincluding all inputs, stocks, and outputs of materials and energy.\\nWhile the standard urban metabolism study represents an analysis\\nof the status quo at a certain time point, recently the framework of\\ndynamic urban metabolism has been developed ( Athanassiadis\\net al., 2017 ).\\nThe urban metabolism aims to give a general picture of ﬂows,\\none of the output ﬂows being waste ﬂows. The waste metabolism\\nis a type of analysis that studies speciﬁcally the ﬂows of waste\\nfrom generation to treatment. D’Alisa et al. (2012) suggest the\\nuse of new indicators to describe the waste metabolism: the meta-\\nbolic rate of waste and the density of waste. The waste metabolic\\nrate indicates the pace of waste generated or disposed per hour\\nof human activity. The density of waste indicates the amount of\\nwaste generated, separately collected or disposed per day in a\\ngiven area. Browne et al. (2009) suggest to use the materials meta-\\nbolic inefﬁciency indicator which relates the ﬁnal disposal of mate-\\nrial and product wastes to consumption in order to determine\\nsectoral inefﬁciency. The use of new waste performance indicators\\nand the graphical representation of waste ﬂows as metabolic net-\\nwork composed of ﬂows and functional nodes (treatment facilities)\\nare the main characteristics of the waste metabolic analysis con-\\nducted by Chifari et al. (2016) .\\n(Environmentally extended) input-output analysis (EE-IOA) is\\nan analytical method to calculate direct and indirect economic\\nand environmental impacts induced by ﬁnal consumption. When\\ninput–output analyses (IOA) are applied to waste input-output\\nmodels, the generation and treatment of physical waste ﬂows\\ncan be calculated. Recent examples of such studies, called waste\\nfootprints, include the analysis of solid waste generation and treat-ment at global level ( Tisserant et al., 2017 ), cumulative waste pro-\\nduction induced by Australian consumers ( Fry et al., 2016 )o r\\nwaste induced by consumption of Tokyo residents ( Tsukui et al.,\\n2015 ). Waste performance indicators that can be derived from\\nwaste IOA are the multipliers from the direct and total require-\\nment matrices that determine the waste production and treatment\\nintensity of sectors. Fry et al. (2016) , for example, use the waste\\nproduction multipliers (t/$ millions) to compare the sectoral waste\\nproduction intensity and found signiﬁcant differences between\\ntwo domestic regions.\\n1.5. Objective and scope of the study\\nThe aim of this research is to analyse the current state of Brus-\\nsels’ waste management system and to identify its waste preven-\\ntion and CE valorisation potential. The scope of the study\\nincludes all kind of non-hazardous, solid waste collected from\\nhouseholds and economic activities. We develop waste supply85 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 and use tables for Brussels and use this framework it to analyse the\\ncity’s waste metabolism, because it provides an economy-wide\\nscope while maintaining the high sector detail that is required\\nfor an analysis of waste performance and valorisation potential.\\nSection 2 presents the data and method used to construct waste\\nsupply and use tables at the city level. Section 3 presents results\\nfrom the waste metabolic analysis, including the waste ﬂow tables\\nand a Sankey diagram, as well as waste performance indicators. We\\nalso discuss the outcomes in terms of CE valorisation potential.\\nSection 4 presents the conclusions that can be drawn from the dif-\\nferent analyses.\\n2. Data and methods\\nIn this study, we use the WIO framework to perform the anal-\\nysis of waste ﬂow and waste performance. The various waste\\ntables that are part of the accounting framework offer different\\nperspectives on the ﬂows of waste: a waste-type, sector- and\\ntreatment-speciﬁc perspective. The ﬁrst step of our approach\\nwas to complete data and to estimate the total amount of col-\\nlected waste (Section 2.1). This completed dataset fed into the\\nsecond step, the construction of the detailed waste supply and\\nuse tables (2.2). In step 3, we developed the waste treatment allo-cation table for Brussels (2.3) followed by the construction of the\\nwaste supply to treatment table (2.4). In the last step, we aggre-\\ngated data from the different tables to visualise them in a Sankey\\ndiagram (2.5). The waste performance indicators selected in this\\nstudy are presented in 2.6.\\n2.1. Data collection and treatment\\n2.1.1. Waste statistical data\\nDue to its status as city-region, statistical data on MSW is avail-\\nable. MSW, which represents around 30% of the total waste,\\nincludes household and similar commercial, industrial and institu-\\ntional waste collected by or on behalf of municipal authorities.\\nThus, the fractions not similar to household waste (C&D waste,\\nmetal scraps, vehicles, etc.) or the waste collected by private oper-\\nators (e.g. bulky or WEEE) are not included. For these waste frac-\\ntions only estimations of the waste amounts exist, presented in\\nhighly aggregated waste categories (for example ‘waste from com-\\npanies and administration’, ‘other waste’).\\nIn order to improve the initial data situation and to determine\\nthe total amount of solid, non-hazardous waste collected in Brus-\\nsels, we collected data from the three entities involved in the waste\\nmanagement or in the monitoring of waste data: (1) the regionalagency ‘ Bruxelles-Propreté’ who is the main collector of MSW, (2)\\n‘Bruxelles Environnement ’, the environmental administration of\\nBrussels in charge of the waste register monitoring all waste types\\nthat need to be registered and (3) the statistical ofﬁce ‘ Recydata ’\\nthat monitors waste ﬂows collected by private collectors\\n(RECYDATA, 2014 ). The collected datasets were analysed and then\\ncombined into a joint database ( Towa et al., 2017 ). It contains\\ndetailed data on solid, non-hazardous waste collected in 2010\\nand 2014 and is available in two formats: The ﬁrst one represents\\nthe waste collection system operating in Brussels where waste\\ndata is measured in, for example, tons of mixed residual waste col-\\nlected in white bags/container. The second format is waste-type\\nspeciﬁc and represents materials, such as glass, inert, metals, etc.\\nThis waste-type speciﬁc dataset was calculated from the original\\ndata by applying waste composition ratios from composition anal-\\nyses ( Agence Bruxelles Proprété (ABP), 2015; RECYDATA, 2017 ).\\nTable 1 presents the amounts of waste in the waste-type speciﬁc\\nformat.2.1.2. Input-output tables\\nFor Belgium, interregional supply and use tables as well as\\ninput-output tables are available, which model the economic ﬂows\\nof products between Brussels, the two other Belgian regions (i.e.\\nthe Walloon and Flemish region), Europe and non-Europe. The\\noriginal interregional model available from the Belgian statistical\\nauthorities ( BFP et al., 2015 ), was developed by disaggregating\\nthe national input-output system by means of top-down methods\\nand consistent with the Regional Accounts. The regional supply\\ntables specify the monetary output for each economic sector in\\nthe three Belgian regions. The model was extended by environ-\\nmental data and coupled with EXIOBASE for the import ﬂows\\n(Zeller, 2017 ). In the extended model, Brussels’ economy is struc-\\ntured into 81 sectors (plus households) that produce and consume\\n81 types of products and services. This economic input–outputframework that follows the sector classiﬁcation, listed in the sup-\\nplementary material (supplement 1), builds the general structure\\nfor the developed waste extensions (2.2 and 2.4).\\n2.2. Waste supply and use tables\\nThis section describes the construction of the waste supply and\\nuse tables. In our accounting based on waste statistical data, waste\\nis deﬁned in a narrow sense without by-products or recovered prod-ucts or materials\\n2.Table 2 shows the layout of the waste supply table\\n(W(S)) for Brussels. It is a waste type by economic activity table whose\\ncomponents wðsÞkjand wðsÞkfshow the amount of waste type k(in\\nton) generated by an economic activity jor by the ﬁnal demand sec-\\ntors f(i.e. households). The data and methodology to construct the\\nwaste supply table for Brussels 81 economic activities is documented\\nin (Zeller et al., 2018 ). In brief, we distributed the statistical data from\\nTable 1 over economic activities and households based on a waste-\\ntype speciﬁc allocation key. To derive this key, we calculated sector-\\nspeciﬁc waste intensities from the Belgian dataset in EXIOBASE v. 2\\n(NTNU et al., 2015 ) and scaled them to the economic output of each\\nsector that is given in Brussels’ supply data ( BFP et al., 2015 ). The\\nresults, i.e. the estimated amounts per type of waste and per sector,\\nare then expressed as percentage contributions to the total waste gen-\\neration for a speciﬁc type of waste. For example, the allocation key for\\nfood waste allocates 8% of the food waste from economic activities to\\nthe hotels, restaurants and catering sector (Horeca).\\nThe total waste supply wðsÞkis given by\\nwðsÞk¼X\\njwðsÞkjþwðsÞkf ð1ÞTable 1\\nTotal waste quantities collected in Brussels in 2010 and 2014 .\\n2010 (ton) 2014 (ton) Variation (%)\\nGlass 38,507 39,097 1.5\\nInert 625,244 652,869 4.4Metals 191,144 200,317 4.8Food waste 160,182 160,014 /C00.1\\nPaper & cardboard 192,170 186,900 /C02.7\\nPlastic 105,313 102,625 /C02.6\\nTextile 23,316 25,660 10.1Wood 64,131 63,276 /C01.3\\nGarden 35,103 41,305 17.7\\nOther 82,450 66,558 /C019.3\\nTotal 1,517,561 1,538,620 1.4\\n2Waste that is sent to reuse and recovery is included, for example plastic waste\\nthat is sent to a sorting facility. The recovered materials from a treatment activity, i.e.\\nthe outputs of the material recovery sector (for example sorted and pressed PET) thatare going to be used in the manufacturing sector (for example plastic recycling sector)are not additionally accounted as waste, but as an economic product ﬂow. By-products constitute a fraction of around 15% of the total products supplied in Brusselsin 2010 (based on the economic value).V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 86 Table 3 shows the structure of the waste use table (W(U)). It is a\\nwaste type by economic activity table whose components show\\nthe use of waste wuðÞkjin the local waste treatment sectors or\\nthe use of waste wuðÞkfin an exterior waste treatment sector (i.e.\\nwaste export). Compared to other authors ( Nakamura and Kondo,\\n2002 ), we account the use of waste only in a waste treatment\\nactivity, not in another sector. This difference is closely linked to\\nthe deﬁnition of waste given above: When by-products and recov-\\nered materials are not included, only the conventional waste treat-\\nment sectors use waste as an input.\\nThe total amount of waste treated wðuÞkis given by\\nwðuÞk¼X\\njwðuÞkjþwðuÞkf ð2Þ\\nThe waste treatment sector in Brussels consists of the material\\nrecovery, incineration and composting sector. Other possible waste\\ntreatment sectors (e.g. anaerobic digestion or landﬁll) do not exist\\nin Brussels and are therefore not mentioned as economic activitiesinTable 3 . The material recovery sector is a heterogeneous sector\\ngrouping (i) dismantling activities and (ii) mechanical or chemical\\ntransformation processes, also including separating and sorting of\\nrecoverable materials (code 37 in NACE rev.1.1). The sector is\\ncalled ‘preparation for material recovery’ in the following in order\\nto emphasize that the activities carried out in Brussels are mainly\\nseparation, sorting and dismantling activities.\\nIn order to determine the input-output ﬂows of this sector, we\\ncollected physical and economic data from companies assigned to\\nthis sector\\n3. The total amounts of waste incinerated and compostedare published in annual reports (Bruxelles Propreté, 2014 ). The\\nmaterial composition of waste incinerated was derived from waste\\nbags/container composition analyses ( Agence Bruxelles Proprété\\n(ABP), 2015; RECYDATA, 2017 ). The amount of exported waste\\nwas calculated by subtracting the amounts of waste treated in\\nBrussels from the total amounts of waste collected. Thus, in the\\nwaste use table, the export column is a balancing item and repre-\\nsents the theoretical direct export of waste. When accounting also\\nfor the export of recovered products from the local material recov-\\nery sector (for example the sorted PET), the export share is signif-\\nicantly higher.\\n2.3. Waste treatment allocation table\\nW(S) and W(U) determine the amounts of waste collected and\\nthe total amounts of waste used in the waste treatment sectors.\\nThey do not determine how a certain waste type produced by a\\ncertain sector is treated. In order to make this correspondence\\nbetween generation and treatment at sector level, an additional\\ntable is needed that determines waste treatment rates per waste\\ntype. The so-called waste treatment allocation table (S), introduced\\nbyNakamura and Kondo (2002) , is a waste treatment by waste\\ntype table whose components sikshow the share of waste type k\\nthat is treated by a certain treatment method i. The sum of waste\\ntreatment shares for a speciﬁc waste type kis 1.\\nTo determine the waste-speciﬁc treatment rates, we used vari-\\nous sources. Data on the destination of waste from economic activ-\\nities is taken from the waste register ( Bruxelles Environnement,\\n2016 ), a monitoring study ( RECYDATA, 2014 ), and based on direct\\ncontacts with waste collectors and waste treatment facilities. For\\nhousehold and assimilated waste, data from the public agency\\nABP that monitors the treatment of MSW is used ( Agence\\nBruxelles Proprété (ABP), 2016 ). The use of such datasets toTable 2\\nStructure of the waste supply table.\\nHH = Households, EA = Economic activity.\\nTable 3\\nStructure of the waste use table .\\nHH = Households, EA = Economic activity.\\n3Companies assigned to this sector are 4 private companies with sites in Brussels\\nand active in the separation of C&D, bulky and metal waste (using around 80% of thewaste treated by this sector); 1 private–public company sorting plastic bottles, metalpackaging and drink cartons (PMD), paper and cardboard; around 10 small socialwork integration social enterprises active in the dismantling of WEEE and sorting ofbulky and textile waste.87 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 construct the waste treatment allocation table could be a potential\\napproach for other cities as well4.\\nAfter determining the treatment processes for an aggregated\\nwaste ﬂows (for example mixed residual waste), the ﬂows weredisaggregated per waste type. Table 4 presents the waste treat-\\nment shares per waste type for economic activities, Table 5 for\\nhouseholds. We distinguished the local treatment modes (prepara-\\ntion for material recovery, reuse, incineration and composting) and\\nthe exterior treatment processes which include also anaerobic\\ndigestion, landﬁll and the category ‘unknown’ if the ﬁnal destina-\\ntion of the waste could not be determined. The low landﬁll rate\\nis a result of Belgium’s high landﬁll tax (one of the highest landﬁll\\ntaxes in Europe), combined with a landﬁll ban for several selected\\nwaste streams ( Gentil, 2013 ).\\n2.4. Waste supply to treatment table\\nWhen multiplying (S) from the left by W(S), we receive the\\nwaste supply to treatment table (W(ST)). More precisely, the treat-\\nment shares for economic activities ( s\\nikfrom S1) are multiplied by\\nthe waste collected from economic activities ( wðsÞkj). Accordingly,\\nthe treatment shares for households ( sikfrom S2) are multiplied\\nby waste collected from households ( wðsÞkf).Table 6 shows the\\nstructure of the resulting table. It is a waste treatment by economicactivity table whose components ws tðÞijdetermine the amount of\\nwaste, supplied by each sector, that are sent to a speciﬁc waste\\ntreatment activity.

Data aggregation\\nTo visualise the ﬂows of waste from origin to their destination\\nwe constructed a Sankey diagram based on aggregated data from\\nTable 7 and 9 . Sankey diagrams visualise energy or material ﬂows\\nby scaling the size of the ﬂows (arrows) proportional to the ﬂow\\nquantity ( Schmidt, 2008 ).\\nFor the purpose of clarity, the 81 economic activities have been\\naggregated into 10 groups, such as primary industries, manufactur-\\ning, construction, etc. The correspondence table (supplement 2)\\nshows the alignment of economic activities to the 10 aggregated\\ngroups. We mainly follow the aggregation proposed by the hierar-\\nchical levels used in the NACE system, but extended the group fur-\\nther if the waste amount was too small to be displayed (example:\\nthe ‘energy and water’ sector was included into ‘manufacturing’).\\nIn addition to the 10 aggregated economic activities, we added\\nthe household sector and a further grouped sector called ‘non-\\nspeciﬁed economic activity’. This sector contains ﬂows which could\\nnot be aligned to a speciﬁc economic activity.Table 4\\nWaste treatment allocation table (S1) for economic activities .\\nGlass Inert Metals Food Paper Plastic Textile Wood Garden Other\\nPrep. for mat. rec. 0.00 0.26 0.45 0.00 0.16 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\\nReuse 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00Incineration 0.35 0.01 0.07 0.89 0.30 0.75 1.00 0.33 0.30 0.85Composting 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.21 0.00Ex. to mat. rec. 0.65 0.42 0.49 0.03 0.55 0.02 0.00 0.45 0.00 0.15Ex. to inc. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.06 0.00 0.00Ex. to comp. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.50 0.00Ex. to landf. 0.00 0.13 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\\nEx. to AD. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.08 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\\nEx. to unk. 0.00 0.18 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.22 0.00 0.16 0.00 0.00Ex. to reuse 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\\nPrep. for mat. rec. = Preparation for material recovery; Ex. = Export; Mat. rec. = Material recovery; inc. = incineration; comp. = composting; landf. = landﬁll; AD. = anaerobic\\ndigestion; unk. = unknown.\\nTable 5\\nWaste treatment allocation table (S2) for households.\\nGlass Inert Metals Food Paper Plastic Textile Wood Garden Other\\nPrep. for mat. rec 0.00 0.27 0.47 0.00 0.55 0.10 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\\nReuse 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.11 0.05 0.00Incineration 0.20 0.00 0.09 1.00 0.45 0.52 0.75 0.45 0.44 0.85\\nComposting 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.56 0.00\\nEx. to mat. rec. 0.80 0.73 0.43 0.00 0.00 0.37 0.04 0.50 0.00 0.15Ex. to inc. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00Ex. to comp. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00Ex. to landf. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00Ex. to AD. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00Ex. to unk. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00Ex. to reuse 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.10 0.00 0.00 0.00\\nPrep. for mat. rec. = Preparation for material recovery; Ex. = Export; Mat. rec. = Material recovery; inc. = incineration; comp. = composting; landf. = landﬁll; AD. = anaerobic\\ndigestion; unk. = unknown.\\n4Waste registers, which seem to be available in many cities, have the purpose to\\nregister waste carriers, brokers and dealers. These waste service providers have to\\ndeclare the amount (in mass) and type of collected waste, and the destination of the\\nwaste. In the speciﬁc case of Brussels, an anonymized version of this dataset could beaccessed by the researchers, but it needed to be combined with other data sources(from monitoring studies and direct contacts with waste collectors and wastetreatment facilities) to identify and solve declarations errors and eliminate doublecounting (Towa et al. 2016).V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 88 In order to visualise local material cycles we also added to the\\ndiagram the ﬂows of the secondary waste from incineration (i.e.\\nbottom ash, ﬂy ash, metal residues etc.) and ﬂows of secondary\\nraw materials (recovered materials like sorted PET) produced in\\nBrussels. The numerical tables behind the Sankey are given in sup-\\nplement 3.\\n2.6. Waste performance indicators\\nTo measure and compare the waste performance of the city’s\\nsectors, the two indicators ‘waste production intensity’ and ‘waste\\ntreatment intensity’ are chosen, because they measure two impor-\\ntant aspects of a sector’s performance: the sector’s waste (in)efﬁ-\\nciency in terms of amount of waste and type of treatment. The\\nwaste production intensity reﬂects the sector’s production (in)efﬁ-\\nciency and is expressed as a ratio between waste and production. It\\nis calculated by dividing each component of the waste supply table\\nwðsÞkj(see 2.2) by the economic activity output xjfrom Brussels’\\nsupply table. The waste intensity is measured in ton per M €sector\\noutput.\\nIn order to take into account not only the amounts of generated\\nwaste, but also the type of treatment, the waste treatment inten-\\nsity is used as second indicator. It refers to the amount of wasteproduced by a sector (in ton) that is sent to a speciﬁc treatment\\n(for example to incineration or recycling). It is calculated by divid-\\ning each component of the supply to treatment table ws tðÞ\\nij(2.4)\\nby the economic activity output xjfrom Brussels’ supply table.\\nThe waste treatment intensity is also measured in ton per M €sec-\\ntor output. Since the economic sector output is only available for\\n2010, the waste coefﬁcients are calculated for 2010.\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Waste ﬂow analysis3.1.1. Waste supply and use tables\\nThe results of the waste supply table for Brussels are shown in\\nTable 7 . The ten waste types are broad categories containing differ-\\nent ‘product’ types produced by households and economic activi-\\nties. For example, ‘glass’ includes ﬂat glass from end of life\\nvehicles and from C&D activities, but also packaging glass disposed\\nby households and the hotels and restaurant sector. The category\\n‘inert’ contains concrete, bricks, tiles and ceramics, inert mixture,\\nasphalt, soil and stones. The category ‘other’ is a mixed fraction\\nconsisting mostly of ‘complex packaging’, ‘ﬁne particles’ or ‘street\\ncleaning residues’.\\nThe total amount of waste collected in 2014 is around 1.5 mil-\\nlion tons, from which 71% is generated by economic activities and29% by households. Table 7 shows that households are the most\\nimportant contributor for glass, food, textile and garden waste,\\nwhile inert, metal and paper and cardboard are mainly produced\\nby economic activities.\\nThe sector-speciﬁc results are too detailed to be reproduced\\nhere, but available in the supplementary material (supplement\\n4). The results show that only for inert waste a large share (31%\\nof inert waste) can be aligned to one particular sector, the con-\\nstruction sector. For the other waste types, the amounts are more\\nwidely distributed over economic activities. For example, for paper\\nwaste, the public administration, ﬁnancial intermediation and the\\nother business services have a share of 15%, 11% and 9% respec-\\ntively and the remaining part is distributed over 62 economic\\nactivities.\\nWhen discussing the quality of this detailed sector repartition,\\nwe point to the following sources of uncertainties: First, for certain\\nsectors the local economic output speciﬁed in the supply table\\ncould be higher than their real production (so called ‘head quarter\\nproblem’) and second, the national waste intensity could under- or\\noverestimate the regional waste intensity. Previous comparison\\nbetween estimations based on waste coefﬁcient approach and sta-\\ntistical data ( Zeller et al., 2018 ) have shown that uncertainties\\noccur mainly for metals, glass and inert waste.\\nTable 8 shows the amount of waste used in the local waste\\ntreatment facilities (i.e. input capacities) and the amount of waste\\nexported to waste treatment facilities located out of Brussels.\\nAround 770 kt of waste (50% of the total) is treated in Brussels,\\nthe remaining 50% is directly exported. Regarding the data quality,\\nit has to be mentioned that the totals for incineration and compost-\\ning represent accurate numbers measured by the treatment facili-\\nties, while the quantity for the ‘preparation for material recovery’sector and the detailed, waste-type speciﬁc inputs represents esti-\\nmations obtained from the sources previously described ( Agence\\nBruxelles Proprété (ABP), 2016 ; Bruxelles Propreté, 2016;\\nRECYDATA, 2017, 2014 ).\\nTable 9 is the waste supply to treatment table that shows\\ntreatment- and sector-speciﬁc results. Most waste collected from\\nhouseholds is used in the local treatment facilities while waste col-\\nlected from economic activities is mainly exported. The treatment\\noptions ‘export to incineration, unknown, landﬁll and compost’\\noccur for waste from economic activities only. These variations in\\ntreatment between economic activities and the household sector\\nresult from the different collection schemes and actors (public/pri-\\nvate) responsible for the collection of waste. When comparing the\\namount of waste sent to the local ‘preparation of material recovery’\\nsector and to the local incinerator, indicated in Table 9 , with the\\ncorresponding data from Table 8 , we ﬁnd that the calculated\\namounts in Table 9 are slightly lower than the ones ‘measured’\\nin the use tables. This indicates that incineration rates and materialTable 6\\nWaste supply to treatment table.\\nHH = Households, EA = Economic activity.89 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 recovery shares that are used in the calculation are slightly under-\\nestimated for certain waste fractions. However, the overall mass\\nbalance between the three tables (Eq. (4)) is maintained.\\n3.1.2. Waste ﬂow analysis (sankey diagram)\\nTo represent waste ﬂows in a Sankey diagram, we used aggre-\\ngated versions of Table 7 andTable 9 (2.5.). On the left of the dia-\\ngram ( Fig. 1 ) the origin of waste is shown, represented by 12 sector\\ngroups. The size of each sector box represents the contribution of\\neach sector to the total amount of waste collected in Brussels.\\nWe observe that households and construction are the most impor-\\ntant contributing sectors to the total waste ﬂow, representing 29%and 16% respectively. The composition of each sector’s waste ﬂow\\nis represented by several single ﬂow arrows leaving the sector box.\\nWe can see that the collected waste from households is heteroge-\\nneously composed, in contrast to the waste from the construction\\nsector that is dominated by inert waste.\\nThe single waste ﬂows end in a waste treatment activity, which\\nmight be located within or outside of Brussels. The sum ﬂow\\narrows indicate the contribution of each waste treatment activity\\nto the overall waste management system: 27% of the total collected\\nwaste goes to the incinerator, 11% to inert recovery, 10% to other\\nintermediate treatment processes (such as PMD, paper and textile\\nsorting and metal recovery) and 1% to the city’s compostingTable 7\\nWaste supply table (Brussels 2014).\\nWaste type (k) Economic activities (j)\\n123 ...81Total\\n(1–81)Final demand\\nHH(ton per year)Imports Total\\nEA + HH\\nGlass 14,099 24,998 – 39,097\\nInert 556,608 96,260 – 652,869\\nMetals 167,232 33,084 – 200,317\\nFood waste 55,000 105,014 – 160,014Paper & cardboard 126,315 60,586 – 186,900Plastic 57,517 45,108 – 102,625\\nTextile 11,132 14,528 – 25,660\\nWood 42,789 20,487 – 63,276\\nGarden waste 14,856 26,449 – 41,305Other 39,634 26,924 – 66,558\\nTotal 1,085,183 453,437 – 1,538,620\\nHH = Households, EA = Economic activity.\\nTable 8\\nWaste use table (Brussels 2014).\\nWaste type (k) Economic activities (j) Total\\n1–81Final demand Total\\nEA + Exp.123 ...

Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 90 facility. Thus, in total around 50% of the collected waste is treated\\nwithin the city limits. The remaining waste is sent out of Brussels\\nto be treated: 5% goes to landﬁll5, 36% is recycled and the remaining\\n9% is subject to other treatment processes (composting, anaerobic\\ndigestion, incineration and unknown). In addition to all of these\\nprimary waste ﬂows, we also included the secondary waste ﬂow\\nfrom incineration indicating the proportion that is landﬁlled or sent\\nto recycling.\\nThe diagonal-shaded ﬂows in Fig. 1 show secondary raw mate-\\nrials or products recovered from the intermediate treatment pro-\\ncesses. These materials and products are mostly exported to\\nrecycling facilities in Belgium, Europe or the rest of the world, with\\nonly a small amount being reused at city level: 6kt of compost\\n(from 18kt of garden waste, 64% sold to users in Brussels), 1.5ktof textiles, 1kt of wood, 0.6kt of plastics and 0.3kt of metals. This\\nmeans that less than 1% of the total collected waste is used in a\\nway that closes material cycles at city level. In addition to these\\nlocal material cycles, the incineration plant with energy recovery\\ncould be considered as a local energy cycle. Around 5% of Brussels’\\nhouseholds can be supplied with electricity from the incinerator.\\nThis energy ﬂow is not represented in this mass-related Sankey\\ndiagram.\\nThe sum ﬂow arrows for waste and secondary raw material on\\nthe right of the diagram show the current state of waste treatment\\nin terms of the quantity dealt with by each treatment mode and\\nwhether this occurs within or outside the city. Nonetheless, as pre-\\nviously mentioned, the data (and therefore by deﬁnition the anal-\\nysis) has certain limitations. It is based on the quantities of\\ncollected waste and does not take account of products being reused\\nbefore collection. For example, this is why we see textile reuse in\\nthe form of clothes collected in containers and afterwards (partly)\\nreused, but not clothes sold second-hand. Likewise, the data does\\nnot account for products that are (re-)sold on markets, sold\\nbetween individuals or that are donated. Due to the variety ofproducts and reuse exchange possibilities, this part of the CE which\\nis already in place could not be quantiﬁed and is not represented in\\nthe diagram\\n6.\\nFurthermore, since the diagram aims to present the origin and\\nﬁnal destination of waste ﬂows, intermediate collection points or\\nﬂows between the waste treatment facilities are not illustrated.\\nFor example, sorting residues from the PMD and paper sorting\\nfacility that are sent to incineration are not illustrated as a separate\\nﬂow between sorting facility and incinerator, but included in the\\ninput ﬂows to the incineration plant. In reality, 250 registered\\nactors participate in waste collection and treatment in Brussels,\\nand various interactions occur between actors.\\n3.2. Waste performance analysis\\nIn this section we analyse the waste performance of the city’s\\nsectors based on two indicators: the waste production and the\\nwaste treatment intensity (2.6).\\nTable 10 shows the waste production intensity (measured in\\nton/M €) for the aggregated sectors (see 2.5). Since the primary sec-\\ntor has almost no practical relevance for Brussels, we can exclude it\\nfrom the discussion. The results show that the service sectors have\\na lower waste production intensity (between 2.72 ton/M €to 8.86\\nton/M €) compared to the other sectors (up to 41.31 ton/M €). The\\nwaste intensity of the manufacturing sector is slightly lower\\n(7.27 ton/M €) than the transport and communication sector. This\\nindicates that Brussels’ manufacturing sector has few production-\\nintensive industries. The household sector has the second highest\\nwaste production intensity. The highest intensity occurs for the\\nconstruction sector, due to its high share of (heavy) inert waste.\\nWhen comparing sectors by waste type, we ﬁnd highest inten-\\nsity for glass waste in the Horeca sector. For inert, metals and wood\\nwaste the waste production intensity is highest in the construction\\nComp.= composting; Inc.= inci neration; AD.= Anaerobic digestion \\nFig. 1. Sankey diagram of waste and secondary raw material ﬂows (Brussels 2014). Comp. = composting; Inc. = incineration; AD. = Anaerobic digestion.\\n5The low landﬁll rate is a general pattern in Belgium, where around 8% of the total\\nwaste was landﬁlled in 2014 ( Eurostat, 2018d ).6An estimation of the second hand market in UK has shown amounts of around\\n180kt of products sold on car boot and furniture reuse markets ( Gregson et al., 2013 )\\nwhich represents 0.1% compared to the annually non-hazardous waste generated.91 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 sector; for food, paper and plastic waste in the household sector\\nand for textile waste in the sector ‘other non-sales services’.\\nTable 11 shows the waste treatment intensity (measured in\\nton/M €) for the aggregated sectors. Again, we can ignore the\\nresults for the primary sector. The treatment intensity results from\\nthe speciﬁc mix of waste produced by a sector and the waste-type\\nspeciﬁc treatment rates. Households show the highest intensity of\\nincineration, but also second highest intensity of local material\\nrecovery. The construction sector has highest local material recov-\\nery rates (i.e. preparation for material recovery). The regional\\nmaterial recovery consists mainly of sorting and crushing activities\\nof the inert fraction. The produced recycled aggregates are used in\\nvarious applications, for instance, for road base and ﬁlling materi-als in road construction (downcycling).\\nThe two presented indicators show the direct waste intensity,\\ni.e. the amount of waste produced directly by an economic activity\\nor households, without including waste generated upstream in the\\nsupply chain as a result of products supplied to the sector. The\\ndirect waste production intensity has been analysed by various\\nauthors, but the comparison of values is difﬁcult due to differences\\nin sector classiﬁcation and monetary reference values. For exam-\\nple, Reynolds et al. (2014) found highest waste intensity for the\\nconstruction sector, but in the aggregated results it is classiﬁed\\nas a service sector, so that service sectors have highest direct waste\\nintensities. High direct waste intensities for the primary, construc-\\ntion, and transport and communication sectors were also found by\\nReynolds et al. (2014) and Nakamura et al. (2007) . Regarding the\\nwaste treatment intensity, comparisons with other studies reveal\\nstrong differences due to different waste treatment schemesestablished in the respective region under study. For example,\\nthe comparison between countries in Tisserant et al. (2017) reveals\\nthat recycling is the dominant treatment method in many\\nEuropean countries while it is landﬁll in, for example, Brazil,\\nMexico or Russia, and incineration in Japan.\\n3.3. Circular economy valorisation and waste prevention potential\\nThe results from waste supply and use tables and the associated\\nSankey diagram were used to identify the non-exploited valorisa-\\ntion potential of Brussels’ waste ﬂows. This is important informa-\\ntion for decision-makers implementing CE models. Regarding the\\nranking of treatment/valorisation options, we rely on the gener-\\nalised environmental ranking of the waste hierarchy (see 1.1).\\nSince waste prevention at source is the highest priority in the Euro-\\npean and regional waste plans, we also interpreted the results in\\nterms of their waste prevention potential.\\nWhen using Fig. 1 to identify potential waste prevention\\noptions, the sector contribution and waste composition analysis\\ncan provide useful information. The household sector was identi-\\nﬁed as the most important single contributor (at 29%) and sector\\nwith second highest waste production intensity. The household\\nsector is also the main focus of the current prevention strategy in\\nBrussels’ Waste Plan. However, when considering the total waste\\nﬂow for the city, the importance of the remaining sectors (eco-\\nnomic activities) becomes evident: Especially, the construction\\nsector that is the second highest single contributor (at 16%) and\\nthe sector with highest waste production intensity.

Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83 (2018) 83–94 92 also an important target sector for prevention measures. However,\\nwaste production intensity is lower than for example the one from\\nhouseholds. The current Waste Plan provides quantitative preven-\\ntion targets for food, paper and plastic, but when comparing these\\npriorities with the composition of the waste ﬂows, we note that the\\nbiggest ﬂow in terms of mass is missing: the inert waste ﬂow. Thus,\\nit is clear that prevention policies need to be extended to all waste\\ntypes and need to target economic activities as well.\\nWhen analysing the Sankey to identify new CE valorisation\\noptions with the priority on material recovery as suggested by\\nthe waste hierarchy, we focus on the waste treatment options that\\ndo not yet close material cycles (at local or global level). When\\napplying this focus ,we identify the possibility to redirect waste\\nﬂows from the incinerator towards material reuse or recycling as\\nmeasure with highest potential for Brussels. The reduction ofwaste ﬂows going to the incinerator implies to increase the sorting\\nefﬁciency at source, but also to expand the options of separate sort-\\ning. In this context, one stream is of particular importance due to\\nits size and current treatment: the ﬂow of food waste that is cur-\\nrently incinerated. Separate collection of this stream and valorisa-\\ntion in composting or anaerobic digestion could contribute to the\\nclosing of material cycles.\\nWhen discussing the options for the local CE valorisation poten-\\ntial, which is the focus adopted by the regional CE plan (1.3), it is\\nhelpful to distinguish between (i) preparation for material recovery\\n(ii) and material recovery/reprocessing. The existing local facilities\\nand actors, active in the collection and sorting of textiles, bulky\\nwaste, dismantling of WEEE or separation of plastic, paper and\\nmetals, belong to the ﬁrst type of valorisation. The extension of\\nsuch activities would imply to increase the amount of products\\nwith reuse or recycling potential, for example by improving access\\nto collection points, by improving separation at source and exten-\\nsion of collections that maintain product quality. Furthermore, the\\nlocal sorting/dismantling infrastructure could be extended, for\\nexample by an additional sorting line for plastics that are not sep-\\narated and recycled today, bulky waste sorting or WEEE\\ndismantling.\\nHowever, the implementation of the second type of valorisation\\ncan be limited at city scale by techno-economic constraints, as dis-\\ncussed in 1.2. Only speciﬁc waste types, such as organic wastes,\\nmixed MSW, and demolition wastes are considered to be suitable\\nfor local material recycling and energy recovery. Thus, setting\\nagain the priority on the unexploited potential for material recov-\\nery, the highest CE valorisation potential occurs for organic waste\\nby extending the existing composting capacity, to invest in anaer-\\nobic digestion or in a combination of both. The export of waste to\\ncomposting, anaerobic digestion and incineration facilities outside\\nof Brussels should be avoided if local valorisation is priority. How-ever, potential changes in the waste management system need to\\nbe further assessed based on LCAs that consider not only the\\npotential beneﬁts of avoided transport, but also the efﬁciency of\\nthe complete waste treatment chain.\\n4. Conclusions and outlook\\nBy using the waste input-output framework, we were able to\\nclose data gaps and to increase the level of detail in the waste data.\\nThis could contribute in empirically identifying the waste ﬂows\\nwith the most promising CE valorisation potential for cities such\\nas Brussels. The valorisation potential was identiﬁed here based\\non the generalised ranking of the waste hierarchy and needs to\\nbe completed by an LCA that compares the environmental perfor-\\nmances of different valorisation options.\\nThe datasets we developed enabled us to perform waste-type,\\nsector- and treatment-speciﬁc analyses of urban waste ﬂows.Compared with conventional EW-MFAs based on statistical data,\\nthe urban waste metabolism presented in this study is more\\ndetailed and offers more possibilities in terms of its application.\\nHowever, this increase in detail comes at a cost; the procedures\\nof data conversion, alignment and disaggregation inherently\\nresulted in additional uncertainties. Highest uncertainties occur\\nfor metals, glass and inert waste amounts and their distribution\\nover economic sectors.\\nFurthermore, a general limitation of the approach is that the\\nstarting point is the amount of collected waste and not the amount\\nof used products. Thus, the role of CE measures based on products\\ncould not be fully captured in this study. This limitation could be\\nreduced by extending the waste input-output framework to phys-\\nical product ﬂows.\\nIn this study we have developed waste supply and use tables as\\nindependent tables appended to economic supply and use tables\\nthat monitor product ﬂows. However, to use the full analytical\\npower of IO analyses, i.e. to calculate waste footprints and environ-\\nmental impacts, the integration of these tables into the product\\nﬂow matrix is needed, as demonstrated in Lenzen and Reynolds\\n(2014) and Nakamura and Kondo (2002) .\\nThis study could ﬁnd few examples of systems which closed\\nmaterial cycles at city level. However, Brussels has adopted a CE\\nplan in 2016 only. To increase the rates of reuse and of material\\nrecycling, we identiﬁed target streams and proposed measures to\\nexploit the unused valorisation potential. However, when consid-\\nering the context of cities with a highly urbanized terrain, it\\nbecomes evident that closing material cycles at city level may only\\nwork to a certain extent and is limited to certain ﬂows. Thus we see\\nthe role of cities (such as Brussels) in a CE mainly as provider of\\nreusable products, recyclable materials (such as paper, plastics,\\nmetals, glass) and nutrients from organic waste rather than circu-\\nlarity islands. Whether the closing of material cycles at city level\\nhas environmental beneﬁts compared to the national or global\\nlevel, needs to be further assessed based on comparative LCA\\nstudies.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis research is conducted in the frame of the BRUCETRA pro-\\nject funded by the Brussels’ capital region – Innoviris (2015-\\nPRFB-3a).\\nAppendix A.

This study ex-\\namines the current efforts on recycling of the waste by extended producer responsibility (EPR) in South Korea aswell as other countries. Material flow analysis (MFA) was performed on plastic packaging by life cycle. Based on\\nthe results in this study, material footprint of common single use plastics (i.e., PET water bottles, plastic cups,\\nplastic bags, and plasticcontainers and cutlery by food delivery) by consumption was estimated to be on average11.8 kg or 638 disposable plastics per capita a year, resulting in 32.6 billion disposable plastics and 603,000 ton\\nof waste for disposal in South Korea. Approximately, 3 million ton of plastic packaging waste from household\\nwaste streams in 2017 in South Korea was generated and treated by energy recovery with solid refuse fuels andheat recovery, incineration without energy recovery, material recycling, and landfilling. Material recycling andrecovery rates of plastic packaging waste from households were relativelylow at13.5% and50.5%, respectively.\\nIt was estimated that as much as 3.6 million ton of CO\\n2eq was generated from 2.7 million ton of plastic waste by\\nincineration in 2017. Approximately 6.6 million ton CO 2eq could be avoided by material recycling. Challenges\\nand efforts have been discussed to improve current recycling system of plastic packaging waste towards a cir-cular economy.\\n1. Introduction\\nPackaging materials such as papers, paper boards, plastics, alu-\\nminum, steel cans, and glass/jars are commonly used for enclosing or\\nprotecting products during distribution, storage, sale, delivery, and use.\\nThe preference and use of such packaging materials depend on the\\ntypes of products, cost, and packing purpose. Plastic packaging has\\nbeen gaining popularity among the packaging materials due to its lower\\nprice, lightness, easy-to-use, resistance to corrosive and structural\\nproperties. High density polyethylene (HDPE), low density poly-\\nethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene\\n(PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are commonlyused plastic resins in packaging applications for a variety of products,\\nincluding bottles and tubes, packs and cups, trays, bags, caps, bubble\\nwrapping and films, containers, and many others.Plastic packagingand\\ncontainers are the largest application (36%) among industrialapplications from the worldwide plastic production (approximately 400\\nmillion per year), followed by building and construction materials\\n(16%) and textiles (14%) (Geyer et al., 2017). The global plastic pro-\\nduction is expected to continually increase from 300 million ton in\\n2015 to 1800 million ton in 2050 (Ryan, 2015).\\nThe large consumer demands for plastic packaging materials, lar-\\ngely short-term and single-use materials designed for immediate dis-\\nposal after use, have resulted in tremendous amounts of plastic waste to\\nbe managedfor treatment and disposal. Itwas estimated that more than\\n300 million ton of plastic waste was generated in 2015 (Geyer et al.,\\n2017). According to the study, approximately 79% of the waste was\\ndisposed in landfills, dumps or in the environment, while incinerationand recycling were only 12% and 9%, respectively (Geyer et al., 2017).\\nIn EU, recent statistics revealed that more than 16 million ton of plastic\\npackaging waste was produced in 2016. The material recycling rate for\\nthe packaging waste was 42.4% (approximately 6.9 million ton) on\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104798\\nReceived 31 December 2019; Received in revised form 27 February 2020; Accepted 28 February 2020⁎Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: gogator@cnu.ac.kr (Y.-C.

Recently, the European\\nCouncil, European Parliament, and European Commission made anagreement in 2017 to set a new target for plastic packaging recycling at\\n50% by 2025, to be increased to 55% by 2030\\n(European Commission, 2018). In Japan, more than 9 million ton of\\nplastic waste was generated in 2017. More than 50% of plastic waste\\nwas treated by incineration with power generation and heat recovery,\\nrefuse derived fuel and auxiliary fuels in cement kilns, while the ma-\\nterial recycling accounted for only 23% (Japan PWMI, 2019).\\nIn July 2017, the Chinese government announced that plastic waste\\nmaterials or scraps from outside China were prohibited to import in\\nChina for protecting its environment and public health because toxic\\nmaterials were often found in mixed plastic waste streams. Due to this\\naction, plastic waste that was once exported to China for recycling and\\ntreatment remains in many countries (Chinese Ministry of\\nEnvironmental Protection, 2017). A recent study reported that about\\n111 million tons of plastic waste will be displaced with the Chinese\\nimport ban by 2030 (Brooks et al., 2018). This may cause unstable\\nconditions inthe recyclingindustry by exceeding itscapacity.However,\\nit can also give an opportunity for countries that have heavily relied on\\nChina to identify better solutions to deal with ever-increasing plastic\\nwaste and establish local recycling industry.\\nSome fractions of plastic waste are commonly found in oceans,\\nbeach, coastal lines and river and streams (Raum-Suryan et al., 2009;\\nRomeo et al., 2015; Jambeck et al., 2015; Romeo et al., 2015;\\nTurner et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Alam et al., 2018). Such misman-\\nagement of the waste can cause environmental damages, ecological\\nimpacts in marine environment, and economically damages to tourisms\\n(Ashton et al., 2010b; Turner, 2016; Avio et al., 2017; SEAS AT\\nRIAK, 2017; Worm etal.,2017; Alam etal.,2018). Duringbreak-upand\\nfragmentation of the plastics by weathering, microplastics in ocean and\\nrivers can also be generated, and are becoming a significant concerndue to potentially toxic effects on biological organism in ecosystems\\n(Nakashima etal.,2011; GESAMP,2015). Themicroplasticscanactasa\\nstorage or sponge absorbing toxic chemicals in the environment (Al-Odani et al., 2015; Rani et al., 2014; Turner and Holmes, 2015;\\nJang et al., 2016; Song et al., 2019). This may create serious concerns\\nregarding the potential contamination of marine organisms that can be\\nconsumed as dietary activities by people.\\nIn response to the growing concern, many countries have been\\ntrying to develop proper management strategy and regulations on\\nplastic packaging waste in a circular economy\\n(European Commission, 2018; Marieke et al., 2018; Japan MOE, 2019;\\nKorea MOE, 2019). The circular economy is designed to transform\\ncurrent linear economic structure consisting of extraction, production,\\nconsumption and disposal stages to a circular economic structure by\\nreducing the use of limited natural resources and minimizing environ-\\nmental burdens within the economic system in our society\\n(European Commission, 2018a). In order to transform into a circular\\neconomy, life cycle of product should be considered by supporting the\\ncreation of an economy designed for circulation of resources in a cost-\\neffective and environmentally sound manner. For example, more dur-\\nable and eco-friendly products are designed and packaging using sus-\\ntainable materials which can be easily recycled are manufactured.\\nProducers take full responsibility of the recovery of resources over the\\nlife cycle of their product and packaging. Consumers can contribute to\\nthe circular economy by green consumption, asset-sharing, and product\\nreuse. Recently, EU strategy for plastics in the circular economy was\\ndeveloped to establish new plastics economy in EU along with several\\ntargets.Some specific goals with timelines include all plastic packaging\\nmaterials placed on the EU market that can be reusable or recyclable in acost-effective way by 2030, more than half of plastic waste generated in\\nEuropetoberecycledby2030,andsortingandrecyclingcapacityplasticsto\\nbe increased up toy four-fold by 2030 with the creation of 200,000 jobs,\\nalongwithimprovedseparatecollectionsofplastics,actionsonplasticswasteprevention, and legislation on single-use plastics.\\n(European Commission, 2018; Foschi and Bonoli, 2019). In Japan, “Re-\\nsource circulation strategy forplastics” was developed to reduce the useof single-use plastics, and promote the development and use of sub-\\nstitutes for petroleum-based plastics in 2018. The specific goals with\\ntimelines include the cumulative 25% reduction of single-use plastics gen-eration by 2030, reusable and recyclable design for all containers and\\npackaging/products by 2025, 60% recycling rate of plastic containers and\\npackaging by 2030, 100% effective use of used plastics by 2035 including\\ncirculareconomymeasures,doublinguseofrecycledmaterialsby2030,and\\nmaximum introduction (2 million tons) of biomass plastics by 2030\\n(Japan MOE, 2019).\\nWhile the recycling statistics of waste components are readily\\navailable in developed countries, there are still very limited studies\\nregarding environmentally sound management practices of plastic\\npackaging waste and their quantitative flow towards a circular\\neconomy (Bernardo et al., 2016; Eygen et al., 2018; Dahlbo et al., 2018;\\nMillette et al., 2019). The material flow of plastic packaging waste in\\nhouseholds is very important to develop appropriate waste manage-\\nment policy for recycling and treatment as well as to prevent plastic\\npollution in ecosystem, especially in oceans.\\nThis study presents the overview of current recycling and manage-\\nment practices of plastic packaging waste by extended producer re-\\nsponsibility (EPR) in South Korea. More specifically, our study ex-\\namined the generation, recycling rates for resource recovery, and\\ntreatment of the waste. Material flow analysis (MFA) for plastic\\npackaging was performed to provide its quantitative pathways by life\\ncycle. Material footprint of single-use plastics based on selected items\\n(single use plastic bags, plastic cups, PET water bottles, and plastic\\ncutlery) was provided to elucidate the consumption rate per capita. It\\ndiscussed recent efforts and performance regarding the recycling and\\nmanagement by comparing with Japan and selected EU countries\\n(Belgium, France, Germany, and UK). The greenhouse gas reduction\\npotentials by the recycling and source reduction of the waste were\\nevaluated by using the Waste Reduction Model (WARM) developed by\\ntheUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Finally, some\\nchallenges and efforts are discussed to improve the management of\\nplastic packaging waste towards a circular economy.\\n2. Methodology\\nThe methodology employed in this study included gathering data\\nassociated with monitoring results of waste management performed by\\nEPR and national waste generation and disposal status reported by the\\nKorea Ministry of Environment (Korea MOE), site visits to plastic re-\\ncycling facilities, having interviews and conversations with field site\\nworkers, and holding expert meetings with government, industry, and\\nacademia. We also conducted literature review of published reports and\\nscientific papers, analysis of available statistics and data of the EPR\\nsystem published by Institute European Environment Policy (IEEP),\\nOECD and EU (European Commission, 2014; Organization for\\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2016; Institute\\nEuropean Environmental Policy (IEEP) 2018).\\n2.1. Data sources and material flow analysis\\nRecentregulationsonplastic waste,scientificpapers, releasedpress,\\nand previous research report related to its recycling and disposal have\\nbeen examined. The EPR results were evaluated based on the volume\\nput on the market, recycling amounts, and recycling rate statistics of\\nplastic packaging materials (PET bottles, single and composite or multi-\\nlayer plastic films and sheets, and expanded polystyrene) from 2009 to\\n2017 in South Korea. We compared and analyzed the EPR systems of\\npackagingwasteintheselectedcountries intermsofthegenerationand\\nrecycling and recovery rates. Interviews with field experts, such as\\ngovernment officials and Korea Packaging Recycling Cooperative, andY.-C. Jang, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 158 (2020) 104798\\n2 the IEEP UK London branch were conducted to examine current efforts\\non new policy, operation status and limitations of the EPR systems in\\nEU. Statistical data such as national waste statistics published by the\\nKorea MOE, Japan and Eurostat in EU were analyzed to examine the\\ntrends of plastic packaging waste generation and recycling. Material\\nflow analysis was conducted to elucidate quantitative flow of plastic\\npackaging by life cycle (i.e., production, consumption, collection and\\nsorting and recycling and treatment, and disposal). Table 1presents the\\nsources of data and relevant references for the analysis.\\n2.2. GHG reduction potentials by recycling and source reduction\\nThe amounts of greenhouse gasses generated by incineration of\\npackaging waste and reduced by assuming it was recycled were cal-\\nculated by the US EPA WARM. The WARM is a tool that calculates the\\nGHG emissions, energy savings and economic impacts of baseline and\\nalternative waste management practices, including source reduction,\\nrecycling, combustion, composting, and anaerobic digestion and land-\\nfilling. GHG savings are calculated by comparing the emissions asso-\\nciated with managing materials under an alternative scenario with theemissions associated with a baseline scenario (i.e., current practices), as\\nopposed to multiplying the quantity of materials managed by emission\\nfactors (US EPA WARM). Not only recycling scenarios but also potential\\nfor reducing greenhouse gas emissions by source reduction scenarios\\nwere calculated for estimating the potential reduction and summarized\\nthe results. We also estimated economic profits from GHG gas reduction\\nby the scenarios based on market values in the emission trading scheme\\nin South Korea.\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Production and consumption of packaging waste\\nPlastic production has been increasing worldwide as it is applicable\\nto many industries as well as daily household goods due to its out-\\nstanding physical and chemical properties. A plastic manufacturing\\nindustry belongs to petrochemical industry, and petrochemical industry\\nthat produces synthetic resin, synthetic fiber raw material, synthetic\\nrubber and various basic chemical products from petroleum products or\\nnatural gas as raw materials. A domestic demand for plastics (or syn-\\nthetic resins) in South Korea is shown in Fig. 1. The domestic demand\\nhas been continually increased from 5.1 million in 2011 ton to 6.5\\nmillion ton in 2018 over the period. As of 2018, the most demanded\\nmaterial among the resins is PP, followed by PVC, LDPE and HDPE.\\nSuch synthetic resins are used for many industrial applications such\\nas packaging, building and construction, transportation, electronics and\\nelectrical equipment, household consumer products, and textiles. A\\ncomparison analysis of plastic consumption by industry type from the\\nworld, Japan and South Korea was conducted, as shown in Fig. 2. The\\nlargest consumption of plastics was found to be packaging applications.In Japan,more than 4 millionof plastic packaging andcontainers out ofapproximately 10 million ton (40.7%) were manufactured in 2017,\\nfollowed by electrical and electronics (1.9 million ton, 18.8%), auto-\\nmobiles (1.2 million ton, 12.1%), building and construction (1.19\\nmillion ton, 11.8%) in 2017 (Japan PWMI, 2019). In South Korea,\\nplastics were manufactured for packaging and containers (2.7 million\\nton, 46.5%), building and construction materials (1.4 million ton,\\n24.7%), automobiles (528,000 ton, 9.1%), and household consumer\\nproducts (461,000 ton, 7.9%), electrical and electronics (396,000 ton,\\n6.8%), and agricultural and fishery products (293,000 ton, 5.0%) (KEI,\\n2019).\\n3.2. Consumptions of single-use plastic packaging\\nPlastic raw materials are sold and consumed by consumers as plastic\\nproducts such as various packaging materials and containers. Much of\\nplastic packaging is made of single-use plastics. Europe has been ac-\\ntively responding to the problem of single-use plastics, including a\\nregulatory policy based on the 10 most plastic wastes found on beaches\\nin Europe (European Commission, 2019; UNEP, 2018). According to a\\nprevious study, plastic waste accounted for 82% of the total waste,\\nbased on the result of monitoring waste on beaches in South Korea.\\nPlastic packaging materials such as beverage bottles, snack bags, plastic\\nbags, and styrofoam containers have been commonly found on coastal\\nlines (Korea Marine Litter Information System, 2019).\\nIn this study, we collected basic data and estimated consumptions\\nfor four types of single-use plastics (PET drinking bottles, single- useplastic cups, single-use plastic bags, and single-use plastic containers\\nand cutlery for food delivery) that are commonly used in plastic\\npackaging materials in South Korea. For estimates of single-use plastic\\nconsumptions of selected four products, basic data such as consumption\\namounts, consumption frequency, the sales of products and the number\\nof food delivery in the country were collected. By using such data,\\nmaterial footprints of single-use plastics by the consumption for each\\nproduct were calculated. More detail data and calculation methods are\\navailable in Supplementary Materials (Table S1 through S4). Table 2\\nshows the material footprints of single-use plastics in South Korea. Asshown in Table 2, approximately 32.6 billion units of single-use plastics\\nwere consumed per year, 637.7 units with annual plastic consumption\\nper capita based on the four items. The single-use plastic consumption\\nper capita per year was 11.8 kg, resulting in 602,900 ton of single-use\\nplastic waste. It should be noted that the actual footprint may be much\\nhigher than the calculated footprint because other than the four items\\nin this study, many single-use plastics can be included such as plastic\\nstraws, colored PET bottles, carbonated beverage PET bottles, plastic\\nfilms, single-use razors and tooth brushes, and many others. As the\\nnumber of single-housing family is growing, the consumption of plastic\\npackaging materialsused forfood delivery maybe expected toincrease.Table 1\\nMethods for data collection and acquisition for material flow analysis of plastics in South Korea.\\nLife cycle Type of data References\\nExport/Import Export/Import of synthetic resin Korea Petrochemical Industry Association(KPIA), 2018\\nProduction Amount of synthetic resin production Korea Petrochemical Industry Association(KPIA), 2018\\nConsumption Amount of domestic demands for synthetic resin Korea Petrochemical Industry Association(KPIA), 2018\\nGeneration Amount of plastic waste Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE), 2018a\\nCollection and sorting Amount of collected waste by industrial type Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE), 2018a\\nRecycling & recovery Amount of material recycling (a) KEI, 2019\\nAmount of energy recovery (b) KEI, 2019\\nTotal incineration (c) Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE), 2018a\\nDisposal Incineration without energy recovery (d) (d) = (c)-(a)-(b)\\nAmount of incineration without energy recovery Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE), 2018a\\nAmount of landfill Korea Ministry of Environment(MOE), 2018aY.-C.

Generation and material flow of plastic packaging waste in South\\nKorea\\nPlastic waste generation in South Korea has been increased from 6\\nmillion tons in 2009 to about 8 million ton in 2017, as shown in\\nTable 3. The largest fraction of the plastic waste was industrial waste,\\nfollowed by household sector. The detailed types and characteristics of\\nplastic waste from the industry are unknown so far. Fig. 3shows the\\nmanagement flow of household waste streams in South Korea. Recycl-\\nables from households in South Korea are separated at source, typicallyconsisting of food waste, plastics, plastic vinyl bags, multi-layer films\\nand sheets, expanded polystyrene, glass bottles, metal and aluminum\\ncans, and papers. A lot of plastic waste is also found in waste disposable\\nbags that contained non-recyclables and are paid by households based\\non their weight, commonly known as pay-as-you-throw. The bags are\\ncollected at curbside or collection centers at multi-housing apartments\\nor complexes by local government and usually treated at incineration\\nfacilities and landfills. Some local municipalities process the disposal\\nbags by mechanical treatment (e.g., shredding, sorting and separation)\\nto recover material resources (e.g., refuse-derived fuels) before\\nFig. 1.Domestic demand of synthetic resin in South Korea from 2011 to 2018.\\nFig.2.(a) The World (UNEP, 2018), (b) Japan\\n(Japan PWMI, 2019), (c) South Korea (KEI,\\n2019).Figure 2 Plastic production rates by in-\\ndustry type (unit: 1000 ton): (a) The world(UNEP, 2018), (b) Japan (Japan PWMI, 2019),\\n(c) South Korea (KEI, 2019) followed by Figure\\n2 Plastic production rates by industry type\\n(unit: 1000 ton).Y.-C.

The generation of plastic\\nwaste was found to be approximately 8 million ton in 2017. The largest\\nfraction source was industrial waste (4.3 million ton), followed by\\ndisposal bags (1.7 million ton) and recyclables (1.3 million ton) from\\nhouseholds. Much of plastic waste in Korea was treated by energy re-\\ncovery followed by incineration without heat recovery and power\\ngeneration. Based on the analysis, the amount of energy recovery used\\nfor power generation using solid refuse fuel (SRF) or refuse-derived fuel\\n(RDF), auxiliary fuel in cement kiln and paper mill industry was 3216\\ntons. The material recycling rate of such waste was found to be 22.7%\\n(1.8 million ton), while the amount of plastic waste landfilled was 4.6%(approximately 365,000 ton).\\nIn 2017, approximately 19.5 million ton of all household waste was\\ngenerated with the largest fraction of disposal bags (9 million ton,\\n46%), followed by recyclables and food waste (5.3 million ton, 27% in\\neach). Out of the disposal bags and recyclables in the household waste,\\nplastic waste accounted for about 2.98 million tons (15%) out of total\\nhousehold waste streams (19.5 million ton) generated in Korea as of\\n2017 (Supplementary Materials Figure S1). Plastic wastes from house-\\nholds are mainly packaging materials (e.g., synthetic resin film and\\nsheet, plastic trays and containers, expanded polystyrene or styrofoam).\\nThe amount of source separated recyclable products was about 1.3\\nmillion ton, while 1.7 million ton of plastics was discharged by the\\ndisposal bags. Material flow of the plastic waste generated from\\nhousehold waste is shown in Fig. 5. The amount of incineration without\\nenergy recovery was the highest at 1.15 million tons (38.5%), followed\\nby the energy recovery with solid refuse fuel (SRF) (1.1 million tons,\\n37.5%) and material recycling (401,000 ton, 13.5%). The remaining\\nfraction (328, 000 ton, 11%) was disposed of landfills. Only 13.5% of\\nplastic waste from the household waste was recycled for resource re-\\ncovery in the economic sector.

The mandatory rates\\nby product on the EPR in 2019 typically range from 70% to 80.7% with\\nthe exceptions for polystyrene paper (PSP) (46.5%) and single/com-\\nposite materials of poly vinyl chloride (PVC) (30%). The detailed the\\ntarget rates and unit cost of contribution and can be found in\\nSupplementary Materials Table S5.\\nThe volume put on the market for target plastic packaging by the\\nEPR was approximately 897,000 ton in 2017. The volume put on the\\nmarket of plastic packaging managed by the EPR has been increased by\\nabout two-fold over the years. The recycling target of the mandatory\\nplastic packaging waste by the EPR accounted for about 670,000 ton in\\n2017. Among the target, approximately 837,000 ton of the waste was\\nactually collected recycled or recovered by thermal recycling, ex-\\nceeding the target amount by the EPR. For some products, the actual\\namounts recycled were higher than those put on the market because the\\ncumulative amounts from previous years and the recycling amounts\\nfrom the products that were not managed by the EPR might have been\\nincluded. The detailed amounts of put on the market, mandatory re-\\ncycling, and actual recycling for plastic packaging materials between2009 and 2017 by the EPR system can be found in Table 4.\\n3.5. Comparison of generation and recycling rates of plastic packagingwaste among selected countries\\nIn this study, South Korea's plastic packaging waste generation and\\ndisposal status was compared with five selected countries (Belgium,France, Germany, Japan, and UK). The generation and treatment status\\nof plastic packaging wastes between Korea and Japan is summarized in\\nTable 5. In Japan, total amount of waste from plastic packaging waste\\nwas about 4.2 million ton. Among the waste, 16.3% of plastic packa-\\nging waste was recycled for material recovery in 2017. In South Korea,\\nthe rate of material recycling was 13.5%, which is slightly lower than\\nJapan. Incineration with power generation in Japan accounted for\\n48.3% of power generation, 6.94% of refuse-derived fuel and cement\\nauxiliary fuel, and 5.26% of incineration with heat recovery. South\\nKorea represents 37.1% of incineration with energy recovery and\\n38.5% of incineration without energy recovery. In case of the land-\\nfilling, relatively lower rates of plastic packaging waste were found in\\nboth Korea (approximately 328,000 ton 11.0%) and Japan (approxi-\\nmately 170,000 ton, 4.1%).\\nFig. 7shows a comparison result of plastic packaging waste\\nFig. 6.The recycling system for packaging waste by EPR in South Korea.\\nTable 4\\nRecycling performance of plastic packaging waste by EPR in South Korea (Unit: 1000 ton).\\nSource:KORA, 2018.\\nCategory 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017\\nPET bottles Put on the market (Including import) 164 195 208 247 285\\nMandatory recycling amount 123 152 167 202 233\\nActual amount recycled 139 161 169 194 231\\nFoamed synthetic resin (EPS,PSP, exc.)

Japan, the largest producer of plastic packaging\\nwaste, generated about 4.2 million ton, followed by Germany, South\\nKorea, France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. However, when\\nconsidering the generation rate per capita, South Korea was the largest\\nwith 58.4 kg, followed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and\\nJapan, and Belgium.\\nFig. 8shows the recycling and recovery rates for plastic packaging\\nwastes among the countries. As shown in Fig. 8, the recovery rate of\\nplastic packaging waste in Germany and Belgium was close to 100%,while the recovery rates for Japan, France, UK, and South Korea were\\n82%, 70%, 60%, and 51%, respectively. Based on the results of material\\nrecycling rates, Germany was also the highest at 48%, followed by UK\\n(46.2%), Belgium (44.5%), France (26.5%), Japan (16%), and Korea\\n(13.5%). Comparing the results of South Korea's plastic packaging\\nwaste treatment methods with the selected countries, South Korea\\nshowed higher rates of landfilling and incineration without energy re-\\ncovery than those of the countries. It should be noted that although\\nplastic packaging waste generation per capita in South Korea is higher\\nthan the selected countries, its recovery rate and material recycling rate\\nare relatively lower.3.6. GHG reduction potentials by recycling and source reduction of plasticwaste\\nIncinerationofplastic wastecangenerategreenhousegasses(GHGs)\\ninto the air as well as potentially toxic gasses. Greenhouse gasses aregenerated in the production of plastic resins and processing into plastic\\nproducts, and even during product distribution and waste treatment\\n(European Commission, 2018). As plastic production has increased\\nsignificantly, greenhouse gasses from plastic production have also\\nsubstantially emitted in the air. In this study, the amount of greenhouse\\ngassesgeneratedby theincinerationofplastic wasteinSouthKoreawas\\ncalculated by using the US EPA WARM. In addition, the amount of\\ngreenhousegassesthatcanbereducedwascalculatedwhenthewasteis\\nassumed to be recycled instead of incinerated. Furthermore, the po-\\ntential for greenhouse gas reduction was estimated if source reduction\\nas an alternative scenario occurs. Based on the result in this study, it\\nwas estimated that as much as 3.6 million ton CO\\n2eq (carbon dioxide\\nequivalent) was generated from 2.7 million ton of plastic waste by in-\\ncineration in 2017 in South Korea. Assuming that it is entirely recycled,\\nit could reduce about 6.6 million ton of CO 2eq. Furthermore, if source\\nreduction is practiced instead of recycling, GHGs can be reduced atabout 9.2 million ton of CO\\n2eq, which is 1.4 times higher than the\\namount of the reduction by the recycling scenario.\\nIn South Korea, GHG emission trading system has been im-\\nplemented in the beginning of 2015 by the Act on the Allocation andTrading of GHG Emission Permits, which was first enacted in May 14,\\n2012. According to the Korea Exchange Emissions Market Price\\nInformation, one ton of CO\\n2was traded at about USD 26 in 2018 (or\\nKorean Won 30,000). By using the price on the market, the economicbenefits from the GHG reduction by the recycling are estimated to be\\napproximately 169 million USD or about 198 billion Korean won per\\nyear. In the case of the source reduction, the potential benefit was es-\\ntimated to be about 235 million USD or about 276 billion Korean won\\nper year.\\n3.7.

Jang, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 158 (2020) 104798\\n8 plastics to be disposed of. Significant concerns have been raised due to\\ntheir leakage to oceans polluting marine environment as well as\\ngreenhouse gas impact of plastics production and treatment. Marine\\nlitters recently found in Korean costal lines consisted of more than 80%\\nof plastic waste, according to the monitoring report of marine debris\\n(Korea Marine Environmental Management Corporation, 2019). The\\nglobal awareness of the serious plastic pollution has led to a surge in\\ncountries that have introduced policies to regulate the use of plastic\\npackaging materials. Europe announced in `strategy for plastics in a\\ncircular economy '' in 2018 to regulate plastic waste. Highlights include\\nthe ban on the use of single-use plastics such as straws, swabs, balloons\\nand plates by 2021, 90% recovery of single-use plastic beverage bottlesby 2025, changes to all reusable plastic packaging by 2030 and re-\\ncycling plastic waste more than half of amount that consumed in\\nEurope (European Commission 2018). In addition, Europe introduced a\\nsingle-use plastic management strategy to define 10 single-use plastic\\nproducts and prepared management strategies such as banning market\\nrelease, reducing usage, labeling, and increasing producer responsi-\\nbility (European Commission, 2019).\\nBased on the result of this study, the generation of the plastic\\npackaging waste per capita in South Korea is relatively at high levels\\ncompared with those of other countries, while the rates of the material\\nrecycling and energy recovery in the country are at lower levels than\\nother countries. Although the recycling of the waste is a preferred op-\\ntion to landfills and incineration, reducing the production and con-\\nsumption of plastic packaging could result in substantially economic\\nbenefits as well as far less environmental burdens. Thus, more\\nstrengthened regulations on the production and consumption of plastic\\npackaging materials should be developed to deal with the issues, in-\\ncluding the bans or restricted use of single-use plastic packaging (e.g.,\\nplastic bags, plastic cups and straws, plastic cutlery, foamed plastics by\\nfood delivery), design changes for recycling, and labeling. Currently,\\nthere are no definitions and scope of single-use plastics in the reg-\\nulatory system in South Korea. Strengthened measures aimed at dealing\\nwith the problems related to the single-use plastics can be made in-\\ncluding a target on the reduction of the consumption, marine litter\\nprevention in the waste management, and recycling and recovery of the\\nwaste. As an example of plastic waste reduction efforts, ‘waste mart’where plastic recyclables are exchanged with goods was recently\\nopened to solve plastic packaging waste problems in Seoul. Cash or\\npoints are given to participants when used PET bottles are introduced\\ninto a bottle collector machine with artificial intelligence. The points\\ncan be used for purchasing upcycled products such as bags made from\\nused fire fighters’ clothing's and biodegradable products.\\nIn 2018, The Korea MOE developed the 'Comprehensive Measures\\nfor Plastic Waste Recycling Management' to reduce plastic waste gen-\\neration by 50% by 2030 and increase the recycling and recovery rate to\\n70% by 2030. Several measures include voluntary agreement on pro-\\nhibiting the use of disposable cups within cafeteria, the changes of all\\nPET water and drink bottles to colorless by 2020, the evaluation of therecyclability of packaging materials, the regulation on the easy de-\\ntachment of plastic packaging labeling, the strengthened EPR system by\\nexpanding the number of target products from 43 to 63 by 2022, and\\nthe expansion of green procurement in public sectors. From January 1,\\n2020, films of synthetic resins contained air-filled films used to create\\nbuffer packaging or insulation effects, plastic packaging films used to\\nprotect clothing after dry cleaning in commercial laundry, single-use\\nplastic bags, single-use vinyl gloves, and wrapping films for food\\npackaging would be included in the list of the mandatory recycling for\\npackaging waste by the EPR. Recently, South Korea is also operating a\\nstrengthened system to curb the use of single-use plastics, (e.g., a ban\\non the use of single-use plastic by free of charge in restaurants, cafe-\\nteria,andbakery,and abanontheuse ofsingle-useplasticbags atlarge\\nand medium-sized supermarkets of an area of 165 m\\n2). More specific\\nimplementation strategies and setting priorities of plastic packagingwaste are still needed for transforming current linear economy into a\\ncircular economy.\\nThe material flow analysis shows that in 2017, the recycling rate of\\nentire plastic waste streams was 22.7% in South Korea, while energy\\nrecovery by using solid refuse fuel and heat recovery and incineration\\nwithout energy recovery represented 39.3% and 33.4%, respectively. In\\ncase of household waste, the material recycling rate of plastic waste in\\nKorea was calculated to be only 13%, which is considerably lower than\\nother countries. The reasons for the low recycling rate include low\\nquality of mixed plastic wastes (mixing with diverse plastic resins or\\ncomposite materials), low benefits from economies of scale in sorting\\nFig. 8.Recovery and material recycling rate of plastic packaging waste from household waste.\\n(Source: Eurostat, 2019)Y.-C. Jang, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 158 (2020) 104798\\n9 and recycling, additives used in plastic packaging, and limited demands\\nfor recycled products. In addition, the recycling of packaging waste by\\nthe current EPR system in South Korea is highly dependent on the\\ncontributions paid by the producers, relying upon rudimentary sorting\\nand separation methods along with labor intensive works. Although the\\npackaging waste recycling industry has been nurtured by the recycling\\nsubsidies and by the private investment since the introduction of the\\nEPR system in 2003, it is still fragmented under poor working en-\\nvironment with low quality of the recycled products on the markets. As\\nthe recycling plants are relatively small, they are vulnerable in re-\\nsponding to fluctuations in the domestic and overseas recycling market.\\nTherefore, there is an urgent need to keep fostering the recycling in-\\ndustry by developing and innovating plastic waste recycling technolo-\\ngies with modern methods, restructuring and expanding investment in\\nthe recycling industry. Green infrastructure and circular economic\\nmodel by resource recovery should be developed and established to\\nimprove current packaging waste management.\\n4. Conclusions\\nManagement of plastic packaging waste has become an issue of\\nconcern in environmental community due to potential hazards to eco-\\nsystems in oceans and rivers and streams by leakage through existing\\nwaste collection systems. Significant amounts of plastic packaging\\nmaterials such as drinking water plastic bottles, plastic bags and cups,\\nand plastic food containers are commonly found in the ecosystems,\\nalthough active collection and recycling efforts on such waste has been\\ncommonly made to recover recyclable components in waste streams by\\nextended producer responsibility (EPR) in many developed countries. It\\nis important to effectively collect and properly treat plastic packaging\\nwaste from households from the view of pollution prevention that\\notherwise may result in serious human health problems and the en-\\nvironmental impacts by improper management. This study examines\\ncurrent recycling practices and recycling rates of such waste. Based on\\nthe result of MFA, approximately 3 million tons of the waste was gen-\\nerated from households in South Korea and treated by energy recovery\\nwith solid refuse fuels and heat (39.3%), incineration without heat and\\nenergy recovery(33.4%), and material recycling(13%) in 2017. It was\\nalso found that more than 32 billion of single use plastics in selected\\nfour items (drinking water plastic bottles, plastic cups, plastic bags, and\\ndisposable plastics by food delivery)were annually consumed, resulting\\nin about 600,000 tons of plastic waste for disposal. By converting to\\nfootprint of single-use plastic consumption per capita, this is equivalent\\nto 638 plastics per capita or equivalent to approximately 11.8 kg per\\ncapita in South Korea. A small fraction (22.3%) of plastic packaging\\nwaste is managed by the EPR. Consequently, more stringent regulations\\nby expanding a list of target recycling items (e.g., plastic air bubbles,\\nplastic packaging for fruits, PET containers) in the current EPR system\\nare needed to better manage the waste and prevent plastic pollution in\\nthe environment upon disposal. Based on the US EPA WARM model,\\ngreenhouse gas emission can be reduced to approximately 6.6 million\\nton of CO 2eq when the recycling is implemented for the packaging\\nwaste that is currently incinerated. As a result of comparative analysisbetween Korea, Japan and EU countries, Germany, Belgium, and UK\\nhave achieved relatively high recycling and recovery rates of the waste.\\nCost-effective and advanced recycling technology with innovations is\\nurgently needed for environmentally sound management of plastic\\npackaging waste towards a circular economy to reduce GHG emission\\nas well as potential leakage into the ecosystems.\\nCredit author statement\\nAll of the authors listed in the manuscript entitled, “Recycling and\\nManagement Practices of Plastic Packaging Waste towards a Circular\\nEconomy in South Korea”, worked jointly together and individually in\\nseveral sections during the preparation of manuscript and researchproject supported by the Korea Ministry of the Environment.\\ndr..Yong-ChulJang,firstand correspondingauthor, developedthe\\ntheoretical formalism, performed the material flow analysis and cal-culations.

First, the \\nmanufacture  of resin from post-consume  EPS containers  was demonstrated  possible  by the manufacturer.  \\nSecond,  results show that using 30% of post-consume  resin in the mix produce  satisfactory  laboratory  \\nresults and operational  recycled  containers.  \\n©2 0 2 0 The Author(s).

Introduction  \\nAs the Ecuadorian  society  grows in population  and economy,  \\nits needs increases,  thus rising waste generation.  An increasingly  \\nstream  of wastage  being dispose  in landﬁlls  has quickly  become  \\na signiﬁcant  problem  for the country  ( Tekler et al., 2019 ). Accord-  \\ning to the National  Institute  of Statistics  and Censuses  (INEC) in \\n2016, almost 13 thousand  tons of solid waste were collected  daily, \\nof which 90.3% were collected  in an unsorted  manner  and 9.7% \\nin a sorted manner  ( National  Institute  of Statistics  and Censuses,  \\nSolid Residues  Management,  2016 ). Also, the increasing  extraction  \\nof natural  resources  to support  economic  growth  has made an im- \\npact on the environmental  and social sustainability  of the supply \\nnetworks  ( Koumparou,  2017 , Sitepu et al., 2016 ). The scarcity  of \\nresources  will increase  in the future and the ability to recover  and \\n∗Corresponding  author at: ESPOL Polytechnic  University,  Escuela Superior  \\nPolitécnica  del Litoral, ESPOL, Facultad de Ingeniería  Mecánica  y Ciencias de la Pro- \\nducción, Campus Gustavo Galindo Km. 30.5 Vía Perimetral,  P.O.

Amaya). manage  these resources  will become  essential  for a sustainable  lo- \\ncal economy  ( Vea et al., 2018 ). \\nIn previous  research  ( Hidalgo  et al., 2019 ), the authors  classi- \\nﬁed and measured  the amounts  of waste produced  per household  \\nin the city of Guayaquil.  A total of 0.61 kg is generated  per person  \\ndaily, from which almost 76% is organic,  8% plastic,  6% paper and \\ncardboard,  6% for glass and dust and 4% of metal and others. Con- \\nsidering  a total of 2.291 million  people for the city in the year 2010 \\n( National  Institute  of Statistics  and Censuses,  Solid Residues  Man- \\nagement,  2010 ), according  to the last Census  performed  by INEC, \\nalmost 1780 tons of solid waste is generated  every day. This rep- \\nresents  approximately  41% of the total waste collected  by the mu- \\nnicipality.  \\nPlastic waste has been put under scrutiny;  due to, its genera-  \\ntion has been constantly  increasing  over the last decades.  Nowa- \\ndays, the production  of plastic reached  about 350 million  tons per \\nyear worldwide  ( Heidbreder  and Bablok,  2019 ). There is growing  \\nevidence  that the current  use and disposal  of plastic leads to sub- \\nstantial  pollution  of terrestrial  and aquatic  ecosystems,  having a \\ntremendous  effect on various  aspects  including  wildlife,  through  \\ndiverse  routes. These impacts  are especially  noticeable  for single- \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2020.01.089  \\n2212-8271/© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, polystyrene  is very \\nstable and extremely  hard to degrade  in the environment  after dis- \\nposal ( Ho et al., 2018 ). One study on life cycle analysis  concludes  \\nthat to produce  1.716 g of EPS, 87.47 mg of CO 2 are released  in the \\natmosphere  ( Tan and Khoo, 2005 , Leejarkpai  et al., 2016 ). \\nThe city hall of Guayaquil,  aims to regulate  the manufacture,  \\ntrade (of any type), distribution  and delivery  of single-use  plastics.  \\nWithin  this ordinance,  the manufacturers  of single-use  EPS items \\nmust change  the formula  in their process,  to a new formula  or \\nproduct  agreeing  with any of the following  options:  1) products  are \\n100% biodegradable,  2) 70% of total product  mass comes from recy- \\ncled materials  and 3) using other reusable  materials  in the lapse of \\n30 months  ( Ecuador.  Autonomous  Decentralized  Government  Mu- \\nnicipality  of Guayaquil,  2018 ). In concordance  with the local ordi- \\nnance are international  regulations  that the country  needs to ac- \\ncomplish.  For example,  in July 2019, the Associated  States of the \\nPaciﬁc Alliance,  from which Ecuador  is a new member,  referred  to \\nthe importance  of developing  new policies  to promote  the integral  \\nmanagement  of waste and reducing  the production  of single-use  \\nplastics  ( Ecuador.  Autonomous  Decentralized  Government  Munici-  \\npality of Guayaquil,  2019 ). \\nImportantly,  Guayaquil  is the city with highest  plastic manufac-  \\nturing, according  to the Ecuadorian  Plastic Associantion  (ASEPLAS),  \\n64% of the 600 companies  nationwide  are localted  in this impor- \\ntant and this single industry  generates  more than 19,0 0 0 direct \\nand 120,0 0 0 indirect  jobs ( Magazine,  20 08 ). Furthermore,  nation-  \\nwide EPS container  manufacturers  do not comply  with any of the \\nthree choices  the city hall ordinance  has set as acceptable.  This is \\nthe main reason why EPS item producer  ´s opinion  is that the local \\nordinance  could harm the industry  in its production  processes  and \\nrisk the stability  of many workers.  \\nThus, the following  question  arises: what strategy  should plastic \\nmanufacturing  companies  follow to survive  in this new local eco- \\nfriendly  environment?  \\nOne contributing  solution  is shifting  from a linear economy  to \\na circular  economy  in single-use  items production  by means of \\nreusing  and recycling  expanded  polystyrene  products.  Manufactur-  \\ners already  reuse their scrap as part of their production  process  \\n(between  30 to 40%), so if they add post-consume  resin as raw ma- \\nterial, they could achieve  the 70% recycled  material  objective  set by \\nthe municipality.  \\nThis study focuses  in giving feasible  options  to the single-use  \\nplastic manufacturers  to redesign  their products,  so they can in- \\ncrease the use of recycled  (post-consume)  material;  applying  the \\nconcept  of circular  economy  to strengthen  their competitiveness  \\nand supporting  resource  sustainability.  \\nFor this purpose,  the linear typical economy  and circular  econ- \\nomy proposal  set by the authors  are presented  in the methodology  \\n( Section  2 ). The process  description  to obtain the recycled  resin \\nfrom post-consume  containers  effectuated  by the manufacturer  is \\nthen presented.  Production  of new recycled  containers  and labo- \\nratory test values are presented  in the results ( Section  3 ). Finally,  \\nconclusions  and discussion  are presented  in Sectons  4 and 5 . \\n2. Methodology  \\nThe prevailing  linear economic  system  in local plastic manufac-  \\nturers accumulates  waste, while depleting  natural  resources.  Limi- \\ntations  of natural  resources  and a growing  world population  have \\nset the idea of a circular  economy  in the focus of research,  industry  \\nand politics  in recent years ( Spierling  et al., 2018 ). Fig. 1. Linear economy  EPS cycle. \\n2.1. Linear economy  EPS production  cycle \\nPlastic is present  everywhere,  every day; either as a raw ma- \\nterial or as ﬁnished  product.  As a result, plastic is a continuous  \\ngrowing  industry.  Indeed,  its sales has reﬂected  a steady growth  of \\nabout 9% in the period from 2014 to 2018 ( Mativenga  et al., 2017 ). \\nThis industry  has made rapid progress,  since plastic is an element  \\nused in different  sectors.  In addition  to being the main raw mate- \\nrial, it is a product  on which many other processes  depend.  It is \\nestimated  that between  70 to 80% of necessary  plastic is supplied  \\nby local industries  ( Magazine,  2008 ), only importing  highly spe- \\ncialized  plastic products  or in large volumes.  Nevertheless,  most \\nresidues  end up in landﬁlls,  culminating  a linear economy  and af- \\nfecting  the environment.  Fig. 1 shows the current  linear economy  \\nto manufacture  EPS products  in the country.  Next, each of the steps \\npresented  in the scheme  of EPS lineal economy  cycle will be ex- \\nplained  in detail. \\n2.1.1. Raw material  \\nAccording  to ASEPLAS,  the import  of plastic resins reached  381 \\nthousand  tons in 2017 ( Magazine,  2008 ). Plastic companies  acquire  \\nalmost all its raw material  from abroad,  because  there is no local \\npetrochemical  industry  that can produce  in large volumes  to meet \\nthe demand  of national  industries.  Futrthermore,  plastic companies  \\nin Ecuador  make no-effort  s to obt ain raw materials  from recycling  \\nof EPS waste and don ´t attempt  to ﬁnd alternative  materials,  given \\nthat EPS is very ingrained  in the culture  of society.  \\n2.1.2. EPS product  manufacture  and Scrap reuse/reprocess  \\nIn an attempt,  to reduce the use of “virgin resin” residues  from \\nthe manufacturing  process  are collected  (scrap)  for reuse. For this \\npurpose,  the raw material  in the form of a mix of “virgin” and  \\n“scrap” resin  pellets,  enters the manufacture  process  to obtain ex- \\npanded  polystyrene  products,  such as: dishes,  plates, drink con- \\ntainers.  Also, residues  from this process  are collected  in the form \\nof scrap for later treatment  and reuse. The latter tries to avoid \\nresidues  within the boundaries  of the company.   J. Hidalgo-Crespo,  F.X. Jervis and C.M. Moreira et al. / Procedia CIRP 90 (2020) 49–54 51 \\nFig. 2. Proposed  circular economy  cycle \\n2.1.3. Distribution  \\nThe EPS products  are transported  to intermediary  businesses  \\nsuch as: fast food companies,  grocery  stores, restaurants,  resellers  \\nand many others that will deliver  the products  to the ﬁnal users. \\n2.1.4. Final use \\nThe ﬁnal user for this cycle is the household  owner that ac- \\nquires these products  and then throws  it away as waste, usually  \\nwithout  sorting  it ﬁrst as written  in the previous  section.  \\n2.1.5. Landﬁll  \\nAccording  to the Ministry  of Environment  (MAE), nowadays  49% \\nof the municipalities  dispose  of their waste in landﬁlls  and emerg-  \\ning cells. The rest still dispose  the ﬁnal waste in open-air  dumps,  \\nwhich generates  direct effects on the soil, landscape,  air, health \\nand water. EPS waste takes as much as 500 years to degrade  with- \\nout oxygen,  but the expiration  time of landﬁlls  is not as long. \\n2.2. Proposed  circular  economy  EPS production  cycle \\nIn a circular  economy,  resources  are kept in use for as long \\nas possible,  extracting  the maximum  value from them whilst in \\nuse, then recovering  and regenerating  products  and materials  at \\nthe end of each service  life ( Cabello,  2014 ). The circular  economy  \\nconcept  provides  a key opportunity  to address  the challenge  of re- \\nsource scarcity  for both policy makers  and industries.  Companies  \\nare urged to play their part and integrate  circular  economy  in their \\nbusiness  ( Stewart  et al., 2018 , Biganzoli  et al., 2018 ). \\nNowadays,  single-use  expanded  polystyrene  manufacturing  \\ncompanies  in Ecuador  don ´t recycle  post-consumption  plastic for \\ntheir production  process.  In fact, they reprocess  the scrap mate- \\nrial left from the molding  and cutting  of the plastic products  and \\nother forms to process  post-industrial  resin, applying  the reuse of \\nthe 3R ´s of circular  economy  inside the boundaries  of the company.  \\nAfter, the post-industrial  and virgin resin are mixed to create new \\nEPS products.  However,  this doesn ´t mean that less EPS waste is \\nbeing buried in local landﬁlls.  As shown in the previous  section,  almost 92% of all waste is buried and between  6 to 8% is recycled.  \\nFig. 2 shows the proposed  circular  economy  model for EPS waste \\nin dashed  red lines. The landﬁll  is removed  in this model by at- \\ntempting  to reprocess  the post-consume  waste. \\n2.2.1. Individual  collection  \\nIn the current  way to recycle  waste, household  owners  leave \\ntheir waste bags outside  their homes in the set garbage  truck \\nschedule.  Afterwards,  individual  collectors  check the waste and \\nseparate  all that they think has value. In order to recycle  EPS \\nwaste, ﬁrst household  owners  must be conscientized  on the sep- \\naration  of their residues  inside their homes.  \\nSecondly,  monetary  value must be given to EPS residues  by \\nwaste recycle  companies  and/or resellers  to make individual  col- \\nlectors also take that type of waste. \\n2.2.2. EPS waste resellers  \\nThe waste is after taken for storage  and reselling.  Such busi- \\nnesses already  exist and operate  in the city, so EPS waste must be \\nadded to their structure.  \\n2.2.3. Waste reprocesses  \\nThe collected  EPS must be retransformed  in resin pellets to be \\nused in the manufacture  of new products.  This process  may be \\ndone by the plastic manufacturer  or by a third party if it is eco- \\nnomically  attractive.  Further  information  of this process  can be \\nseen in Section  3.1 . \\n3. Results  \\nIn order to achieve  this proposed  circular  economy  scenario,  \\nproblems  and constraints  must be alleviated  ﬁrst. One of them \\nis precise  data on the possibility  of obtaining  high quality  EPS \\nproducts  using recycled  post-consume  products  combined  with the \\nused “scrap” and  “virgin” resin  for the manufacturing  process.  In \\nthis context,  from June to August  2019, the authors  collaborated   52 J. Hidalgo-Crespo,  F.X. Jervis and C.M. Moreira et al. / Procedia CIRP 90 (2020) 49–54 \\nFig. 3. Post-Consume  EPS resin transformation  process \\nwith a local plastic manufacturer  in order to formalize  the recy- \\ncling of single-use  expanded  polystyrene  post-consume  containers.  \\nThe goal was to obtain at least 100 kg of the post-consume  recy- \\ncled EPS. \\nFor this purpose,  one hundred  volunteer  students  from two lo- \\ncal universities  participated  in the collection  process,  and a total \\namount  of 230 kg was collected.  After collection,  the manufacturer  \\ncontinued  with the protocol  agreed for the post-consume  recycling  \\nprocess  at their quarters.  The experiment  formalization  includes  all \\nthe process  starting  from the arrival of post-consume  EPS waste \\nwhere the authors  helped  with the collection  through  the produc-  \\ntion of recycled  resin and subsequent  elaboration  of new EPS con- \\ntainers.  \\n3.1. Manufacturing  of waste recycle resin pellets \\nFig. 3 shows the recycling  process  of the post-consume  plas- \\ntic waste until it becomes  resin pellets done by the manufactur-  \\ning company.  The ﬁrst 4 steps were done in an artisanal  manner  \\nby just one operator.  It started  with the 1. prewashing  of all waste \\nusing a hose with pressurized  water to remove  any remains  of or- \\nganic matter impregnated  to the waste. Continued  with the 2. se- \\nlection/segregation  of the waste, where the operator  proceeded  to \\ndivide the waste between  the colors of presentation  and excluding  \\nany material  that could not continue  the process.  \\nAfter came the 3. washing  in a washing-machine  where liquid \\ndetergent,  degreaser  and liquid chlorine  were added and after 4. \\ndrying at medium  temperature.  This process  lasted around  45 min \\n(25 min washing  + 20 min drying)  per cycle and even though  the \\nmaximum  capacity  of the washing-machine  and dryer is 20 kg, \\nonly 600 g approximately  could be introduced  inside the machines  \\nduring each batch, because  of the high volume  (low density)  of \\nthe waste. The washing  and drying of enough  material  took ap- \\nproximately  2 weeks to obtain almost 14 kg of dry waste. After, it \\nFig. 4. Manufacturing  of post-consume  extruded  sheet \\nwas transported  to the reprocess  area where the company  trans- \\nforms the scrap into resin as previously  stated. There, the waste \\nfollowed  three more steps: 5. grinding,  6. extrusion  and 7. pelletiz-  \\ning where waste was crushed  into small fragments  and granules  in \\nthe grinder,  then passed to the extruder  through  heat and pressure  \\nuntil it dissolved  and ﬁnally ﬂew out of a small outlet and solid- \\niﬁed into a continuous  thin line. The extruded  plastic stream  was \\nthen cut into pellets by a pellet cutter with a rotation  knife and \\ncooled in a water bath at room temperature.  \\n3.2. Manufacturing  of post-consume  new EPS containers  \\nBefore the test, the company  used 70% of virgin resin and 30% \\nof scrap reprocessed/reused  resin for their process.  Depending  on \\nthe type of container  built, they programmed  the sheet extrusion  \\nmachine  for certain  thickness  of the sheet. \\nFor the experiment,  the manufacturer  decided  to combine  all \\nthree types of resin before entering  the EPS sheet extrusion  line \\nusing the following  mix as shown in Fig. 4: \\n• 40% Virgin Resin (18.0 kg) \\n• 30% Scrap Reprocess  Resin/Reuse  (13.5 kg) \\n• 30% Recycled  Post-Consume  Resin (13.5 kg) \\nThe machine  was already  in operation  with a previous  batch \\nwhen they entered  the mix and set to produce  2.2 mm plates. So, \\nthe ﬁrst two rolls (see Fig. 4 ) were marked  as transition,  since they \\ncontained  the previous  and new mix and the following  two were \\nmarked  as post-consume.  \\nTotal weight  of transition  rolls were 43.6 kg and the weight  \\nof the post-consume  rolls were 21.6 kg, giving a ﬁnal weight  of \\n65.2 kg. The transition  roll occurred  when shifting  from the usual \\nmix to the new proposed  mix, therefore  there were 20.2 kg of ex- \\ntra EPS sheet. After this, the four rolls were separated  and storage  \\nfor further  use in a next session,  given that all thermo  forming  \\nmachines  were busy at the time of the experiment,  as shown in \\nFig. 4 . \\nOne week after the sheet rolls of expanded  polystyrene  were \\nmade, the manufacturer  decided  to make 5 in. x 5 in. foam food \\ncontainers  as the trial run of the new process  using the recycling  \\nresin. They set the post-consume  rolls in the machine  and started  \\nrunning  it. Some post-consume  containers  were taken away for \\nlaboratory  analysis  with other previous  ones in order to compare  \\nproperties.   J. Hidalgo-Crespo,  F.X. Jervis and C.M.

Laboratory  analysis  tests \\nBased on the previous  sections,  ﬁve samples  of each of the \\nthree type of ﬁnal products  were collected  for posterior  analysis:  \\nA Regular  mix EPS containers.  \\nB Reformulated  mix EPS containers  transition  roll. \\nC Reformulated  mix EPS containers  post-consume  roll. \\nAll samples  were weighed,  and their resistance  measured  after \\n24 hours. Average  values are shown in Table 1 . We consider  the A \\ncontainers  as the base sample.  The presence  of recycled  materials  \\nseems to make the mixture  more rigid ( Barrera  Castro ) in the tran- \\nsition sample.  However,  the analysis  for the transition  was made \\nonly 2 hours after production,  in a previous  day, so that may be \\nthe reason for the difference.  \\nAlso, microbiological  analysis  is necessary  for these products  \\nto ensure quality  through  the application  of procedures  to test \\nthe presence  of microorganisms  and compare  them to standard-  \\nized limits ( Mirzaei  et al., 2016 ). This becomes  very important  in \\nthe context  of a circular  economy,  since microorganisms  present  in \\nfood industry  as a microﬂora  may penetrate  EPS waste food con- \\ntainers.  The reprocess  of new recycled  resin pellets could lead to \\nundesirable  effects on public health.  \\nNonetheless,  laboratory  analysis  effectuated  by the manufac-  \\nturer showed  no presence  of microorganisms  in any of the sam- \\nples. This can be explained  because  the extrusion  process  occurs \\nat a temperature  higher than 200 °C for the recycled  resin manu- \\nfacture  and almost 120 °C for the roll production.  Both processes  \\nadd almost 18 min of total time and at these temperatures,  no mi- \\ncroorganisms  can survive.  \\nFinally,  containers  or other expanded  polystyrene  elements  can \\nrelease  particles  that can be absorbed  by food. The certiﬁcation  \\nof these products  is done by the migration  test. Plastic materials  \\nand objects  should not yield their components  to food products  in \\nquantities  exceeding  10 mg/dm  2 or 60 mg/kg (limit of Global Mi- \\ngration  by Ecuadorian  Technical  Standard  NTE INEN-EN  1186-1).  \\nFor this experiment,  migration  test results,  although  being a lit- \\ntle higher for recycled  containers,  still showed  much lower levels \\nthan the limits set by the Ecuadorian  Technical  Standard  ( Table 2 ). \\n4. Conclusions  and ﬁnal remarks  \\nBased on the literature  and the country  ´s actual recycle  scheme;  \\na circular  economy  model scenario  has been proposed.  Unarguably,  \\nthe beneﬁts  derived  from the implementation  of circular  economy  \\nare due to the reduction  in the consumption  of natural  resources.  \\nHowever,  the economic  and environmental  beneﬁts  are not self- evident  and need to be proven  by an in-depth  analysis  such as life \\ncycle assessment  of the current  and proposed  scenarios.  \\nThe primary  aim of this research  was to contribute  to the pri- \\nvate single-use  plastic industry  to redesign  their products  using \\nrecycled  materials.  To attain this purpose,  it was made clear that \\nEPS waste reprocess  to form new resin pellets is possible  and that \\nmixing  with virgin and reused pellets can create high quality  new \\nproducts.  \\nThere is a great plastic waste problem,  and it is an issue that \\nmust be considered.  Most post-consume  EPS containers  are dis- \\ncarded in landﬁlls  and pollute  the environment.  The rates of waste \\nrecovery  in Ecuador  are very low, so it is of vital importance  for \\npolicy making  institutions  to increase  the knowledge  of circular  \\neconomy  and help them asses the feasibility  of recycling  EPS and \\ndevelop  a supportive  system  that facilitates  and encourages  recy- \\ncling activities  among  recyclable  waste collectors’  associations.  \\n5. Discussion  and future research  \\nThe plastic companies  in the country  reuse/reprocess  the scrap \\nleft from the production  lines. This prevents  the scrap to end-up  \\nin landﬁlls  and damage  environment.  Nevertheless,  the reprocess  \\nmeans more energy  is needed  to recover  material  through  post- \\nindustrial  pellets.  Thus, more analysis  is needed  to evaluate  the to- \\ntal damage  done to the environment  between  the two choices  by \\nlife cycle assessment,  which is a systematic  analysis  of the envi- \\nronmental  impact  of products  during their entire life cycle (pro- \\nduction,  use and disposal  phases).  \\nThis ﬁrst attempt  to demonstrate  the mechanical  recyclability  \\nof EPS single use products,  in Ecuador,  proves the potential  for the \\ndevelopment  of a circular  economy  around  this type of waste ma- \\nterial. However,  more trials are need to be set in place to diminish  \\nthe difference  in values for weight  and resistance.  In practice,  un- \\nfortunately,  remelting  and forming  new post-consume  resin often \\ndegrades  the properties  of the recycled  items products.  Thus, the \\namount  of virgin resin shall increase  to keep the quality  of the ﬁ- \\nnal product  and some waste will always be created.  \\nAlso, in order to develop  a circular  economy  around  domes-  \\ntic waste, people need to participate  in the process  of separa-  \\ntion. Studies  indicate  that when made available  people will use \\nthe colored  recycle  bins. Government  intervention  is important,  \\nto surveillance  and reinforcement  of already  made policies,  for \\nmanaging  possible  recycling  items. Also, reprocess  companies  must \\nhave the technology  to decontaminate  the polymers  before melting  \\nand resell high quality  recycled  plastic raw material  to the manu- \\nfacturers.  \\nAcknowledgements  \\nThe authors  would like to thank Marco Roche, Eng.; Technical  \\nManager  of Plásticos  del Litoral S.A.

Introduction\\nWhilst there is a signi ﬁcant body of research into the manage-\\nment of household waste there is surprisingly limited research into\\nthe management of commercial and industrial waste (hereafter\\nreferred to as C &I or business waste) both in England and world-\\nwide. The de ﬁnition of C &I waste in England is set out in section 75\\nof the Environmental Protection Act 1990 ( Great Britain, 1990 ) and\\nis all waste generated by commerce and industry. Table 1 provides a\\nsummary of the C &I waste de ﬁnition and a breakdown of waste\\narisings. Whilst England has the Waste Data Flow system which\\nrequires local authorities to return data to government on the\\nquantities and management of household waste, no such system\\nexists for C &I waste leading to uncertainties in arisings and data\\ngaps. Improving the quality of C &I data has been identi ﬁed a pri-\\nority by the government ( Department for Environment, Food andRural Affairs, 2018 ). The latest government estimate is that 37.9\\nmillion tonnes of C &I was waste generated in 2017 far exceeding\\nthe 22.4 million tonnes produced from households ( Department for\\nEnvironment, 2019 ).\\nWhilst establishing effective systems for managing C &I waste is\\npivotal in our attempts to meet the principles of a Circular Econ-\\nomy, the waste stream has historically been overlooked in both\\nnational and European waste policy. This was acknowledged in the\\ngovernment ’s 2011 Review of Waste Policy where the government\\nstated it would be taking steps to improve the waste and recycling\\nservices to businesses, especially Small and Medium Enterprises\\n(hereafter referred to as SMEs) ( Department for Environment, Food\\nand Rural Affairs, 2011a ). This commitment to support SMEs was\\nreinforced in the government ’s most recent strategy ‘Our Waste,\\nOur Resources ’published in 2018 ( Department for Environment,\\nFood and Rural Affairs, 2018 ).\\nThe European Commission de ﬁnes SMEs as businesses with less\\nthan 250 employees or have a turnover of less than V50 million (see\\nTable 2 ). Globally SMEs represent 90% of businesses and more than E-mail address: rw95@brighton.ac.uk .\\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\\nJournal of Cleaner Production\\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jclepro\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123770\\n0959-6526/ ©2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Across the Organisation\\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2019)\\nalmost one person out of three is employed in a micro ﬁrm with less\\nthan 10 employees, and two out of three in an SME. In many\\ncountries SMEs contribute more than 50% of GDP ( International\\nLabour Organization, 2020 ). At the start of 2018 SMEs accounted\\nfor 99.9% of all private sector businesses, 59.2% of private sector\\nemployment and 51.0% of private sector turnover in England(Department for Business, Energy &Industrial Strategy and Of ﬁce\\nfor National Statistics (2018) . As such SMEs have a vital role to\\nplay in the economy, employment, environmental protection and\\nresource ﬂows.\\nThe most recent data providing a breakdown on the levels of\\nC&I waste based on businesses size was published in 2011\\n(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and\\nGovernment Statistical Service, 2011 )esubsequent government\\nstudies do not show this detail. Data shows that 64.3% of the total\\nC&I waste generated in England originated from SMEs with 12.3%\\ngenerated by businesses with less than 10 employees (see Table 2 ).\\nHistorically there has been a focus on the environmental impact\\nof large business but due to economic, social and legislative drivers,\\nlarger businesses, in general, have well established waste man-\\nagement systems. For many SMEs this is not the case.\\nIn England Duty of Care legislation sets out the responsibility of\\nbusinesses towards managing the waste they generate. The legis-\\nlation aims to ensure that the waste generated does not cause harm\\nto the environment and human health. Under Duty of Care busi-\\nnesses must ensure the waste they produce is managed in a\\nresponsible way and it is illegal for businesses to place waste they\\ngenerate in services for household waste. In other countries similar\\nlegislation exists. For example in the USA and Australia it is com-\\nmon for conditions on the use of bins and storage of waste to be set\\nout in ordinances eseeCity and County of Denver, Colorado (2016)\\nCode of Ordinances Chapter 48 Waste Management , and the City of\\nSydney (2013) Waste Policy Local Approvals Policy For Managing\\nWaste In Public Places . Despite the levels of waste generated frombusinesses there are surprisingly few journal papers on the man-\\nagement of C &I waste and compliance with Duty of Care regula-\\ntions or similar regulations in other jurisdictions.\\n2. Aim and contribution to knowledge\\nThis paper presents the results of research conducted in Brigh-\\nton and Hove City on the south coast of England focusing on the\\nmanagement of waste in SMEs and compliance with Duty of Care\\nregulations. The aims were to (i) build on existing literature to\\nunderstand how SMEs are currently managing their waste (ii) to\\nunderstand levels of compliance with the Duty of Care regulations\\n(iii) through waste composition analysis estimate levels of C &I\\nwaste illegally entering the household waste stream (iv) consider\\nthe implications of current practice and make recommendations.\\nThe research contributes to the limited knowledge of how\\nbusinesses are currently managing their waste and levels of\\ncompliance with Duty of Care regulations. In addition to collating\\ndata from 100 SMEs through semi-structured interviews, it is the\\nﬁrst study that the author is aware of which attempts to estimate\\nlevels of business waste abuse of household services through un-\\ndertaking waste composition analysis. With global policy makers\\nincreasingly focusing on the Circular Economy the research is the\\nﬁrst study to estimate levels of resource leakage of recyclable and\\nbiowaste from SMEs entering the residual household stream thatshould be managed more appropriately. The study presents in-\\ndicators to identify C &I waste entering the household waste stream\\nwhich could assist researchers undertaking similar research and\\nhighlights a range of implications associated with non-compliance\\nwith Duty of Care. Given the levels of waste generated, improvedresource recovery in SMEs could have a signi ﬁcant environmental,\\neconomic and social bene ﬁts.\\nThe legal framework and system for managing C &I waste in\\nEngland is presented followed by a review of literature on\\ncompliance with Duty of Care. The methods adopted are presented\\nfollowed by the results, discussion and conclusion.Table 1\\nDeﬁnition, arisings and management of Commercial and Industrial Waste in England .

Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 2 3. Management of the C &I waste stream in England\\n3.1. Duty of Care legislation\\nThe C &I waste stream is diverse and complex with many vari-\\nables. The waste ranges from specialist chemicals through to ma-\\nterials similar in composition to the household stream. The waste is\\ngenerated from single employee enterprises through to multina-\\ntional businesses. Section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act\\n1990 places a Duty of Care on all businesses to ensure that any\\ncontrolled waste produced as part of their business or within their\\nworkplace is handled safely and within the law ( Great Britain,\\n1990 ). The regulations require businesses not to leave waste or\\nrecycling out on the street without arrangements for its collection.\\nThe waste must be contained properly so it does not spill onto the\\npavement or attacked by vermin. Businesses are responsible for\\ntheir waste until it has been collected and they must ensure that\\ntheir service provider is a licensed waste carrier registered with the\\nEnvironment Agency, the regulatory body for waste in England. A\\nWaste Carriers License means the service provider is legally\\nallowed to collect and transport waste.\\nThroughout the management of waste there is a system of\\nWaste Transfer Notes that records the transfer of waste from one\\nparty to another therefore providing an audit stream. Fig. 1 pro-\\nvides an overview of the information required on the Waste\\nTransfer Note. Businesses are legally required to keep copies of\\nWaste Transfer Notes for 2 years as proof of compliance with Duty\\nof Care. Transfer notes are issued every time waste is collected\\nhowever where collection arrangements are consistent, for\\nexample the same types and quantities of waste are collected each\\nweek, a single transfer note might be issued to cover the year. It is\\nestimated that 23 million Waste Transfer Notes are produced\\nannually and some 50 million are in storage at one time ( Lee, 2013 ).\\nTo reduce the level of paperwork and to develop a system where\\nthe information on these notes could be utilised to improve data on\\nthe levels and management of C &I waste, an electronic version\\ncalled EDOC was launched in 2014. The system is voluntary and\\ncould be used by local authorities, private companies or waste\\nproducers, and by the beginning of 2017 there were over 5000\\nactive users ( Edoconline, 2017 ).In order to meet Duty of Care businesses have two main options.\\nThey could pay the local authority to collect their waste. In England\\nlocal authorities have a legal obligation to manage household waste\\nbut they also have a duty to arrange for the collection of waste from\\nbusinesses if requested ( Great Britain, 1990 ). This system dates to\\nthe Public Health Act of 1936 where local authorities were\\nempowered, but not obliged to collect waste from businesses and\\nthe local authority could make a reasonable charge for collection\\n(Great Britain, 1936 ). At present 68% of local authorities provide a\\nbusiness residual waste collection service and 49% provide a busi-\\nness recycling collection however the range of materials collected\\nfor recycling varies: whereas 97% of these authorities collect\\ncardboard, only 39% collect plastic bottles and 9% food waste\\n(Waste Resources Action Programme, 2013 ).\\nAlternatively, businesses could enter contracts with private\\nwaste suppliers ranging from small independent businesses\\nthrough to multi-national companies. GHK (2010) investigated the\\nmanagement of waste from 1517 SMEs and only 29% of the largest\\nSMEs used local authorities for recycling services compared to 68%\\nfor sole traders. This is likely to be due to the private contractors\\nbeing able to offer a more comprehensive and ﬂexible service than\\nlocal authorities ( GHK, 2010 ). According to the Federation of Small\\nBusinesses (2010) 35% of small businesses are dependent on private\\nwaste management contractors as the local authority in their area\\ndoes not offer a service (cited by 45%), private companies meet their\\nneeds more ef ﬁciently (cited by 27%) or that private companies\\noffer a cheaper service (cited by 23%). The private sector playing an\\nimportant role in the management of C &I waste is not new. Data\\nfrom 1991 shows that of the 15.3 million tonnes of C &I being\\ngenerated in England, 80% was collected by the private sector\\n(Department of Energy, 1991 ). Globally the approach towards\\nmanagement of C &I waste varies and in some countries businesses\\nare reliant on private waste companies for collection and local\\nauthorities have never offered a collection and stopped their ser-\\nvices. For example: the City of Copenhagen, Denmark no longer\\ncollects waste and recycling from businesses ( City of Copenhagen,\\n2018 ); in the 1950s New York City ’s Department of Sanitation\\nstopped collecting C &I waste and transferred responsibility to the\\nprivate sector ( New York City Department of Sanitation, 2012 ).\\nNon-compliance with Duty of Care could have a range of\\nWaste Transfer \\nNotes: \\nrequiredThe type waste being managed using the List of Wastes (LoW) \\nor European Waste Catalogue (EWC)  (both legally recognised \\n \\ncontainment \\nTime and place of \\ntransfer\\nSIC code (Standard Industrial \\nfor the holder of the waste (this is a \\nsystem for recording business type)Name and address of the transferor \\nand transferee (person receiving the \\nwaste) and their signaturesCapacity in which the transferor and \\ntransferee  \\nproducer, importer or registered waste \\ncarrier, broker or dealer) act in that capacity (e.g. their permit \\nnumber  \\nFig. 1. Information required on a Waste Transfer Note .(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2016 ).R. Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 3 implications. Firstly, there is no evidence that a business is man-\\naging its waste responsibly and they could be using the household\\nwaste services at the expense of taxpayers. In England households\\npay Council Tax and some of that revenue contributes towards\\ncovering the cost of waste services but only for household waste - it\\nis illegal for businesses to use household services to manage their\\nwaste or recycling, even for micro businesses or businesses based at\\nhome. Under section 34 A (2) of the Environmental Protection Act\\n1990 ( Great Britain, 1990 ) businesses can be issued with a Fixed\\nPenalty Notice of £300 if they fail to produce a Waste Transfer Note.\\nA business that is not having waste collected could illegally be\\ndumping the waste, this is known as ﬂy tipping. The business could\\neither dump the waste themselves or pay to have their waste\\ncollected by an unlicensed contractor who then dumps the waste in\\npublic spaces or on private land. Fly tipping is a signi ﬁcant problem\\nin England with approximately 1 million reported incidents\\nannually costing local authorities £57.7 million to clear up\\n(Department for Environment, 2017 ). In 2018/19 70,000 of these\\nincidents involved C &I waste, a 3% increase on the previous year\\n(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and\\nGovernment Statistical Service, 2019b ). Fly tipping involving C &I\\nwaste is not a new problem; research from the early 1980s by the\\nLondon Wide Initiative On Fly Tipping (1984) estimated between\\n600,000 and 1 million tonnes of waste was being ﬂy tipped\\nannually with C &I identi ﬁed as being a key contributor.\\n3.2. Review of literature on Duty of Care compliance\\nFew previous journal papers have researched compliance with\\nDuty of Care regulations in England or compliance with similar\\nregulations in other countries. Wilson led on the two most in-depth\\npeer reviewed studies to date assessing compliance with a range of\\nenvironmental regulations, including Duty of Care, within SMEs.\\nWhilst both studies had small sample sizes a detailed evaluation of\\ncompliance was conducted through visiting premises and inter-\\nviewing SMEs. In the ﬁrst study a three-stage assessment was un-\\ndertaken with 36 SMEs including analysing the detail of\\ninformation recorded on Waste Transfer Notes. Only 28.0% were\\nfound to be completely compliant with the Duty of Care regulations\\n(Wilson et al., 2007 ). Further assessment was undertaken at 44\\nadditional SMEs and 35.5% were compliant ( Wilson et al., 2015 ).\\nRadwan et al. (2010) similarly undertook face to face interviews\\nwith nine small hotels to understand level of compliance with Duty\\nof Care. They found that most hotel owners were unaware of their\\nlegal requirements for disposing of waste with some illegally using\\nthe household services. However, the study was narrow in scope\\nonly looking at hotels and again had a limited sample size of 9.\\nAll other studies to date have been commissioned by the waste\\nmanagement industry as they have a vested interest in under-\\nstanding how businesses manage their waste as historically there\\nhas been a problem with businesses using household waste ser-\\nvices. SMEs have been motivated by short term gains and many\\nsmall businesses took their waste home and disposed of it through\\nthe domestic route thereby avoiding charges ( House of Lords\\nScience and Technology Committee, 2008 ). This view has been\\nsupported in studies commissioned to estimate levels of C &I waste\\narisings and management. A common method has been to survey a\\nrepresentative sample of businesses based on sector and number of\\nemployees and then extrapolate the results. Studies including\\nJacobs (2011) and Urban Mines (2011) have omitted surveying\\nbusinesses with less than 5 employees as the assumption was that\\nmuch of this waste would be entering the household waste stream.\\nIn the GHK (2010) study telephone surveys were conducted\\nwith 1517 businesses of which 31% claimed they had not heard of\\nDuty of Care and a third stated that they did not have their waste orrecycling collected. There was a correlation between the number of\\nemployees and illegal use of household services: 40% of SMEs with\\nless than four employees were using household services, compared\\nto 5% with over 20 employees, and none for SMEs with over 100\\nemployees.\\nThe Right Waste, Right Place campaign was launched in 2016\\nwhich is managed by the Environmental Services Association and\\nsupported by the Environment Agency, Chartered Institution of\\nWastes Management and the Environmental Services Association\\nEnvironment Trust. The campaign aims to increase awareness of\\nDuty of Care amongst businesses and contains lots of useful re-\\nsources and clear guidance on the requirements of businesses to\\ncomply with regulations ( Right Waste, Right Place, 2017 ). In 2016\\nthe campaign published data showing there continues to be high\\nlevels of non-compliance with 46% of businesses not knowing what\\nhappens to their waste once it leaves site and a third not sure\\nwhether they completed or kept Waste Transfer Notes ( Right\\nWaste, Right Place, 2017 ).\\nTable 3 presents results of local authority commissioned studies\\nevaluating compliance with Duty of Care Regulations within SMEs.\\nIn each between 5% and 35% of businesses stated they were illegallyusing household services to manage their waste. A limitation is that\\nthese studies pre-date 2010 and the period of austerity in the UK.\\nPrior to austerity the government had several initiatives to support\\nlocal authorities conduct research into waste including the Waste\\nImplementation Programme (WIP) and Business Resource Ef ﬁ-\\nciency &Waste Centre for Local Authorities (BREW). Post austerity\\nsimilar programmes have not been established funding more\\nrecent research.\\nA range of methods were deployed in these studies. Derbyshire\\nCounty Council (2007) ,Lancaster City Council (2006) and YouGov\\n(UK) used self-completion questionnaires. Studies also deployed\\nonline ( YouGov, 2007 ) or telephone surveys ( Entec, 2008 ) without\\nvisiting businesses in person. As explored in the methodology these\\napproaches have limitations.\\nHousehold services where C &I waste could illegally be depos-\\nited include public litter bins, bring sites (central places located\\ntypically in car parks or shopping areas where people can take\\nmaterials for recycling), kerbside collections and Household Waste\\nRecycling Sites.\\nHousehold Waste Recycling Sites are centralised facilities to\\nwhere the public can take waste that would not be collected as part\\nof the normal collection service efor example bulky waste, garden\\nwaste, or quantities of waste over the limit the local authority\\nwould collect from the kerbside. Historically there has been a\\nproblem with businesses illegally using these facilities. Cameron-\\nBeaumont and Bridgwater (2002) undertook the most detailed\\nnationwide study to date to evaluate business waste abuse at\\nHousehold Waste Recycling Sites. The study involved observing\\nwaste entering 10 Household Waste Recycling Sites in the Bristol\\narea of England for a week. All vehicles entering the sites were\\nobserved and through a combination of vehicle type, type of waste\\nbeing delivered, bins used, presence of objects indicating a trader\\n(such as tools/invoices), and the subjective view of the surveyor, an\\nassessment was made on if the waste originated from a trader. The\\nsurveyor also made an estimate of the volume of waste beingdeposited. However, the research did not conduct detailed analysis\\nto understand the weights and composition of waste entering the\\nsites to corroborate the observations. It was estimated 13% of waste\\nentering the sites was delivered by businesses - at that time if the\\nﬁgure was extrapolated across England and Wales it would equate\\nto 830,000 tonnes of waste illegally entering sites per annum. In\\n1995 the government announced the Land ﬁll Tax which placed a\\nlevy on each tonne of waste sent to land ﬁll thereby making it more\\nexpensive with the aim of promoting alternatives higher up theR. Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 4 waste hierarchy ( Landﬁll Tax HC Deb November 28, 1995 vol 267\\ncc1063-4). In turn this cost was passed onto the generators of waste\\nwith the cost of collection increasing. Cameron-Beaumont and\\nBridgwater (2002) estimated that business waste illegally\\nentering Household Waste Recycling Sites doubled following the\\nintroduction of the Land ﬁll Tax. As it became more expensive to\\nhave waste collected, businesses looked at alternative ways of\\ndisposing of their waste. In 2009 Hampshire County Council esti-\\nmated that 18% of all waste delivered to Household Waste Recycling\\nSites in the county originated from C &I sources, costing over £1\\nmillion per year to dispose of ( Maynard and Cherrett, 2009 ).\\nIn recent years local authorities have implemented strategies to\\ncut down on business use of Household Waste Recycling Sites\\nincluding height barriers preventing vans from accessing sites,vehicle recognition software to monitor any vehicles frequently\\nusing sites, and security guards. These restrictions combined with\\nother factors such as the recession, materials being diverted to\\nkerbside collections, and better segregation of waste at sites has\\nseen an overall reduction in residual waste entering Household\\nWaste Recycling Sites from 4.2 million tonnes in 2000/01 to 1.7\\nmillion tonnes in 2016/17, a 84.8% reduction ( Department for\\nEnvironment Food and Rural Affairs, 2017 ). Monitoring and\\nenforcing business waste abuse at Household Waste Recycling Sites\\nis somewhat easier than preventing the illegal use of services for\\nhousehold waste at the kerbside or public spaces by businesses. No\\nstudies to date have attempted to identify and quantify levels of C &I\\nwaste being illegally deposited through kerbside collection or\\nhousehold waste services in public spaces.\\n4. Methodology\\n4.1. Phase 1: Interviews with businesses\\nSemi structured interviews were conducted with 100 SMEs in\\nBrighton &Hove City. All participants were recruited by invites\\nsubmitted through business networks or cold calling. Onrecruitment an interview was arranged at a time convenient with\\nthe business. Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-\\nface and on average lasted 40 min. Most studies conducted to\\ndate have involved either self-completion, online or telephone\\nsurveys. This research builds on the approach adopted by Wilson\\nand Radwan through integrating visits to business premises and\\nconducting interviews in person. Interviews have certain advan-\\ntages over self-completion questionnaire efor example the inter-\\nviewer can explain questions that the respondent has not\\nunderstood, can ask for further elaboration of replies ( Phellas et al.,\\n2011 ) and the researcher can check they correctly understand the\\nresponse which is not always possible with written replies\\n(Denscombe, 2014 ).Phellas et al. (2011) suggest being asked\\nquestions by a sympathetic listener is experienced as morerewarding by research participants than being requested to com-\\nplete a form for an anonymous researcher. Conducting interviews\\nin person also means you are likely to get fuller responses\\ncompared to on-line surveys where participants may drop out and\\nin general elicit lower response rates ( Waste and Resources Action\\nProgramme, 2010 ). Through conducting face-to-face interviews\\nand visiting the premises the researcher can also validate the re-\\nsponses ( Phellas et al., 2011 ;Waste and Resources Action\\nProgramme, 2010 ), in particular for this research check the waste\\ncollection arrangements through observing the collection con-\\ntainers present and waste levels.\\nBusinesses were chosen to broadly re ﬂect business types in the\\nCity with 58% of participants from retail, 19% hospitality (including\\nrestaurants, hotels and takeaways), 6% legal services and the\\nremainder from a range of business types. 88% of SMEs interviewed\\nhad less than 10 employees, therefore classi ﬁed by the EU as micro\\nbusinesses, with 61% having less than 4 employees.\\nTo ensure data was collected to provide a true indication of how\\nthe businesses were managing their waste, there was no discussionin regards Duty of Care and their regulatory obligations. Businesses\\nwere questioned on waste management practice, contractual ar-\\nrangements, and on the quantities of waste and recycling theyTable 3\\nResults from a review of studies evaluating compliance with Duty of Care Regulations within SMEs.\\nStudy Location Method Number of\\nbusinessessurveyedFindings on compliance with Duty of Care\\nDerbyshire County\\nCouncil (2007)Derbyshire Self-\\ncompletionsurvey507 15% managed their own waste ewith many using household services.\\nEntec (2008) Rutland Telephone\\nsurvey418 5% were using household waste services.\\nKnowles (2008) Cambridgeshire Cold calling\\nquestionnaire194 17% had compliance issues with many using household services.\\nLancaster City\\nCouncil (2006)Lancaster Mailed\\nquestionnaire150 76% of businesses did not recycle.

Questions\\nalso covered barriers to recycling. Closed questions were analysed\\nthrough categorisation and tallying of answers to identify the total\\nnumber of participants who selected a certain response high-\\nlighting common patterns of behaviour. Thematic analysis was\\nconducted of the open-ended questions using coding, creating\\ncategories for frequent and common phrases or words. All data was\\ncollected in con ﬁdence and analysed anonymously with re-\\nsearchers complying with Data Protection Act guidelines.\\n4.2. Phase 2: Waste composition analysis\\nBrighton and Hove City is home to 275,800 people and located\\non the south coast of England. The city has a population density of\\n33.1 persons per hectare placing it in the 15% most densely popu-\\nlated local authority areas in England ( Ofﬁce of National Statistics,\\n2013 ). 50.2% of the housing stock is ﬂats (a mixture of purpose-\\nbuilt ﬂats, converted or shared houses or apartments in commer-\\ncial buildings) compared to 22.1% for England ( Brighton &Hove\\nCity Council, 2014 ). Historically in England local authorities have\\ncollected waste directly from households either weekly or\\nincreasingly fortnightly. The population density and high level of\\nﬂats has led to historical waste management problems with resi-\\ndents not having space to store waste, or not wanting to keep it in\\ntheir homes, therefore putting waste out on non-collection days. As\\na popular tourist destination and home to two Universities the\\nproblem is exasperated by a high transient population and resi-\\ndents not knowing how the waste collection system works or their\\ncollection day. Being located on the coast, Brighton &Hove has\\nproblems with gulls ripping open bags and thereby littering the\\nstreets. In response in 2004 the City Council trialled communal\\ncontainers for waste collection where residents deposit waste at\\ntheir convenience with the council emptying bins at regular in-\\ntervals. The system has operated in parts of continental Europe for\\nmany years and has now been extended in the city with additional\\ncommunal bins introduced for recycling in 2011. There are now\\naround 300 /C23200 L residual bins on the streets of the city to cater\\nfor approximately 30% of households. This communal approach has\\nbeen adopted by the other UK authorities including Bristol ( Bristol\\nCity Council, 2016 ), Edinburgh ( City of Edinburgh Council, 2010 )\\nand Newcastle ( Newcastle City Council, 2015 ).\\nThe research aimed to understand how much C &I waste was\\nbeing deposited into these containers eagain the containers were\\nfor household waste only and it is illegal for businesses to use them.\\nBased on guidance from the local authority, samples of waste were\\ntaken from 4 areas etwo from the city centre and two from resi-\\ndential areas. A sample from each area was taken on a Monday and\\na Wednesday. It was expected that the levels of C &I waste present\\nwould be higher in the city centre due to the proximity of busi-\\nnesses and on the Monday as this would be following the weekend\\nwhen businesses would have had much of their weekly trade (i.e.waste from Saturday and Sunday would be in the collection for\\nMonday).\\nBin loads were collected as per normal and delivered to a depot\\nfor sorting. The sample was sorted into big bags, small bags, and\\nother waste such as loose bulky waste, and then weighed. All bags\\nwere then checked for evidence of C &I waste ethis included\\nchecking for letter heads, commercial type packaging, receipts,\\ninvoices and bags clearly of different composition to household\\nwaste. C\\n&I waste was then isolated, sorted into categories and\\nweighed.\\nAll staff working on the project complied with the DataProtection Act ethe focus of the research was to understand the\\nlevels and composition of C &I waste rather than identifying indi-\\nvidual businesses for follow up.\\nAt the time of study Brighton and Hove City Council did not offer\\na waste or recycling collection to businesses and therefore com-\\npanies had to use non-public sector providers or take materials to\\ndedicated business waste drop off facilities in order to comply with\\nDuty of Care regulations.\\n5. Results5.1. Phase 1 eInterviews with businesses\\nTable 4 summarises the key results from interviews with the\\nSMEs. Despite the Duty of Care regulations 25% openly stated that\\nthey used household services to manage their residual waste with\\n15% using Household Waste Recycling Sites or public bins, and 12%\\ntaking waste home to be put out in household collections (2% were\\ndoing both).\\nSimilarly, 38% recycled used household waste services with 24%\\nusing public bins or Household Waste Recycling Sites, and 24%taking recycling home to place in kerbside collections (10% were\\ndoing both). 10% of businesses had service providers for collecting\\nrecycling but used household services to manage certain materials\\nincluding plastic bottles, cardboard and metals which they did not\\ngenerate in signi ﬁcant enough quantities to warrant a separate\\ncollection.\\nOnly 70% of businesses interviewed said they had contracts in\\nplace for managing residual waste and 50% for recycling. In total 27\\ndifferent contractors were named for handling waste, recycling or\\nspecialist waste streams such as cooking oil ethis excludes those\\nwith internal systems or who did not want to name their\\ncontractor.\\nBusinesses were given the opportunity to set out barriers to\\nrecycling eunsurprisingly cost (34%), lack of suitable services (25%)\\nand lack of space (20%) were cited as the main barriers (see Fig. 2 ).\\nInterestingly only 3% of businesses stated that they did not produce\\nenough recyclables to warrant a collection.\\nBased on the information supplied by participating businesses it\\nwas possible to make an estimate of weekly waste and recycling\\ngenerated for 95% of businesses sampled (see Table 5 ). Only 6% of\\nbusinesses generated less than 60 L of waste per week ethe size of\\na typical business waste sack. 72% would need a container more\\nthan 240 L to contain a weeks ’waste and recycling.\\n5.2. Phase 2 eWaste composition analysis\\n3862 kg of waste was collected for analysis with samples vary-\\ning from 726 kg to 1210 kg (see Table 6 - note Sample 3 of 1210 kg is\\nnot included due to no C &I waste being identi ﬁed in the sample).\\nMost of the waste collected was household waste as expected\\nhowever 6.2% was found to be from businesses. Levels of business\\nwaste varied from 11.6% from the City Centre on a Wednesday\\nthrough to 0% in the residential area on the Monday.\\nThe C &I waste stream is heterogeneous - Table 6 contains details\\non the 10 most common materials and items present. Detailed datawas collected on all materials but for brevity these have been\\ncombined into the ‘Other ’category representing 11% of the total\\nC&I waste identi ﬁed. This includes hessian sacks, hair, candles,\\nvarious types of dense plastic items and packaging, polystyrene and\\nfoil.\\nBased upon materials which are commonly included in dry\\nrecyclable materials collections in England 30.6% of the material\\ncould have been recycled. The main dry recyclables were cardboard\\n(15.1%), recyclable paper (7.3%) and glass (3.8%). By far the biggestR. Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 6 category was food waste representing 46.5% of all business waste\\npresent.\\nFrom the composition analysis a range of indicators were\\ndeveloped to identify C &I waste that might be useful for other re-\\nsearchers looking to undertake similar studies (see Table 7 ). Across\\nthe four samples there were 36 incidents of business waste abuse of\\nhousehold services involving 33 businesses (three businesses were\\nfound to be using the bins on two occasions). In addition, there was\\nbusiness waste from other sources but there was a lack of evidence\\nof where it was from. For example, several cardboard boxes had\\ntheir delivery address labels removed eseemingly on purpose to\\navoid detection. 72% of incidents involved businesses from thehospitality industry including cafes, takeaways, restaurants and\\nbed and breakfasts and this is re ﬂected in the large quantity of food\\nwaste present.\\n6. Discussion\\nThe results of the interviews and composition analysis support\\nﬁndings from previous research that a signi ﬁcant number of busi-\\nnesses are still failing to meet their legal Duty of Care requirements\\nand that there is widespread use of household services. Only 70% ofbusinesses had a contractor in place for residual waste and 50% a\\ncontractor for recycling. 27% of businesses openly stated that they\\nused household services for residual waste and 38% for recycling.\\n6.2% of the waste sampled from the household stream was found to\\nbe from businesses. The implications of these ﬁndings are re ﬂected\\non below.\\n6.1. Financial implications to the taxpayer\\nBusinesses using household services are having their waste\\ncollection costs subsidised by taxpayers. In 2016/17 an estimated\\n£835 million was spent by local authorities on waste collection and\\na further £2.0 billion on waste disposal ( Department for\\nCommunities and Local Government and National Statistics,\\n2016 ).

Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 7 stream consisted of waste originating from C &I sources and the\\ninterviews support the ﬁndings from other studies that many\\nbusinesses openly admit to using household services. Even if\\nbusiness waste levels were as low as 1% of the household waste\\nstream nationally savings of £28 million could be achieved from not\\ncollecting and disposing of this waste. The diversion of this waste\\nfrom the household waste stream could generate signi ﬁcant\\nﬁnancial savings to local authorities with money redirected to\\npriority areas such as health care and education.\\n6.2. Unfair economic advantage over competitors\\nBusinesses that use household services have an economic\\nadvantage over their competitors who are being responsible and\\nfulﬁlling their Duty of Care obligations. A claim made by some SMEs\\nis that they do not generate enough material to warrant payment\\nfor a separate waste or recycling collection ( GHK, 2010 ). It was\\npossible to estimate waste and recycling arisings per week for 95%\\nof businesses sampled. Only 6% generated less than 60 L per week e\\nthe size of a typical sack, and only 16% less than 140 L, the size of a\\ntypical wheeled bin. The average arisings for those businesses that\\ndid not have a contractor was 271 L.\\nWhen questioned regarding barriers to recycling only 3% cited\\nnot generating enough waste as being a barrier to recycling. The\\nresults would suggest that for most SMEs sampled they generate\\nenough waste to justify, at the very least, a residual waste collec-\\ntion. Other barriers such as will to recycle, space, cost and access to\\nservices are more signi ﬁcant. Similar barriers to recycling in SMEs\\nwere identi ﬁed by the Federation of Small Businesses (2011) ,GHK\\n(2010) ,Parsons and Kriwoken (2009) ,Radwan et al. (2010) and\\ntheWaste Resources Action Programme (2011) .\\n6.3. Public health implications\\nAn important issue is the potential impacts on public health of\\nbusinesses using household services. 46.5% of the waste sampled\\nwas food waste and unless this is managed responsibly this could\\nhave severe impacts upon public health. During the analysis nearly\\n50 kg of raw chicken carcases and bones, evidently from a quick\\nserve restaurant, were found deposited within the household\\nstream. In addition to illegally using household services the busi-\\nness was in non-compliance with the Animal Bi-Product Regula-\\ntions which sets out the requirement for managing food waste\\n(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2011b ) and\\ntherefore putting public health at risk.6.4. Resource leakage\\nThe research highlights the leakage of valuable resources from\\nbusiness waste entering the household stream. Combined food\\nwaste and dry recyclable materials totalled 77.1% which could have\\nbeen managed in a more sustainable way with elements recycled,\\ncomposted or processed through anaerobic digestion. Policy\\nmakers are focusing on implementing the Circular Economy how-\\never the results from this research highlight that we do not even\\nhave the basic building blocks in place to manage SME waste\\nappropriately.\\n6.5. Impact on progress towards recycling targets\\nUnder the EU Waste Framework EU Directive, 2008 (EU\\nDirective, 2008 /98/EC) the UK combined has a 50% recycling\\ntarget for household waste to meet for 2020. In England the\\nhousehold waste rate has stagnated increasing by 1.1% since 2012\\nreaching 45.2% in 2017 Department for Environment, Food and\\nRural Affairs and Government Statistical Service (2019a) . 45% of\\nlocal authorities have seen their recycling rate reduce over the last\\n2 years ( Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,\\n2017 ). Through businesses using household services the total re-\\nsidual waste level is increased which in turn impacts on the UKs\\nability to meet the 50% recycling target. Conversely it is noted that,\\nto a lesser degree, levels of C &I waste are also entering the\\nhousehold recycling stream thereby contributing towards the\\ntarget. With even higher targets announced in the Waste Frame-\\nwork Directive ( EU Directive, 2018 /851) business waste levels\\nentering the household waste stream could pose a further chal-lenge in achieving these targets.\\n6.6. Impact of austerity measures on enforcement levels\\nIn 2010 the government announced public spending cuts of £81\\nbillion by 2014/15 and therefore resources are becoming scarcer forlocal authorities ( HM Treasury, 2010 ). Research by the Chartered\\nInstitution of Waste Management (CIWM) and Ricardo-AEA (2015)\\nassessed the impact of these austerity cuts across local authority\\nwaste, recycling and street cleansing services across the UK and the\\nRepublic of Ireland through surveying local authority of ﬁcers. Of\\nlocal authorities responding 24% stated they had made cuts to\\nenforcement activities etherefore the inadequate enforcement of\\nexisting regulations is going to deteriorate further.\\nThe survey also asked local authorities for their perception of\\nhow austerity measures had impacted on levels of business waste\\nabuse of household services. When removing non-answers e31%Table 7\\nIndicators used to identify C &I waste present.\\nSector Indicator\\nAll Labels and price tags on products\\nShop lea ﬂets and ﬂyers\\nTill rollsNames on deliveries\\nHospitality Wrappings from portion sized packaging e.g. packs of biscuits, butter/sauce/milk portions\\nPaper towels\\nOrders/receipts\\nCatering sized packaging elarge tin cans, sauce containers, large egg cartons\\nCoffee machine groundsKebab skewersTakeaway packagingNewspapers/magazines with the business name written on Small toiletries typically given out in hotels and guest houses\\nRetail Branded bags\\nShrink wrap from deliveriesR. Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 8 of English local authority of ﬁcers felt there had been increases in\\nbusiness waste abuse at Household Waste Recycling Sites with 13%\\nciting a reduction. In terms of household collections from the\\ndoorstep 30% felt there had been an increase in abuse of household\\nservices with none stating there had been a reduction. This\\nperceived increase could be due to local authorities having less\\nenforcement resources plus businesses having to cut costs during\\nthe recession thereby looking for cheaper ways to get rid of their\\nwaste. Moreover, the reported levels of ﬂy tipping from businesses\\nincreased 3% in 2017/18 compared to the previous year\\n(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and\\nGovernment Statistical Service, 2019b ). Less enforcement re-\\nsources could lead to the ﬂy tipping problem getting even worse.\\nThe Local Government Association (2018) (the body representing\\nlocal government) estimate there will be a £8 billion funding gap\\nfor local authorities by 2025 eas such resources for enforcement\\nwill be further stretched.\\n7. Recommendations for consideration\\nThere are a variety of possible options to improve the manage-\\nment of waste from SMEs and increase compliance with Duty of\\nCare.\\n7.1. Duty of Care register\\nThroughout the country enforcement of Duty of Care by local\\nauthorities varies greatly and there is no available data on the level\\nand type of enforcement activity being applied. At present there is\\nno universal Duty of Care register that collates information on how\\nbusinesses are managing their waste and that have a contract with\\na Licensed Waste Carrier. Development of such a register would\\nhave several key bene ﬁts. It would provide local authorities with\\nknowledge of which businesses are managing their waste respon-\\nsibly with registered contractors. The register could be used to\\nidentify businesses that are potentially not complying with Duty of\\nCare and who the local authority could target to offer support and\\nguidance, and if non-compliance continues, enforcement. Several\\nbodies are engaged with visiting businesses to ensure they are\\ncomplying with environmental and public health regulations. For\\nexample: waste of ﬁcers inspecting business compliance with Duty\\nof Care; water companies inspecting for business compliance with\\ndischarge regulations - under the Water Industry Act 1991 (Great\\nBritain, 1991 ) premises found to be discharging fats, oils, greases\\nand food scraps into the sewer causing blockages or compromise\\nthe safe operation of our assets, can be prosecuted); Environmental\\nHealth Of ﬁcers inspect businesses for health and safety, food hy-\\ngiene and food standards. All these stakeholders have an interest in\\nensuring businesses are managing their waste responsibility and\\ndata gleaned from inspections could be consolidated into the Duty\\nof Care register thereby avoiding the duplication of effort.\\nThe Duty of Care register could also potentially act as a deterrent\\nto business waste abuse of household services. Businesses are\\nrequired to pay business rates and they could be legally required to\\nannually include a copy of their Duty of Care certi ﬁcate when\\nreturning relevant paperwork. Whilst this would require adminis-tration from the local authority the costs could be offset from:\\nsavings accrued from less waste needing to be disposed of through\\nthe household stream; less clear up costs from ﬂy tipping; revenue\\ngenerated from targeted intelligence led enforcement activity\\nwhich would result in either businesses being ﬁned for non-\\ncompliance or signing up to a collection service provided by the\\nprivate or public sector.\\nThe argument against this would be it becomes an added\\nburden to businesses; however, the counter argument is that thosebusinesses being responsible are being disadvantaged by those\\nrival businesses who are acting illegally.\\nVariants of this system are already operating in the USA. In New\\nYork City under the 1996 Recycling Requirements for Licensees pri-\\nvate waste management companies are required to submit a list of\\ncustomers on a bi-annual basis to the Business Integrity Commis-\\nsion who regulate the private waste sector in the City. This includes\\ncontact details of all customers, the date on which services\\ncommenced, total charge per month and where the material was\\ntaken to ( New York Department of Sanitation, 2012 ). A similar\\nsystem operates in other parts of the USA such as San Diego ( City of\\nSan Diego, 2017 ). A variation is where businesses themselves are\\nrequired to supply evidence of their waste management arrange-\\nments. For example, businesses have been legally required to\\nrecycle in Philadelphia since 1994 under the Pennsylvania Act 101\\nand City Ordinance 1251(A) ( City of Philadelphia, 2018 ). Businesses\\nare required to ﬁll out a recycling plan on-line explaining the\\nrecycling activities of the business and details of the contractor e\\nhence the City has records of which businesses are complying with\\nregulations. However there have been concerns expressed\\nregarding the effectiveness of the system with many businessesreportedly not submitting recycling plans and lack of follow up\\nfrom authorities ( McDaniel and Bond, 2017 ).\\n7.2. Increased accessibility for SMEs to services\\nIn England there is a clear delineation between the household\\nand C &I waste stream ehowever in other countries the waste\\nstreams are closer aligned. In some countries business generating\\nless than a certain quantity of waste or located in a speci ﬁc\\ngeographical area are permitted to use household services thereby\\nsupporting SMEs who want to recycle. Globally there are many\\nmodels that have been implemented: in Antwerp, Belgium small\\nbusinesses are allowed to use households services (pers com,\\n2015); in Baltimore, USA businesses located within residential\\ncommunities may participate in the recycling programme free of\\ncharge ( Baltimore City Department of Public Works, 2018 ); in\\nLouisville, USA businesses that generate 4 or less 360 L containers\\nof waste per week located in Urban Services District are offered the\\nsame service as households (businesses generating more waste\\nhave to contract a private hauler) ( City of Louisville, 2005 ). Adop-\\ntion of a similar system in England would increase accessibility of\\nrecycling services to SMEs thereby reducing resource leakage plus\\nadditional ef ﬁciencies. McLeod et al. (2011) researched the poten-\\ntial resource ef ﬁciency savings of collecting waste from 25,000\\nhomes and 577 commercial premises together. This approach led to\\na 9.8% reduction in vehicle mileage equating to savings of £36,800\\nand carbon equivalent savings of 2688 kg. In England whilst waste\\nand recycling are collected by different service providers depend-\\ning on the origin of the waste it often ends up being taken to the\\nsame facility. The Environmental Services Association (2016) has\\nadvocated increased harmonisation to manage household and C &I\\nwaste together. Policy Exchange (2009) have supported the merger\\nof the C &I and household waste stream placing a duty on local\\nauthorities to collect from small businesses ethis approach would\\nimprove services for businesses, yield ef ﬁciency savings, and lead to\\nbetter planning for C &I waste.\\n8. Conclusion\\nThe research highlights the inadequacies of the existing\\napproach to managing waste from SMEs in England. The results\\nreinforce those from previous studies that a signi ﬁcant number of\\nSMEs are failing to comply with Duty of Care Regulations and are\\nusing household services to dispose of their waste. 27% ofR. Woodard / Journal of Cleaner Production 278 (2021) 123770 9 businesses stated that they used household services for residual\\nwaste and 38% for recycling. Of the residual waste sampled 6.2% of\\nthe waste sampled originated from businesses and 77.1% was dry\\nrecyclable materials or food waste eresources are being wasted.\\nGlobally waste from SMEs is an important and often overlooked\\nwaste stream. If Circular Economy principles are to be achieved to\\nneed to set up smarter systems to manage waste ﬂows from SMEs.\\nThis includes enforcement of relevant legislation, increasing\\nawareness of waste through further supporting initiatives such as\\n‘Right Waste, Right Place ’and importantly developing a more ef-\\nfectives holistic waste management system which places resources\\nat the core. This paper presents some recommendations for\\nconsideration ranging from developing a Duty of Care register to\\nopening household services to SMEs. In the 2018 Waste Strategy\\nthe government pledged to improve the management of waste\\nfrom SMEs including introducing new legislation to make separa-\\ntion of dry recyclable materials mandatory and investigating how\\nshared services could help to improve recycling in SMEs. Whilst\\nencouraging similar pledges have been made in the past with\\nlimited impact. Interestingly recent governments reports show that\\nsmall and micro businesses would not be required to separatematerials for separate collection until 2029 and 2032 respectively e\\nover a decade after the government announced proposals in the\\nWaste Strategy.\\nSuggestions for further work are to duplicate the study in other\\nparts of the country for comparison, and to conduct a more detailed\\nreview on systems implemented in other countries to manage\\nwaste from SMEs. Other suggestions are to model the potential\\nresource ef ﬁciency bene ﬁts from closer integration of the house-\\nhold and SME waste streams, and to better understand the ap-\\nproaches being used by local authorities to raise awareness\\namongst business to their Duty of Care requirements and\\nenforcement activity eincluding the adoption of EDOC.

This  is  an\\nopen  access  article  under  the  CC  BY-NC-ND  license  (http://creative-\\ncommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).\\nIntroduction\\nCurrently  the  global  average  plastic  recycling  rate  is\\nbelow  20%  [1/C15].  This  low  plastic  recycling  rate  is  widely\\naddressed  and  targeted  for  example,  in  European  policy\\nor  the  U.S.  Plastics  Pact  [2–6].  Increasing  plastic  recycling\\nrates  is  important  to  become  a  sustainable  and  resource-\\nefﬁcient  society  as  plastics  released  in  the  environment\\ncause  environmental  problems  and  the  traditional  pro-\\nduction  of  plastics  is  dependent  on  our  fossil  fuel  reserves\\n[7–9].  The  focus  of  policy  guidelines  as  well  as  researchoften  lies  on  post-consumer  packaging  waste  [10],  as  it  is\\nthe  largest  plastic  waste  stream  [7].  In  this,  the  terminol-\\nogy  of  consumption  means  household  consumption,\\nwhereas  the  ISO  deﬁnition  of  ‘post-consumer’  in  fact\\nrelates  to  all  activities  where  waste  is  disposed  by  an\\nend-user,  including  end-users  that  are  for  example,  com-\\npanies  (industrial  waste)  or  shops  (commercial  waste).\\nPost-consumer  waste  of  industrial  or  commercial  origins  is\\nquite  diverse,  in  type,  composition  and  level  of  contami-\\nnation  depending  strongly  on  its  disposing  entity.  How-\\never,  this  waste  is  signiﬁcantly  different  from  household\\nwaste.  Some  examples  include  ﬂexible  ﬁlm  that  is  used  as\\nsecondary  packaging  (be  it  around  pallets  or  for  individual\\nitems  like  in  clothing  shops),  EPS  for  packaging  purposes\\nand  rigid  plastics  from  temporary  products  like  displays  or\\ncrates  (Pots,  tubes,  and  trays  (PTTs),  crates,  canisters/\\nbarrels).  Quantities  and  recycling  rates  for  these  speciﬁc\\nplastic  waste  streams  are  typically  poorly  reported  in\\nscientiﬁc  and  grey  literature,  if  reported  at  all.\\nThe  goal  of  this  manuscript  is  therefore  twofold:  ﬁrstly,  to\\naddress  the  often  confusing  terminology  regarding  types\\nof  plastic  waste  and  secondly,  to  review  the  most  recent\\nstudies  that  address  quantities,  composition,  collection,\\nand  recycling  potential  of  non-household  end-use  plastic\\nwaste.  Additionally,  we  discuss  the  bottlenecks  and\\nopportunities  for  this  type  of  plastic  waste  to  contribute\\nto  a  circular  economy  for  plastics.\\nTerminology\\nThe  ﬁrst  issue  is  that  the  terminology  and  commonly  used\\ndeﬁnitions  do  not  speciﬁcally  address  non-household\\nend-use  plastics.  ISO  14021:2016  distinguishes  pre-  and\\npost-consumer  material  [11].  Pre-consumer  material,\\noften  referred  to  as  post-industrial  waste,  is  deﬁned  as\\n‘material  diverted  from  the  waste  stream  during  a\\nmanufacturing  process.  Excluded  is  reutilization  of  mate-\\nrials  such  as  rework,  regrind  or  scrap  generated  in  a\\nprocess  and  capable  of  being  reclaimed  within  the  same\\nprocess  that  generated  it.’  [11].  The  same  ISO  norm\\ndeﬁnes  post-consumer  material  as  waste  generated  by\\n‘end-users  such  as  commercial,  industrial  and  institutional\\nfacilities,  next  to  households’  [11].  This  deﬁnition  is\\ncommonly  used,  for  example,  in  Eurostat  [12]  or  EPA\\n[13]  databases.  In  parallel,  the  term  municipal  waste  is  used\\nto  address  wastes  collected  by  municipalities  no  matter\\nthe  origin  (e.g.  household,  commercial,  institutional)  [14–Available  online  at  www.sciencedirect.com\\nScienceDirect\\nwww.sciencedirect.com  Current  Opinion  in  Chemical  Engineering  2021,  1:100680 17].  The  common  terms  ‘post-consumer  waste’  and\\n‘municipal  waste’  are  thus  a  group  term  for  both  house-\\nhold  and  non-household  waste.  An  overview  of  commonly\\nused  terminology  can  be  found  in  Figure  1.\\nWhen  looking  deeper  into  these  types  of  waste,  we  can\\nsee  that  they  are  inherently  different.  Plastic  waste  from\\nhouseholds  often  comprises  a  complex  material  mix  that\\nis  prone  to  contaminations,  as  it  contains  typical  products\\nbought  for  example,  in  supermarkets  as  PET  Bottles,\\nPET  trays,  PE  bottles,  PP  bottles  and  trays,  ﬁlms  such  as\\nfood  wraps,  and  so  on.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  end-\\nuser  is  a  business,  industry  or  institution,  typical  plastic\\nwaste  products  are  secondary  packaging  that  might  be\\neligible  for  high  end  recycling  on  their  own  but  might  not\\nend  up  in  a  suitable  recycling  scheme.  Looking  to  thedifference  in  typology  of  waste,  it  can  be  questioned  if\\nthey  should  fall  within  the  same  terminological  classiﬁ-\\ncation,  being  ‘post-consumer’.\\nAnother  commonly  used  terminology  is  commercial  and\\nindustrial  (C&I)  waste.  This  might  cause  confusion,  as\\npre-consumer  waste  is  also  referred  to  as  post-industrial\\nwaste,  which  also  includes  industrial  scraps  of  high  purity.\\nIn  this  sense,  there  is  a  distinction  between  industry  that\\nproduces,  and  industry  that  ‘consumes’.  Following  a\\nstandardized  classiﬁcation  for  economic  activities,  for\\nexample,  the  European  ‘NACE’  codes  [https://ec.\\neuropa.eu/competition/mer gers/cases/index/nace_all.\\nhtml],  plastic  producing  sectors  include  amongst  others\\n‘20.16  Manufacture  of  plastics  in  primary  forms’  and  ‘22.2\\nManufacture  of  plastic  products’.  All  other  sectors  in  fact2  Frontiers:  energy,  environment  and  sustainability:  plastics  in  the  environment\\nFigure  1\\nManufacturing of \\ninte rmediate   prod ucts\\nManu fac turing of \\narticles for end-  usePlastics converting \\nsecto rs\\nConv erting inte  rmediate \\nprod ucts to  pac kaging or \\nconsumer goods\\nEnd-use & disposal  in \\nindustrial op  erations\\nEnd-use & dispo  sal  in \\ncomm ercial op  erationsIndustrial & \\ncomm ercial secto  rs\\nEnd-use & dispo  sal o f \\npac kaging  or \\nconsumer goodsHouseholds\\nTowards wast  e mana  gementPost-consumer materi  al (I SO) Pre-con  sumer materi  al (I SO)\\nNon-mun  icipal wast  e/ po st-industrial waste  Munici  pal waste\\nPre-consumer \\nend-use pla  stic wasteNon-ho  usehold\\nend-use pla  stic wasteHousehold\\nend-use pla  stic wasteCommonly\\nused definitionsSuggested \\ndefinition\\nCurrent Opinion in Chemical Engineering\\nOverview  of  used  definitions  on  the  example  of  plastic  waste.

As  an  exam-\\nple,  PET-trays  and  LDPE  wrapping  ﬁlm  that  serves  as\\npackaging  of  car  parts  in  a  car  manufacturing  company\\nand  is  disposed  there,  is  not  post-industrial  waste,  but\\nshould  be  more  clearly  classiﬁed  separately.  Therefore,\\nwe  propose  to  consistently  differentiate  between  the\\nterminology  ‘non-household  end-use  plastics’  and\\n‘household  end-use  plastics’.  Note  that  in  this  proposed\\nterminology,  the  term  ‘consumption’  is  also  replaced  by\\n‘end-use’,  as  this  seems  more  suited  to  capture  what\\nhappens  to  plastic  as  consumption  might  be  more  suited\\nfor  applications  such  as  food.\\nQuantities\\nTo  our  knowledge,  there  is  hardly  any  scientiﬁc  study\\nwith  a  systematic  focus  on  solely  non-household  end-use\\nplastics  and  its  potential  for  the  circular  economy.  The\\nfew  studies  on  this  topic  focus  on  mixed  commercial  and\\nindustrial  waste,  including  but  not  limited  to  plastics.\\nTable  1  gives  an  overview  on  the  studies  available  on  non-\\nhousehold  (plastic)  waste  typically  performed  with  a\\nspeciﬁc  regional  focus.\\nAlready  in  2000  it  was  pointed  out  that  literature  with\\nnon-household  type  waste  in  general  is  scarce  [27].  Sev-\\neral  other  authors  conﬁrm  that  this  waste  streams  are  notwell  recorded  in  the  EU  and  that  detailed  global  data  are\\nmissing  [1/C15,26/C15,28].  This  is  said  very  aptly  by  De  Weerdt\\net  al.  in  a  study  focusing  on  the  effect  of  waste  incineration\\ntaxation  by  noticing  the  asymmetry  between  the  limited\\nstudies  compared  to  its  amounts  of  waste  generation,\\ncalling  it  even  ‘paradoxical’  [29].  This  lack  of  data  hinders\\npolicy  makers  to  set  clear  target  and  recognition  of\\nopportunities  [26/C15].\\nThose  presented  studies  (Table  1)  give  a  ﬁrst  glimpse  on\\nthe  quantities  of  non-household  end-use  plastic  waste\\nproduced,  but  it  remains  hard  to  deduct  numbers  with\\ngreat  conﬁdence.  The  scarce  data  sources  indicate  that\\nnon-household  type  waste  streams,  when  collected\\ncomingled  with  other  materials,  have  a  plastic  content\\nof  approximately  10–20%.

Whole  frac-\\ntions  of  mixed  commercial  waste,  like  plastics,  could  in  fact\\nbe  recyclable  but  due  to  technical  issues  (e.g.  disassem-\\nbling  of  composites)  or  contamination  this  is  not  econom-\\nically  feasible  [18].  Therefore  it  is  commonly  used  as  solid\\nrecovered  fuel  (SRF)  thanks  to  high  caloric  value  and  low\\nwater  content  [18,37].\\nTo  our  knowledge,  there  are  no  studies  yet  on  the\\nrecycling  potential  merely  focusing  on  non-household\\nend-use  plastics.  Some  sources  state  that  this  waste  tends\\nto  be  of  higher  quality  compared  to  household  plastic\\nwaste  [1/C15,26/C15].  According  to  the  author’s  experience,  this\\nvaluable  material  is  often  downgraded  by  mixed  collec-\\ntion,  which  signiﬁcantly  contaminates  the  ‘cleaner’  plas-\\ntics,  turning  recyclable  plastics  into  residual  waste.\\nAnalyzing  the  studies  discussed  in  Sections  ‘Quantities’\\nand  ‘Composition’  gives  a  glimpse  on  the  quantities  of\\nnon-household  end-use  plastic,  which  can  give  a  ﬁrst\\nestimation  on  their  potential  contribution  to  the  circular\\neconomy.

We  therefore  propose  astrategy  to  mitigate  the  current  status  quo  of  recycling\\nnon-household  end-use  plastic  waste,  which  is  depicted\\nin  Figure  2.\\nFirst,  a  clear  terminology  has  to  be  introduced  that  allows\\nsetting  the  right  focus  on  data  collection,  research,  and\\npolicymaking.  We  propose  to  systematically  subdivide\\nthe  ISO  deﬁnition  of  post-consumer  waste  into  household\\nand  non-household  material  and  thereby  acknowledging\\nthe  difference  in  origin,  composition,  and  recycling\\npotential.\\nSecondly,  to  mitigate  arguments  on  the  economic  feasi-\\nbility  of  recycling  these  non-household  fraction,  a  struc-\\ntural  collection  of  data  on  quantities  and  qualities  has  to  be\\ndone  based  on  the  terminology  as  described  above.\\nThereby  it  is  crucial  to  analyze  different  sectorsNon-household  end-use  plastics:  forgotten  plastics  Kleinhans  et  al.  5\\nFigure  2\\nUnd erstand ing the status qu  o by structural \\ncoll ecti on of data of waste generati  on and \\ncompositi  ons per NACE sectorsData on quality   and quantitie  sIntrodu cti on of a clear terminology for \\nnon-h ousehold end-u  se waste for use in data \\ngathering, resea  rch & poli  cy makingCle ar terminology\\nCreati ng local bu  siness  cases, e.g.,   new recycli  ng \\nfaciliti es and  creati ng bus ine ss links  to create a \\nlocal network for a circular economyCirc ular business   casesFinding the optimal trade-off   betwee n suff icient \\nmaterial coll  ecti on to make a coll  ecti on system \\neconomicall  y and  prov iding the best qu  alit y for \\nrecycli ng poss  ible, e.g.,   by source separationTailore  d waste manag  ement\\nBehavior change\\nCurrent Opinion in Chemical Engineering\\nFlowchart  suggestion  to  bring  focus  on  non-household  end-use\\nplastics  in  the  future.

Extended  studies\\non  lumping  strategies  of  different  kind  of  substreams  (e.g.\\nper  sector,  per  polymer  type,  per  contamination  level)  of\\nnon-household  end-use  plastics  to  optimize  the  trade-off\\nbetween  quality  and  quantity  are  needed.  In  this  sense,\\nlumping  can  be  deﬁned  as  the  investigation  on  which\\nplastic  waste  streams  can  be  mixed  or  absolutely  need  to\\nbe  excluded  during  collection  and  recycling  to  ensure\\nbest  recycling  quality  possible.  This  can  depend,  amongst\\nothers,  on  polymer  types,  contamination  level  and\\nquantities.\\nFurther,  we  are  convinced  that  especially  urban  areas\\nhave  a  big  potential  for  developing  tailored  collection\\nsolutions  due  to  the  high  density  of  business  activities.\\nMoreover,  innovative,  and  sustainable  collections  solu-\\ntions,  for  example,  reverse  logistics,  electronic  vehicles  or\\ntransport  bicycles  should  be  investigated.  Also  introduc-\\ning  EPR  schemes  speciﬁcally  for  non-household  end-use\\ncould  provide  more  pronounced  ﬁnancial  incentives  [26/C15].\\nThis  steps  can  be  the  starting  point  to  also  ﬁnd  linkages\\nbetween  industries,  like  recommended  by  Chertow  et  al.,\\nto  create  circular  business  cases  [40].  To  reach  this,  studies\\nlike  Bremner  et  al.  or  Patricio  et  al.  for  multiple  business\\nsectors  with  focus  on  plastic  waste  should  be  conducted\\n[22/C15,33/C15/C15].  The  purpose  of  a  circular  economy  for  plastics,\\nand  thus  for  circular  business  models,  is  to  maintain\\nproducts  and  materials  in  the  loop  through  several\\nvalue-preserving  cycles,  such  as  repair,  reuse,  remanufac-\\nturing  and  recycling  [9].  This  can  be  done  by  tailoring\\nbusiness  models  and  product  design,  amongst  others,  but\\nsince  plastics  often  move  fast  through  the  value  chain  it\\nmight  be  important  to  apply  for  example,  quadruple  helix\\napproaches  to  reach  a  broader  group  of  stakeholders  [9]Lu¨deke-Freund  give  a  comprehensive  review  on  existing\\ncircular  business  models  in  literature  and  conclude  that\\nsix  major  patterns  for  circular  business  models  are:  ‘repair\\nand  maintenance;  reuse  and  redistribution;  refurbishment\\nand  remanufacturing;  recycling;  cascading  and  repurpos-\\ning;  and  organic  feedstock  business  models’  [41].  Accent-\\nure  strategy  (2014)  identiﬁes  the  following  ﬁve  circular\\nbusiness  models  as  most  promising:  resource  recovery,\\nproduct-service  systems,  product-life  extensions,  sharing\\nplatforms  and  circular  value  chains  [42].  Especially  the\\nlatter  (‘circular  value  chains’)  can  be  promising  as  local\\nbusiness  cases  for  non-household  plastic  waste,  for  exam-\\nple,  in  forms  of  a  local  plastic  hub  with  product  makers\\nand  waste  owners  that  share  the  (positive  and  negative)\\nvalue  of  the  circular  plastics.  All  this  is  not  possible\\nwithout  behavior  change  of  businesses  and  business  cases.\\nBeing  open  for  setting  up  a  recycling  system  for  plastics  in\\nbusiness,  using  more  materials  with  recycled  content  or\\nusing  recyclate  in  one’s  own  production,  needs  engaged\\ndecision  makers  in  the  businesses.  A  recent  study  by\\nKhan  et  al.  analyzed  the  barriers  and  drivers  towards\\nrecycling  in  several  businesses  [43].  They  conclude  that\\nthere  is  an  intention-behavior  gap:  businesses  have  posi-\\ntive  intentions  towards  best  practices  in  plastics  recycling\\nbut  seem  to  fail  to  implement  these.  They  recommend\\nthat  governments  have  to  offer  incentives,  disseminating\\nknowledge,  and  creating  networking  platforms  for  collab-\\noration  among  decision  makers  to  overcome  this  [43].\\nConclusions\\nBecause  of  the  lack  of  clear  terminology  and  the  com-\\nmonly  used  division  in  pre-consumer  and  post-consumer\\nwaste,  end-use  plastic  waste  from  non-household  origin  is\\nnot  sufﬁciently  addressed  in  policy  making,  data  gather-\\ning  nor  in  research,  despite  its  high  potential  for  recycling.\\nTherefore,  we  address  them  as  the  ‘forgotten  plastics  of\\nthe  circular  economy’  and  introduce  the  term  non-house-\\nhold  end-use  plastic.\\nThe  limited  number  of  current  studies  on  quantities  of\\nnon-household  waste  like  streams  indicate  to  have  a\\nplastic  content  of  around  10–20%.  We  estimate  a  range\\nof  2800/C07500  kt/a  of  non-household  end-use  plastic\\nwaste  in  the  EU,  but  this  is  prone  to  high  variations  as\\nit  depends  on  the  number,  type,  and  sizes  of  businesses.\\nNon-household  plastics  can  thus  probably  contribute  by\\n10–30%  to  recycling  rate  targets  and  thus  play  an  essential\\nrole  in  the  circular  economy.\\nNevertheless,  overall  data  availability  is  poor  [1/C15,26/C15,27–\\n29].  This  holds  also  for  compositional  analyses.  Only  a  few\\nstudies  show  that  the  main  polymers  in  non-household\\nend-use  plastic  are  of  PE,  PP,  PS  and  PVC  and  the  biggest\\nwaste  type  is  ﬁlm  material  (58%  according  to  Ref.

Following the circular economy principles, this waste should ideally be avoided, and if\\nnot possible, treated to recover resources. This paper con siders the life cycle environmental and economic implica-\\ntions of recovering energy and material resources from food waste, focusing on the UK situation. Four treatmentmethods are considered: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and land ﬁlling. The results show\\nthat per tonne of waste treated, anaerobic digestion has the lowest environmental impacts in 13 out of the 19 cat-\\negories considered in the study, includi ng net-negative global wa rming potential. In-vessel composting is the least\\nsustainable option environmentally, in contrast to being pr eferred over incineration according to the circular econ-\\nomy principles. Incinerati on has the lowest life cycle costs (£71/t), while land ﬁlling is the costliest option (£123/t).\\nManaging the 4.9 Mt of food waste collected annually from UK households via the four methods generates\\n340,000 t CO\\n2eq. and costs £452 m, in addition to causing a numb er of other environment al impacts. However, it\\nalso saves 1.9 PJ of primary energy, primarily due to electri city generation through incineration. If all of this food\\nwaste was incinerated, £103 m and 360,000 t CO 2eq./year could be saved compared to current waste management,\\nrendering incineration a carbon-negative technology. This would also result in savings in 14 other impacts, butwould increase summer smog by 30% and metal depletion by 56%. The environmental bene ﬁts of incineration\\nwould be exceeded only if all food waste was treated by anaerobic digestion, which would save\\n490,000 t CO\\n2eq./year and produce 50% more electricity per tonne of waste than incineration. Anaerobic digestion\\nwould also lead to savings in 14 other impacts compared to the present situation, but would result in a four timeshigher acidi ﬁcation and three times greater emissions of particulate matter. In addition, it would save\\n£251 m/year compared to the current costs. Nevertheless, prevention of avoidable food waste would realise far\\ngreater environmental and economic savings, estimated here at 14 Mt CO\\n2eq. and £10.7 bn annually.\\n© 2019 The Authors.

Introduction\\nWith approximately a third of food intended for human consump-\\ntion wasted through the food supply chains, the loss of embedded re-\\nsources is receiving increasing global attention ( Gustavsson et al.,\\n2011 ). The total production value of global food waste (FW) is esti-\\nmated at $1 trillion, increasing to $2.6 trillion when social and economiccosts are considered ( FAO, 2014 ) and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\\nsions associated with the FW supply chains account for 6.8% of global\\nemissions ( FAO, 2015 ;The World Bank, 2016 ). In their Sustainable De-\\nvelopment Goals (SDG 12.3), the United Nations have stated a target to\\nhalf the per-capita food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030\\n(UN, 2015 ). The issue of food waste is also becoming pertinent in the EU\\nwith the growing pressures to implement a circular economy ( EC,\\n2015 ). In the UK, the food industry has already agreed to reduce food\\nand drink waste across the whole supply chain, but the target set\\nthrough the voluntary Courtauld Commitment 2025 ( WRAP, 2017b )i s\\nnot as ambitious, aiming only for a 20% reduction between 2015 and\\n2025. Food waste reduction ﬁts into the UK's wider environmental com-\\nmitment to the EU's nationally determined contribution (NDC) of a 40%\\nreduction in GHG emissions by 2030 ( EC, 2014 )a n dt oi t ss e l f - s e tt a r g e t\\nfor net zero emissions by 2050 ( UK Government, 2019 ).\\nWithin the EU, the majority of FW is generated by households, with\\nan estimated 47 Mt disposed of each year ( Stenmarck et al., 2016 ). In\\nthe UK, household FW reached a total of 7.3 Mt in 2015 ( Quested and\\nParry, 2017 ). Following a campaign to reduce household FW, a 16% re-\\nduction had been achieved between 2007 and 2012 ( Quested et al.,\\n2013b ), but the trend has since been reversed, with a 4% increase in\\nFW from 2012 to 2015. At present, more than half of the UK household\\nFW is land ﬁlled or incinerated, with the rest treated by anaerobic diges-\\ntion (AD), composted or used as animal feed. Although these methods\\nhelp to deal with existing waste while at the same time recovering en-\\nergy and resources, they also generate additional environmental im-\\npacts and economic costs.\\nThe circular economy principles ( EMF, 2015 ) as well as the waste\\nmanagement hierarchy ( DEFRA, 2018a )f a v o u rA Da n dc o m p o s t i n g\\nover incineration and land ﬁll. However, their environmental and eco-\\nnomic sustainability will vary depending on many factors, including\\nthe composition and volume of waste as well as the geographical region\\nwhere it is generated and treated. This is re ﬂected in previous studies\\nwhich considered the sustainability of treating FW in different coun-\\ntries, whose ﬁndings on the preference of different treatment methods\\ndiffered depending on the location. For example, Oldﬁeld et al. (2016)\\nundertook a national life cycle assessment (LCA) study for Ireland,\\nassessing the global warming, eutrophication and acidi ﬁcation poten-\\ntials of FW treatment via AD, in-vessel composting (IVC), incineration\\nand land ﬁlling, in comparison with waste minimisation. They found\\nthat AD had the lowest impacts of the three treatment options for all\\nthree environmental indicators, but the difference between AD, IVC\\nand incineration was small when compared to waste minimisation,\\nwhich was the best option. The bene ﬁts of waste minimisation were\\nalso discussed by Beretta and Hellweg (2019) , who showed that a 38%\\nreduction in FW in Switzerland would lead to a 41% lower climate\\nchange impact.\\nBernstad and la Cour Jansen (2011) also considered the AD, IVC and\\nincineration but for a Swedish town, focusing on ﬁve impacts: global\\nwarming, acidi ﬁcation, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidants for-\\nmation (summer smog) and nutrient enrichment. Their results sug-\\ngested that AD resulted in the greatest reduction in global warming\\nand photochemical oxidants formation, but both AD and IVC increased\\nnutrient enrichment and acidi ﬁcation in comparison to incineration.\\nAn LCA study based in Seoul showed that producing wet animal feed\\nfrom household FW by sterilising and mixing with corn starch, had\\nthe greatest savings in global warming potential compared to land ﬁlling\\nand composting ( Kim and Kim, 2010 ). For a review of studies in other\\ncountries, see Bernstad and la Cour Jansen (2012) .Some studies of the life cycle costs (LCC) of FW management have\\nalso been carried out to evaluate their economic sustainability. For in-\\nstance, in the follow up to their above-mentioned LCA study ( Kim and\\nKim, 2010 ),Kim et al. (2011) assessed the LCC of the same treatment\\nroutes in Seoul and found that wet feed also had the lowest life cycle\\ncost, when compared to dry feed, land ﬁlling, composting and AD. Two\\nother LCC studies on consumer FW management ( Carlsson Reich,\\n2005 ;Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2015 ) focused primarily on methodology\\nand included only brief case studies for Danish and Swedish systems. In\\na wider study, Martinez-Sanchez et al. (2016) estimated LCC of all FW\\ngenerated in Denmark and found incineration had marginally lower\\ncosts than either co-digestion or conversion to animal feed via the\\nsource separation of plant-derived food waste, when both direct and in-\\ndirect costs were considered. However, the study focused primarily on\\nthe large savings possible if avoidable FW was prevented.\\nAs far as the authors are aware, there are no LCA and LCC studies of\\nFW management for the UK. Apart from one LCA of household FW man-\\nagement in a London borough ( Evangelisti et al., 2014 ) and another on\\nincineration and land ﬁlling of municipal solid waste (MSW) at the UK\\nlevel ( Jeswani and Azapagic, 2016 ), no other studies exist. Therefore,\\nthis paper presents for the ﬁrst time the life cycle environmental im-\\npacts and costs of the four household FW management routes currently\\nused in the UK: AD, IVC, incineration and land ﬁlling. The aim is to iden-\\ntify environmentally and economically the most sustainable options,\\nplacing them in the context of a circular economy. Following the con-\\ncept of the latter, the treatment methods are also compared to the\\navoidance of food waste. The outcomes of this study will be of interest\\nto local authorities, policy makers and consumers.\\nThe next section details the LCA and LCC methodologies applied to\\nevaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of FW treat-\\nment, along with the assumptions and data used in the study. The re-\\nsults are presented and discussed in Section 3 and the conclusions and\\nrecommendations in Section 4 .\\n2. Methods\\nThe LCA study has been completed in accordance with the ISO\\n14040/14044 standards ( ISO, 2006a ;ISO, 2006b ). The LCC methodology\\nis based on guidelines published by Swarr et al. (2011) andHunkeler\\net al. (2008) , which is consistent with and complementary to the LCA\\nmethodology. The following sections detail the goal and scope of the\\nstudy, methods used for the estimation of environmental impacts and\\ncosts, and the inventory data.\\n2.1. Goal and scope\\nThe goal of the study is to estimate the life cycle environmental im-\\npacts and economic costs of the current household FW treatment sys-\\ntem in the UK. This comprises AD, IVC, incineration with energy\\nrecovery and land ﬁll with utilisation of land ﬁll gas (LFG). As all the\\nmethods recover either energy and/or material resources, the aim is to\\nidentify the most sustainable option within the context of a circular\\neconomy. A further goal is to compare the sustainability implications\\nof food treatment with waste avoidance.\\nWhen comparing the treatment methods, the term “food waste ”re-\\nfers to any edible or inedible fractions of food discarded by households –\\nthis is further de ﬁned as avoidable, possibly avoidable and unavoidable\\nFW ( Quested and Parry, 2017 ). When prevention is considered, only the\\navoidable and possibly avoidable fractions are considered as\\npreventable.\\nThe scope of the study, shown in Fig. 1 , encompasses FW collection\\nfrom households, its treatment by one of the above-mentioned methods\\nand recovery of energy and/or materials, including the related environ-\\nmental and revenue credits. Construction of the treatment plants has\\nalso been considered but their decommissioning and the resulting2 P.C. Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 waste are excluded. The environmental impacts of FW are also ex-\\ncluded, i.e. the FW is considered burden-free.\\nThe functional unit is de ﬁned as the “treatment of 1 tonne of house-\\nhold food waste with recovery of resources ”. These results are subse-\\nquently scaled up to the annual amount of household FW currently\\ncollected in the UK.\\n2.2. Estimation of life cycle impacts and costs\\nThe LCA impacts have been estimated following the Hierarchist ReC-\\niPe 1.08 impact assessment method ( Goedkoop et al., 2013 ). In total, 18\\nimpacts are included in this method, all of which are considered. In ad-\\ndition, primary energy demand has also been estimated, using the\\nmethod in GaBi V8 ( Thinkstep, 2017 ). The latter has also been used\\nfor LCA modelling and estimation of the impacts. An uncertainty analy-\\nsis has been carried out using the Monte Carlo method with 10,000 sim-\\nulations for each treatment method, assuming a uniform distribution\\nbetween the minimum and maximum values of the inventory data.\\nThe LCC have been estimated according to Eq. (1)and they comprise\\ncosts to local authorities, operators of treatment facilities and con-\\nsumers:\\nLCC¼CLAþCOþCC £=tF WðÞ ð 1Þ\\nwhere:\\nLCC total life cycle costs of waste treatment option (£/t FW)\\nCLA costs to the local authority (£/t FW)\\nCO cost to the operator of treatment facility (£/t FW)\\nCC costs to the consumer (£/t FW).\\nCosts to the local authority consist of FW collection costs and gate\\nfees:\\nCLA¼CWCþCGF £=tF WðÞ ð 2Þ\\nwhere:\\nCWC costs of waste collection (£/t FW)\\nCGF gate fees (£/t FW).\\nCosts to the operator involve construction and operating costs asso-\\nciated with the waste treatment facility, less any revenue:\\nCO¼CCCþCOC−RO £=tF WðÞ ð 3Þ\\nwhere:\\nCCC capital (overnight) costs of waste treatment facility (£/t FW)\\nCOC operating costs of waste treatment facility (£/t FW)\\nRO operator's revenue from gate fees, government incentives\\nand sales of recovered energy or materials (£/t FW).The operating costs comprise consumables, utilities, insurance, and\\nmaintenance:\\nCOC¼CConþCUþCIþCM £=tF WðÞ ð4Þ\\nwhere:\\nCCon cost of operating consumables (£/t FW)\\nCU cost of utilities (water and electricity) (£/t FW)\\nCI cost of insurance (£/t FW)\\nCM maintenance costs of the waste treatment facility (£/t FW).\\nTypically, no economic value is assigned to waste streams and there-\\nfore the value of the cost to the consumer (C C) is zero; however, the\\nshelf value of the avoidable fraction of food waste is considered in the\\nresults section to provide context. Labour costs are not considered, in\\ncongruence with the LCA methodology which does not consider the im-\\npacts associated with labour.\\n2.3. Inventory data and assumptions\\nThe primary inventory data have been obtained from operators of\\nthe treatment plants and supplemented from literature. Background\\nlife cycle inventory data have been sourced from the Ecoinvent database\\nV3.3 ( Ecoinvent, 2016 ). Further details on the data are provided below.\\n2.3.1. UK household food waste management\\nThe amounts of kerbside-collected FW treated by different disposal\\nmethods have been determined based on local authority data collated\\nin the database WasteDataFlow (2018) and annual reports produced\\nby the national governments of the UK; the results are summarised in\\nFig. 2 . Food waste disposed to the sewer, home-composted or fed to\\nlivestock is outside the scope of this study. For a full breakdown of all\\nhousehold waste, including FW, see Table S1 in the Supplementary in-\\nformation (SI).\\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2 , the majority of FW is embedded in MSW, of\\nwhich 1.65 Mt is land ﬁlled and 2.44 Mt incinerated annually. Approxi-\\nmately 29% of UK households have a separate food waste collection\\nand 20% have food waste collections co-mingled with green waste\\n(WRAP, 2016a ). In total, 0.51 Mt of FW are collected separately and\\n0.3 Mt are co-mingled with green waste. There are no de ﬁnitive ﬁgures\\nfor the ﬁnal treatment of these waste streams but they are split between\\nAD and IVC. For the separately-collected FW, it is assumed that 0.31 Mt\\nis sent to AD in accordance with estimates by Burns et al. (2017) . The re-\\nmaining 0.2 Mt of separately collected FW and all FW co-mingled within\\ngreen waste (0.3 Mt) are assumed to be treated at an IVC facility, as\\nwoody plant matter is not suited to AD. Thus, the total amount of FW\\ncollected by local authorities, either separately or co-mingled with\\nother waste is estimated at 4.9 Mt/year.\\n2.3.2. Food waste composition and value\\nThe composition of household FW is not homogenous and will vary\\nacross different locations and at different times of the year. A study in\\nWales ( Esteves and Devlin, 2010 ) took summer and winter samples\\nfrom 22 local authorities and analysed their elemental composition.\\nThe resulting average data are presented in Table S2 in the SI and are as-\\nsumed to be representative of UK household FW. All carbon is assumed\\nto be of biogenic origin. This composition has been used for incineration\\nand land ﬁll. However, for AD and IVC, it has not been possible to model\\nthe complex biological process for a speci ﬁc composition and, therefore,\\naverage composition values for food-derived biogas, digestate and com-\\npost have been used instead, as detailed further below.\\nTo estimate the implications of waste avoidance, two FW fractions\\nare considered: avoidable (suitable for human consumption) and po-\\ntentially avoidable (e.g. potato peel and bread crusts) waste. Their vol-\\numes have been estimated at 2.9 Mt/year and 0.8 Mt/year ( Quested\\nand Parry, 2017 ), respectively.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 for FW ( Quested et al., 2013a ) and hence it has only been possible to es-\\ntimate the global warming potential of avoiding these two FW fractions.\\nTheir shelf value (cost to consumer) has been determined using average\\ncost data from UK family food datasets ( DEFRA, 2017b ) and scaled up to\\nthe total household FW of 4.9 Mt/year ( Quested and Parry, 2017 ).\\n2.3.3. Waste collection\\nThe FW is collected by a conventional municipal waste lorry (21 t),\\nwhich has been modelled using Ecoinvent (2016) for an average dis-\\ntance of 20 km. Other distances (5 –30 km) are considered as part of\\nthe uncertainty analysis.\\nThe collection costs have been estimated using a local authority\\nkerbside costing tool ( WRAP, 2018 ). A sample of different local author-\\nities has been taken to represent a national average, with different costs\\nconsidered for urban, mixed urban/rural and rural populations, as well\\nas for different levels of economic deprivation. It has been assumed\\nthat there are fortnightly collections of residual waste and a weekly col-\\nlection of separated FW. The average costs for FW and MSW collections\\nhave been weighted based on the mix of household types in the UK\\n(Table S3).\\n2.3.4. Waste treatment\\nThe model for each treatment method is representative of the mix of\\nfacilities operating in the UK as discussed next. In the base case, the av-\\nerage values provided below have been used across the treatment op-\\ntions, with the minimum and maximum values considered in the\\nuncertainty analysis.\\n2.3.4.1. Anaerobic digestion. The life cycle of the AD system ( Fig. 3 a) com-\\nprises waste collection, construction and operation of AD and CHP\\nplants to generate respectively biogas and electricity, and application\\nof digestate to agricultural land. The excess electricity exported to grid\\nhas been assumed to displace UK grid electricity, for which the system\\nhas been credited. System credits have also been applied for the\\ndigestate which replaces an equivalent amount of mineral fertilisers.\\nThe heat is used to maintain the reactor temperature and to destroy\\npathogens in the digestate ( UK Government, 2014 ). As there is no mar-\\nket for excess heat from AD plants ( Scholes and Areikin, 2014 ), no\\ncredits have been applied for the heat.\\nThe inventory data, summarised in Table 1 , have been obtained from\\na number of operating and pilot scale plants within the EU. The average\\ndata have been used in the base case, with the minimum and maximum\\nvalues considered in the uncertainty analysis. Food waste is a compo-\\nnent of the feedstock at all plants but not the exclusive feed. The major-\\nity of AD plants in the UK have single-stage mesophilic (30 –40 °C)\\nreactors ( Scholes and Areikin, 2014 ). The representative plant used in\\nthis study has a capacity of 25,000 t/year over a 25 year lifespan and\\noperates using a high-solids 2500 m3single-stage mesophilic digester.\\nThe biogas is assumed to be 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide\\n(Ecoinvent, 2016 ). It is utilised in a 1 MW CHP reciprocating internal\\ncombustion engine to supply all on-site demand, with the excesselectricity exported to the grid. The CHP plant produces 277 kWh elec-\\ntricity and 476 kWh heat per tonne of FW.\\nMethane losses are assumed to be equivalent to 1% –3% of the total\\nbiogas produced ( Bernstad and la Cour Jansen, 2011 ;Evangelisti et al.,\\n2014 ;Naroznova et al., 2016 ). Both ammonia and nitrous oxide are gen-\\nerated during the AD, which are also considered ( Ecoinvent, 2016 ).\\nThe composition of the digestate (Table S4) is based on the analysis\\nof digestate from multiple UK AD plants processing FW ( Rigby and\\nSmith, 2011 ). As can be seen, the nutrient content of the digestate\\nranges widely, which has been explored in the uncertainty analysis.\\nThe quantities of fertilisers displaced by the digestate have been esti-\\nmated based on the mass of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Phos-\\nphorus and potassium have an equivalent uptake ef ﬁciency compared\\nto mineral fertiliser but the uptake of nitrogen ranges from 30% to\\n146% ( Bernstad and la Cour Jansen, 2011 ). In this work, the nitrogen up-\\ntake and emissions are based on UK ﬁeld results for the application of\\nfood-derived digestate, with the results shown in Table 1 (Nicholson\\net al., 2016 ). The ammonia and nitrate emissions that would occur fol-\\nlowing the application of ammonium nitrate have been included in\\nthe credits applied for displacing the mineral fertiliser.\\nNicholson et al. (2016) found that the average nitrous oxide emis-\\nsions from digestate application ranged from 0.2% to 0.9% of the nitro-\\ngen applied. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\\nassume a default value of 1% for all nitrogen fertilisers ( De Klein et al.,\\n2006 ), while Harty et al. (2016) have found nitrous oxide emissions\\nfrom application of calcium ammonium nitrate to range from 0.6% to\\n3.8%. While these results show that it is likely that nitrous oxide emis-\\nsions from digestate are lower than those of ammonium nitrate, due\\nto the uncertainty, they have been modelled as equal and no credit\\nhas been applied.\\nAn overview of the LCC data for AD is provided in Table 2 . The capital\\ncosts of the AD plant have been estimated based on BEIS (2017b) .G e n -\\neral AD plant maintenance has been assumed to cost 2% of the capital\\ncost and maintenance of the CHP unit is estimated at 1 p/kWh e(The\\nAndersons Centre, 2010 ). AD plants are eligible to receive incentives\\nfor the heat and electricity they produce. A feed-in tariff is paid for all\\nelectricity generated, including the amount used on site. An additional\\nexport tariff is paid for the electricity supplied to the grid ( Ofgem,\\n2018 ). As mentioned earlier, no heat is exported and hence no revenue\\nis considered.\\nBased on the available data, the median gate fee paid by local author-\\nities to dispose of waste at AD plants is £29 ( WRAP, 2017a ). The demand\\nfor digestate is low and, on average, AD operators pay a small fee for it to\\nbe removed.\\n2.3.4.2. In-vessel composting. Fig. 3 b provides an overview of the life cycle\\nof the IVC system considered in this study. Following collection, the FW\\nenters the air-controlled facility via an airlock and is stored before being\\nshredded and fed to the process vessels ( Eades et al., 2011 ). The\\ncomposting takes place under aerobic conditions, in horizontal rotating\\nsteel drums, with a retention time of four days.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 IVC system has been credited for displacing an equivalent amount of\\nmineral fertilisers. The latter is shown in Table 3 , alongside other inven-\\ntory data. The average values have been used in the base case, and the\\nminimum and maximum values in the uncertainty analysis.\\nThe data for composting facility are based on an IVC facility in Leom-\\ninster, UK ( Eades et al., 2011 ). However, as this facility has a relatively\\nhigh electricity consumption per tonne of waste, an average electricity\\nconsumption from several plants has been used instead. The capacity\\nhas been assumed at 50,000 t of FW per year, based on the capacity of\\nUK plants ( Letsrecycle, 2010, 2015, 2018, 2009, 2006 ). The assumed\\nlifespan of the plant is 25 years.\\nEmissions data for the IVC facility, windrow maturation and compost\\napplication have been sourced from literature ( Table 3 ). The air from\\nthe controlled facility is treated ﬁrst in a sulphuric-acid scrubber to con-\\ntrol emissions of ammonia and then in sodium-hydroxide scrubber to\\nremove hydrogen sulphide. Finally, the gases are passed through abioﬁlter, which contains bark, woodchip and shells, to oxidise odorous\\ncompounds. A small quantity of nitrous oxide is emitted to the air\\nfrom the IVC bio ﬁlter. During the maturation process, ammonia, meth-\\nane and non-methane volatile organic compounds are released to theair (Table 3 ). Emissions of biogenic carbon dioxide from the breakdown\\nof organic matter have not been considered, in congruence with com-\\nmon LCA practice.\\nIn the absence of speci ﬁc data for FW compost, the composition of\\nthe matured compost has been assumed equal to a UK average for\\nmixed green waste and food compost ( Bhogal et al., 2016 ); see\\nTable S5 in the SI for details. The software tool MANNER-NPK ( ADAS,\\n2013 ) has been used to determine the amount of mineral fertilisers\\ndisplaced and the emissions released from the use of food-derived com-\\npost. The emissions that would otherwise have occurred from mineral\\nfertilisers have been accounted for as discussed previously for the AD\\nsystem. A range of displacement and emissions values have been deter-\\nmined for nitrogen fertiliser, dependent on the soil type (clay or sandy)\\nand whether the compost is incorporated into the soil ( Table 3 ). Analo-\\ngous to digestate application, it has been assumed that there are no\\nequivalent variations for phosphorus and potassium. The gaseous emis-\\nsions of nitrous oxide following the application of compost do not signif-\\nicantly differ from the application of ammonium nitrate ( Nicholson\\net al., 2017 ); therefore, neither a credit nor an impact has been\\nconsidered.\\nThe data for LCC can be found in Table 4 . Accounting for in ﬂation\\n(Bank of England, 2018 ), the capital cost per tonne of annual capacity\\nhas decreased from around £150 in the late 2000s to about £90 in\\n2018 ( Letsrecycle, 2018, 2015, 2010, 2009, 2006 ;MRWA, 2010 ). Conse-\\nquently, a value of £100 per tonne of annual capacity has been assumed,\\nwhich equates to an overall capital cost of £5 m for the capacity of\\n50,000 t/year in Table 4 . Maintenance costs have been assumed to be\\n3% of the capital costs, in accordance with common engineering practice\\n(Towler and Sinnott, 2013 ). Electricity is the major operating expense\\nand it has been costed based on prices for a medium business ( BEIS,\\n2017c ). The cost of steam for pasteurisation, supplied by a gas boiler,\\nis based on the UK average prices in 2016/2017 for non-household use\\nwith annual consumption under 1000 GJ ( Eurostat, 2018 ).\\nThe median gate fee paid by local authorities to dispose of waste at\\nIVC plants is £46 ( WRAP, 2017a ). Compost is sold to agricultural users\\nat a mean price of £0.75/t (\\nHorne et al., 2013 ).\\n2.3.4.3. Incineration with energy recovery.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 are used to generate steam, which then drives a turbine to produce\\npower. The system has been credited for the latter, assuming the dis-placement of an equivalent amount of grid electricity. Based on cur-\\nrently operating UK facilities, the assumed capacity of the plant is\\n300,000 t of waste per year ( Environment Agency, 2016 ) and a lifespan\\nis 25 years.\\nTheﬂy ash is removed from the ﬂue gas by an electrostatic precipi-\\ntator, while acid gases, heavy metals and particulates are treated in a\\nmultistage wet scrubber ( Doka, 2009 ). The scrubber ef ﬂuents are\\nneutralised with hydrochloric acid and solids precipitated with iron\\nchloride, before being sent for wastewater treatment. Nitrogen oxides\\nare removed in selective non-catalytic reduction unit using ammonia.\\nThe treated ﬂue gas contains predominantly carbon dioxide, nitrogen,\\nwater and trace amounts of other gases. These are detailed in Table 5 ,\\ntogether with other inventory data.\\nThe bottom ash has been assumed to be land ﬁlled ( Doka, 2009 ). Al-\\nthough it can be used as aggregate, since the major solid components of\\nFW are combustible and FW contains negligible amounts of non-organic\\ncomponents, its contribution to the bottom ash is negligible. Therefore,\\nthe credits have not been considered for its potential use in the con-\\nstruction sector. The same applies for credits for any recyclables sepa-\\nrated out of the MSW.\\nAs the FW is incinerated together with the rest of the MSW, the elec-\\ntricity produced by the incineration plant has to be allocated between\\nthem. Lower heating value (LHV) has been used for this purpose, with\\nthe value of 3.8 MJ/kg used for FW ( LoRe and Harder, 2012 ;Roberts,\\n2015 ) and 8.9 MJ/kg for MSW ( Environment Agency, 2016 ). Therefore,\\nbased on the average electricity generated from MSW incineration of\\n597 kWh/t ( Environment Agency, 2016 ), the average electricity output\\nper tonne of FW is 255 kWh, with a range of 172 –338 kWh/t. The on-site\\nuse of electricity averages 81 kWh/t (48 –179 kWh/t) and imported\\nelectricity averages 6 kWh/t; both these values have been assumed to\\nbe independent of waste composition.\\nThe incineration system has been simulated using an Ecoinvent in-\\ncineration tool ( Ecoinvent, 2008 ), taking into account the speci ﬁcF W\\ncomposition considered here and the electricity outputs from operating\\nplants in the UK. As the only output is electricity, the uncertainty analy-\\nsis is limited to the amount of electricity produced and the amount of\\nelectricity consumed on site ( Table 5 ).\\nData used for the estimation of the LCC are summarised in Table 6 .\\nThe capital costs of the incineration facility of £213 m are based on\\nrecently-installed UK plants, with an average cost of £710 per tonne of\\nannual capacity ( Ryan, 2013 ;Amec Foster Wheeler, 2015 ;Green\\nInvestment Group, 2016 ). The capital costs have been allocated to FW\\nby assuming equal share of capital costs for all waste treated, which\\nequates to £28/t for a £213 m facility treating 300,000 t per year over\\na 25 year lifespan. The operating costs have been estimated using a cost-\\ning model from an engineering contractor ( Amec Foster Wheeler,\\n2015 ). The sale of electricity to the grid may be agreed within speci ﬁc\\ncontracts but for this study it is assumed to be similar to the export tariff\\nset by government ( Ofgem, 2018 ). The median gate fee paid by localauthorities to dispose of waste at incineration plants is £83 (\\nWRAP,\\n2017a ).\\n2.3.4.4. Land ﬁlling with energy recovery. The food waste is disposed of at a\\nsanitary land ﬁll, which is a contained system where land ﬁll gas (LFG) is\\ncollected and utilised for energy generation and leachate is collected fortreatment ( Fig. 3 d). The capture of LFG is required in the UK to reduce\\nmethane emissions from land ﬁlls (Environment Agency, 2009 ).\\nThe inventory data for land ﬁlling are summarised in Table 7 .T h e s e\\nhave been modelled through the Ecoinvent tool for sanitary MSW land-\\nﬁlls (Ecoinvent, 2008 ). The tool enables specifying waste composition,\\nenabling estimation of the impacts associated exclusively with the FW\\ncomponent of MSW. The model assumes 27% degradation of the carbon\\nin FW over 100 years, with the remaining matter held within the land ﬁll\\n(Doka, 2009 ). The land ﬁll covers an area of 90,000 m\\n2and is 20 m deep.\\nThe leachate is sent via sewer to a municipal wastewater treatment\\nplant and the resulting sludge is incinerated. The LFG capture rate\\nfrom large modern land ﬁll sites in the UK has been estimated at 68%,\\nof which 9.1% is ﬂared ( Gregory et al., 2014 ). UK land ﬁll plants use a\\ngas engine to generate electricity and heat is not recovered due to a\\nlack of infrastructure. The average gross engine ef ﬁciency is 40% with\\nthe net ef ﬁciency of 36% after the subtraction of the parasitic loads\\n(Gregory et al., 2014 ). At the average capture rate, this equates to\\n61 kWh electricity exported per tonne of FW sent to land ﬁll.\\nThe uncertainty analysis focuses on the amount of LFG captured\\n(55% to 85%) as this determines the direct methane emissions and the\\namount of electricity generated.\\nAn overview of the life cycle costs of land ﬁlling in the UK is given in\\nTable 8 . Capital costs of land ﬁll facilities are not available in the public\\ndomain. However, as land ﬁlls tend to be extended continuously over\\ntheir lifetime, capital costs of a land ﬁll extension have been used in-\\nstead, assuming a capacity of 175,000 t/year and a lifespan of the exten-\\nsion of 10 years ( Hogg, 2002 ). The capital costs have been allocated to\\nFW following the same approach as for incineration: all waste is as-\\nsumed to carry an equal burden of the capital cost, equating to £12/t\\nFW for the £21.7 m extension ( Table 8 ). The costs have been adjusted\\nfor in ﬂation to their current value ( Bank of England, 2018 ). The gener-\\nated electricity has been assumed to be sold to the grid at the export tar-\\niff set by government. The median gate fee paid by local authorities todispose of waste at land ﬁll is £107, including £84.40 land ﬁll tax\\n(WRAP, 2017a ).\\n2.3.5. UK grid electricity\\nThe 2017 UK electricity grid mix has been used to estimate the envi-\\nronmental impacts of the supplied and displaced electricity, with the\\ngeneration mix shown in Fig. S1 in the SI. The individual electricity tech-\\nnologies have been modelled using inventory data from Ecoinvent\\n(2016) . The estimated environmental impacts of the grid mix can be\\nfound in Table S6 in the SI.\\nTable 4\\nLife cycle costs of the treatment of household food waste via in-vessel composting.\\nIn-vessel composting costs Unit Amount Reference\\nCapital (overnight) costs £ m 5 Letsrecycle (2018, 2015, 2010, 2009, 2006) ;MRWA (2010)\\nOperating costs\\nMaintenance % of capital 3 Towler and Sinnott (2013)\\nElectricity import price £/kWh e 0.0973 BEIS (2017c)\\nNatural gas for steam £/kWh th 0.039 Eurostat (2018)\\nRed diesel for telehandler £/L 0.503 Statista (2018)\\nSulphuric acid £/t 49 ICIS (2017)\\nSodium hydroxide £/t 341 S&P Global Platts (2016)\\nDisposal costs\\nGate fees £/t FW 46 WRAP (2017a)\\nRevenue\\nCompost £/t compost 0.75 Horne et al.

Results and discussion\\nThe results are ﬁrst presented for the functional unit of 1 t of house-\\nhold FW treated, starting with the environmental impacts and followed\\nby the life cycle costs. The environmental and economic implications of\\nmanaging household FW at the UK level are discussed in Section 3.3 .\\n3.1. Life cycle environmental impacts\\nThe environmental impacts of the four waste management routes\\nfor the treatment of 1 t of food waste are presented in Fig. 4 and\\nTable S7 in the SI. The results refer to the average, minimum and maxi-\\nmum inventory values in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7 . The minimum and maxi-\\nmum values have been used in the uncertainty analysis to estimate the\\n90th and 10th percentile values of the impacts, shown as error bars in\\nFig. 4 .\\nAs can be inferred from Fig. 4 , in the average case, anaerobic diges-\\ntion has the lowest impacts for 13 out of 19 categories, including global\\nwarming potential. Incineration has the best values for marine eutro-\\nphication and agricultural land occupation, and land ﬁll for terrestrial\\nacidiﬁcation, particulate matter formation and natural land transforma-\\ntion. In-vessel composting is overall the worst option, with 12 impacts\\nbeing higher than for any other method. However, its urban landoccupation is the lowest among the alternatives considered. Land ﬁlling\\nleads to the highest global warming potential, alongside human toxicity,\\nmarine eutrophication and urban land occupation. Incineration is the\\nleast preferred method for metal depletion, freshwater eutrophication\\nand particulate matter formation. These results are discussed in more\\ndetail in the following sections.\\n3.1.1. Primary energy demand (PED)\\nFor the average case, AD has a net-negative PED of −1.93 GJ/t FW.\\nThis is primarily attributable to the grid electricity displaced but also\\nto the avoided production of mineral fertilisers. Incineration with en-\\nergy also has a net-negative PED ( −0.9 GJ/t FW) for the average case,\\nbut this is highly dependent on the ef ﬁciency of energy recovery and\\nparasitic use. For example, in the 90th percentile case, the electricity\\nfrom FW cannot cover the parasitic load and the system becomes a\\nnet user of energy (0.07 GJ/t FW). The modest recovery of energy\\nfrom the land ﬁll gas is not suf ﬁcient to exceed the energy demand of\\nthe land ﬁll process and, in the average case, it is a net consumer with\\na PED of 0.14 GJ/t FW. In the 10th percentile case, where land ﬁll gas cap-\\nture rate approaches the upper range of 85%, the process becomes a net\\nsaver of PED at −0.15 GJ/t FW. IVC has the highest PED, with 1.31 GJ/t\\nFW in the average case and ranging from 0.82 to 1.99 GJ/t FW. This is\\ndue to the energy-intensive air handling system required for theTable 5\\nInventory data for the treatment of household food waste via incineration with energy recovery.\\nParameter Unit Average Min.

Furthermore, the system credits for displacing\\nthe production of mineral fertilisers are small, as only a total of 19 kg\\nof mineral fertilisers are avoided through the composting of 1 t of FW.\\n3.1.2. Global warming potential (GWP)\\nAD has a net-saving in GHG emissions of −31.6 kg CO 2-eq./t FW due\\nto the displacement of grid electricity. Incineration with energy recov-\\nery has the second lowest GWP at −5k gC O 2eq./t FW. However, in\\nthe worst case, where the electricity generated is near the lower limit\\nand the on-site demand is near the upper limit, incineration has the po-\\ntential to become a net contributor to the GWP (31 kg CO 2eq./t FW for\\nthe 90th percentile). It should be noted that these results correspond to\\nFW incineration alone, not taking into account the energy recovered\\nfrom other MSW fractions, so that the overall GWP from incineration\\nis still likely to be net-negative ( Jeswani and Azapagic, 2016 ).\\nThe high PED of in-vessel composting leads to a GWP of\\n77.5 kg CO 2eq./t FW. This is attributable to the electricity use\\n(34 kg CO 2eq.) and FW transportation (26 kg CO 2eq.) but also emis-\\nsions of nitrous oxide and methane from process gases and windrow\\nmaturation (15.4 kg CO 2eq.). Some studies ( Smith et al., 1997 ;\\nFavoino and Hogg, 2008 ) have suggested that the application of com-\\npost to agricultural land can sequester carbon in the soil over long\\ntime periods, particularly depleted soils, and therefore has a potential\\nfor carbon mitigation. There is currently no de ﬁned methodology to\\nquantify this effect and hence it cannot be incorporated into these re-\\nsults. However, this should be borne in mind when interpreting the\\nGWP of composting.\\nLandﬁll has the highest GWP (195 kg CO 2eq.), predominantly due to\\nthe untreated emissions of methane: in the average case, 32% of LFG is\\nnot captured ( Section 2.3.4.4 ), approximately 50% of which is methane.\\nLandﬁll remains the worst option, followed by IVC, across the range of\\nvalues considered in the uncertainty analysis. In the best case, incinera-\\ntion is comparable to the average GWP of AD and vice versa: in the\\nworst case, the impact from AD is similar to the average GWP of incin-\\neration ( Fig. 4 ).\\n3.1.3. Fossil depletion (FD) and metal depletion (MD)\\nThe ranking of the waste treatment options for FD correlates with\\nthe amount of electricity generated and displaced from the grid, with\\nAD being the best option ( −19.8 kg oil eq./t FW), followed by incinera-\\ntion (−5 kg oil eq.) and land ﬁll (8.3 kg oil eq.). At 20.3 kg oil eq./t FW,\\nIVC has the highest FD as it recovers no energy. The wastetransportation (8.8 kg oil eq./t FW) is the largest contributor (59% –\\n83%) to FD for AD, incineration and land ﬁll, while for IVC, it is the use\\nof grid electricity (9.9 kg oil eq./t FW). In both the worst and best\\ncases, AD and IVC have the lowest and highest FD, respectively. In the\\nworst case, incineration has a similar impact as land ﬁll for the average\\ncase ( Fig. 4 ).\\nThe MD is predominantly related to the construction and operation\\nof the facilities, as well as transportation. The incineration plant is the\\nmost process- and equipment-intensive facility and this is re ﬂected in\\nthe highest impact of 1.6 kg Fe eq./t FW. IVC is the second worst option\\nfor MD (0.73 kg Fe eq./t FW), primarily due to the construction of the fa-\\ncility (0.8 kg Fe eq.) and grid electricity infrastructure (0.4 kg Fe eq.).\\nThe displacement of mineral fertilisers provides a total credit to the\\nIVC system of 1.1 kg Fe eq./t FW. The land ﬁll facility itself has the lowest\\nMD but, with the credits applied, AD emerges as the best option overall\\nMD (−1 kg Fe eq./t FW). There is no change in the treatment rankings\\nacross the range of impact values.\\n3.1.4. Freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity (FET, MET and TET)\\nand human toxicity (HT)\\nThe ecotoxicities and HT all follow the same trend, with AD having\\nthe lowest impacts, followed by incineration and land ﬁll. An exception\\nis HT of land ﬁll which is the highest across the options considered. For\\nthis impact, IVC is the second best option after AD, as it bene ﬁts from\\nthe credit for displacing phosphate fertiliser ( −8.8 kg 1,4-DB eq./t\\nFW). However, IVC has the greatest impacts for all three ecotoxicities.\\nThese trends are aligned with the electricity use/generation and the re-\\nlated credits. For all four toxicities, AD remains the preferred option in\\nboth the best and worst cases. In the worst case, incineration is compa-\\nrable to the average FET and MET of land ﬁll and has higher TET and HT\\nthan the averages for both land ﬁll and IVC ( Fig. 4 ).\\n3.1.5. Freshwater and marine eutrophication (FE and ME)\\nIncineration has the highest FE at 4.8 g P eq./t FW, due to the phos-\\nphates in the ﬂy ash which are emitted to freshwater following both\\nwastewater treatment and its land ﬁlling. The impact from land ﬁlling\\nis lower at 2.8 g P eq./t. The credits for mineral fertilisers cancel out\\nthe impact from electricity used for IVC, resulting in a net-negative FE\\nof−0.9 g P eq./t FW. Nevertheless, AD is the best option, saving\\n−11.6 g P eq./t FW, as the electricity and fertiliser credits exceed the\\nprocess emissions. Across the range of values used in the uncertainty\\nanalysis, AD remains the lowest-impact option. In the worst case, IVCapproaches the average. The average FE of land ﬁll is comparable to\\nthe worst-case impact of IVC and best-case impact from incineration.\\nLandﬁlling has the highest ME (7.4 kg N eq./t FW) due to the emis-\\nsions of ammonia and nitrate from leachates. This is more than ten\\ntimes greater than the impact of AD (0.7 kg N eq./t FW), the second\\nworst option. The majority of the ME from AD derives from ammonia\\nemissions following the application of digestate in agriculture. How-\\never, due to the uncertainty in these emissions, the 10th percentile\\ncase has a net saving of −0.03 kg N eq./t FW. The overall ME for IVC is\\nestimated at 0.4 kg N eq./t FW. Although some ammonia is removed\\nwithin the controlled atmosphere at the IVC facility and the ﬁnalTable 7\\nInventory data for land ﬁlling of household food waste with energy recovery.\\nParameter Unit Average Min.

Terrestrial acidi ﬁcation (TA) and particulate matter formation (PMF)\\nTA is high for both IVC (10.1 kg SO 2eq./t FW) and AD\\n(7.6 kg SO 2eq./t FW), with the signi ﬁcant contributory factor being\\nthe ammonia released to the air during compost maturation and\\ndigestate application, respectively. The small quantities of nitrogen ox-\\nides and sulphur dioxide emitted from incineration result in\\n0.4 kg SO 2eq./t FW, compared to 0.2 kg SO 2eq./t FW for land ﬁll,\\nwhich has limited ammonia emissions to air.\\nPMF follows the same trend as TA, with the impact primarily depen-\\ndent on nitrogen species emitted to the air. Incineration has the lowest\\nPMF at 0.18 kg PM 10eq./t FW, followed by land ﬁlling with\\n0.11 kg PM 10eq. The impact from AD is nearly ten times higher\\n(1.00 kg PM 10eq.) than from land ﬁlling, and that from IVC nearly\\neight times greater than from incineration (1.38 kg PM 10eq.).\\nThe uncertainty analysis for both TA and PMF shows the same\\ntrends, with AD and IVC having comparable impacts in the worst case\\nbut IVC being a better option than AD in the best case. The latter is pri-\\nmarily due to the lower value of ammonia volatilisation during wind-\\nrow maturation.\\n3.1.7. Photochemical oxidants formation (POF)\\nAlthough treated before release, the nitrogen oxides and non-\\nmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in ﬂue gases from incin-\\neration result in this option having the highest average POF (summer\\nsmog) of 0.85 kg NMVOC eq./t FW. The electricity use and NMVOC\\nfrom the composting process place IVC as the second worst alternative\\nfor this impact (0.66 kg NMVOC/t FW). Emissions of nitrogen oxides\\nand methane are the main cause of POF from the land ﬁll system, esti-\\nmated at 0.45 kg NMVOC eq./t FW. Other than minor combustion emis-\\nsions from the biogas utilisation, the POF of AD is caused bytransportation (0.17 kg NMVOC eq./t FW) which is the best option for\\nthis impact category.\\nConsidering the results of the uncertainty analysis, in the worst case,\\nthe POF of IVC is similar to the average impact of incineration and vice\\nversa: the POF of incineration in the best case is comparable to the aver-\\nage value for IVC ( Fig. 4 ).\\n3.1.8. Ozone depletion (OD)\\nThe OD is in ﬂuenced by the electricity credits, with AD having the\\nnet-negative impact of −4.6 mg CFC-11 eq./t FW. Incineration is ranked\\nsecond best with 0.5 mg CFC-11 eq./t FW. Land ﬁll and IVC have a much\\nhigher impact at 5.4 and 8.8 mg CFC-11 eq./t FW, respectively. For all\\ntreatment routes, the OD is predominantly due to the emissions from\\nthe waste collection and transportation (4.7 mg CFC-11 eq./t FW). The\\ntrends in the OD estimated in the uncertainty analysis ( Fig. 4 )r eﬂect\\nthe ranges of electricity used or credited: in the best case, the OD of\\nIVC is similar to the average value for land ﬁll and in the worst case,\\nthe impact of incineration is comparable to the average for land ﬁll.\\n3.1.9. Agricultural and urban land occupation (ALO and ULO) and natural\\nland transformation (NLT)\\nThe IVC and AD facilities have been assumed to occupy agricultural,\\nand land ﬁll and incineration urban land. The AD plant has a small land\\nfootprint as all processing is enclosed in vessels, whereas the matura-\\ntion of composting typically occurs in large windrows, requiring more\\nland. However, it is the electricity used in IVC that results in this option\\nhaving the highest ALO of 4.1 m2year/t FW.\\nLandﬁlling is the only treatment with a signi ﬁcant ULO\\n(3.9 m2year/t FW). However, land ﬁlls are reclaimed for natural land\\nat the end of their lives ( DEFRA, 2004 ). Therefore, with the related\\ncredit, the land ﬁll system has a net-negative NLT of −0.04 m2/t FW, ren-\\ndering it the best option for this impact.\\nThere are no changes in the rankings of the treatment options when\\nconsidering the range of values. For NLT in the best case, both IVC and\\nincineration are comparable to the average NLT of AD and, in the-50-40-30-20-100102030\\nPED x 0.1\\n[GJ]GWP x 10\\n[kg CO\\neq.]FD\\n[kg oil eq.]MD x 0.1\\n[kg Fe eq.]FET x 0.1\\n[kg 1,4-DB\\neq.]MET x 0.1\\n[kg 1,4-DB\\neq.]TET\\n[g 1,4-DB\\neq.]HT\\n[kg 1,4-DB\\neq.]FE\\n[g P eq.]ME\\n[kg N eq.]TA \\n[kg SO\\neq.]PMF x 0.1\\n[kg PM\\neq.]POF x 0.1\\n[kg\\nNMVOCOD\\n[mg CFC-\\n11 eq.] ALO\\n[m²yr]ULO\\n[m²yr]NLT x 0.01\\n[m²]IR x 10\\n[kg U235\\neq.]WD x 10\\n[m³]Anaerobic digestion In-vessel composting Incineration Landfill\\nFig. 4.

Ionising radiation (IR) and water depletion (WD)\\nNone of the treatment plants requires large amounts of water or\\ncause any direct ionising radiation. Therefore, the ranking of the options\\nfor these two impacts is directly correlated with the electricity used and\\ncredited for each treatment process. Consequently, in the average case,\\nAD is the best and IVC the worst option for both impacts. Considering\\nthe worst case, incineration is comparable to the average impacts of\\nlandﬁlling. For the best case, there is no change to the trend found for\\nthe average case.\\n3.1.11. Sensitivity analysis: electricity source\\nAs the above results suggest, many impact categories are in ﬂuenced\\nsigniﬁcantly by the use of grid electricity and the credits for its displace-\\nment, which are in turn determined by the electricity mix considered.\\nTherefore, this section explores the effect on the impacts of assuming\\nthe use and displacement of the following alternative electricity\\nsources: a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) powered by natural gas,\\nonshore wind turbines and a solar photovoltaics installed on the\\nground. CCGT has been chosen as currently the most prevalent electric-\\nity source in the UK ( BEIS, 2018 ). Furthermore, both solar and wind are\\nbecoming more important in the UK market and either could be\\ninstalled at an IVC facility. All three options have been modelled using\\nEcoinvent (2016) data and the results are compared with the grid elec-\\ntricity in Fig. 5 and Table S8, considering the average case for all the elec-\\ntricity sources. Land ﬁll is omitted as it is the least dependent on the\\nelectricity supply. For clarity and brevity, only selective impacts are\\nshown, exhibiting differing trends.\\nThe signi ﬁcant differences between CCGT and the UK grid are higher\\nFD and lower MD, HT, FE and OD for CCGT. However, the ranking of the\\ntreatment options remains the same, regardless of whether the systems\\nhave been credited for grid or CCGT electricity (Table S8).\\nIf AD and incineration are credited with displacing wind or solar en-\\nergy, then both treatment options become net contributors to GWP and\\nFD as the credits are lower compared to those for the grid electricity. On\\nthe other hand, the impact from IVC is reduced on the base case with\\nthese two renewable energy sources. For wind power, the three treat-\\nment methods converge in terms of GWP, with AD at 48.1 kg CO 2eq./t\\nFW, incineration at 47.6 kg CO 2eq., and IVC at 48.3 kg CO 2eq.\\nSolar PV, and to a lesser extent wind, is associated with greater MD\\nand toxicity impacts; therefore, their use instead of grid electricity ben-\\neﬁts AD and disadvantages IVC. By contrast, ME, TA and PMF are pre-\\ndominantly dependent on direct process emissions and are not\\nsigniﬁcantly affected by the source of electricity.\\nWhile it is not realistic to assume the electricity credits would solely\\nconsist of wind or solar energy, this analysis demonstrates that the en-\\nvironmental bene ﬁts of AD are highly dependent on system credits. IVC\\nis equally disadvantaged by considering only grid electricity, while solar\\npanels or a wind turbine could be installed on site to cover the electricity\\ndemands and thus improve on their environmental impacts.\\n3.1.12. Comparison of results with literature\\nAs mentioned in the introduction, four other LCA studies of house-\\nhold food waste management have been found in the literature. How-\\never, only three presented the results in a way that could be\\ncompared to the results in the current work: one for Ireland ( Oldﬁeld\\net al., 2016 ), another for a London borough ( Evangelisti et al., 2014 )\\nand the third for Seoul ( Lee et al., 2007 ). As all three used the CML\\n2001 method ( Guinée, 2002 ) to estimate the impacts, to enable com-\\nparisons, the results in the current study have been recalculated using\\nthe same method. All three studies considered GWP, acidi ﬁcation po-\\ntential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP), as discussed below.\\nThe GWP values are compared in Fig. 6 . Although the absolute values\\ndiffer, the same overall trend can be observed across all the studies, withlandﬁll having the highest impact, followed by composting and inciner-\\nation. AD was the best option in all studies in which it was included.\\nThe higher GWP values for land ﬁll found by Oldﬁeld et al. (2016)\\nandEvangelisti et al. (2014) are due to the assumptions regarding emis-\\nsions of LFG. Both studies assumed that 50% of LFG was emitted to the\\natmosphere, compared to 32% in this study. Furthermore, Oldﬁeld\\net al. (2016) did not consider utilisation of the LFG for energy recovery.\\nThe high GWP for the IVC in this study is attributable to the electricity\\nrequired to maintain a controlled atmosphere in the facility, whereas\\nneither of the compared studies mentioned any signi ﬁcant electricity\\nusage at the plant. Furthermore, the GWP of both incineration and AD\\nis dominated by the credits for the displaced grid electricity and all\\nthree studies in the literature assumed electricity mixes with a higher\\nshare of coal power; thus, they had higher credits than in this study.\\nFor the AP, the impact from incineration and land ﬁll is similar to that\\nreported in the literature ( Fig. 7 a). While both Oldﬁeld et al. (2016) and\\nLee et al. (2007) also found composting to have the highest AP, the im-\\npact estimated in the current study is more than four times greater. Sim-\\nilarly, the AP of AD is far greater in this study than in the literature. This\\nis due to different assumptions for the emissions of ammonia from both\\ndigestate and compost. In this study, these are based on large-scale UK\\nﬁeld tests whereas Evangelisti et al. (2014) used lower values derived\\nfrom a theoretical model; Oldﬁeld et al. (2016) did not state any emis-\\nsion values. If the lower values from UK ﬁeld tests are used instead of\\nthe average, the AP of AD reduces from 5 to 2.2 kg SO 2eq./t FW but is\\nstill signi ﬁcantly greater than the literature values ( Fig. 7 ). Further dif-\\nferences in the results can be attributed to the electricity credits –the\\nmuch lower share of coal in the current study means lower credits for\\nthe displaced electricity compared to the literature. Coal power has a\\nhigh AP compared to the grid average ( Stamford and Azapagic, 2012 ),\\nwhich helps to explain why the AP in the other two studies is net-\\nnegative.\\nFor the EP, both incineration and AD fall within the ranges of the\\nother studies ( Fig. 7 b). However, the impact of the other two treatment\\noptions is much higher in this study. For the land ﬁll system, both\\nOldﬁeld et al. (2016) andEvangelisti et al. (2014) used GaBi to deter-\\nmine the impact, which leads to a much lower estimate than the\\nEcoinvent model used in this study. The larger EP of IVC obtained in\\nthis study is attributable to the greater electricity consumption associ-\\nated with the controlled-atmosphere facility and ammonia emissionsfrom the open-air windrow maturation.\\nBernstad and la Cour Jansen (2011) also considered AD, IVC and in-\\ncineration, focusing on Sweden; however, they did not present the re-\\nsults in a format that can be directly compared to the results in this\\nwork. Nevertheless, they found that both AD and IVC had a net saving\\nin GWP, while incineration had a slightly net-positive impact, mainly at-\\ntributable to the life cycle of the plastic bags used to collect waste –a\\nfactor not considered in this study. The nutrient enrichment (NE) and\\nAP were comparatively very high for IVC and NE was also high for the\\ndigestate applied to clay soils. This mirrors the high EP and AP found\\nin this paper with regards to applying processed organic waste in\\nagriculture.\\n3.2. Life cycle costs\\nThe LCC of treating a tonne of FW by each of the four methods are\\npresented in Fig. 8 . These have been estimated assuming that the\\n4.9 Mt of household FW collected by local authorities annually is treated\\nas described in Section 2.3.1 . As can be seen in the ﬁgure, incineration\\nhas the lowest costs estimated at £71 per tonne of FW, followed by\\nIVC with £80/t FW. Land ﬁlling is the most expensive option, costing\\n£123/t while the cost of AD is £110/t. Collection of FW is the main con-\\ntributor to the total costs of AD and IVC; gate fees dominate for the other\\ntwo methods. These costs are discussed in more detail below, broken\\ndown into the costs to the local authorities responsible for the waste11 P.C. Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 collections and the facility operators treating the waste. All the costs\\nhave been rounded to the nearest pound.\\n3.2.1. Costs to local authorities\\nThese comprise costs of collecting the FW and gate fees paid to the\\noperator of treatment facilities (Eq. (2)). Overall, incineration has the\\nlowest cost to local authorities at £108/t, followed closely by IVC at\\n£109/t. The cost for AD and land ﬁlling are signi ﬁcantly higher at £137/\\nt and £132/t, respectively.\\n3.2.1.1. Collection costs. The costs of collecting FW separately from the\\nrest of MSW are lower per household (£7) compared to residual\\nwaste (£14) as the food collections require a smaller collection vehicle\\n(WRAP, 2008 ). However, as the total amount of FW collected per house-\\nhold is much lower than of residual MSW, the collection costs are far\\ngreater per tonne of FW. With the current amounts of FW collected\\n(Section 2.3.1 ), separate FW collection is estimated here to cost £108/t\\nwhile collecting mixed food and garden waste costs £63/t. Based on\\nthe 14.8 Mt of household MSW collected for incineration or land ﬁll(see Table S1 in the SI), the current collection cost of FW within MSW\\nis £25/t.\\n3.2.1.2. Gate fees. As shown in Fig. 8 (and speci ﬁed previously in\\nSection 2.3 ), the gate fees for the different treatment options vary signif-\\nicantly. Land ﬁll is the most expensive route at £107/t FW; however, £84\\nof this is land ﬁll tax, with the average gate fee received by the operator\\nof £23/t. The tax has increased year-on-year since its introduction in\\n1996, with the intention of reducing the amount of waste sent to land ﬁll\\nin compliance with the EU Land ﬁll Directive ( EC, 1999 ). The gate fees for\\nincineration are set below that of land ﬁll, at an average of £83/t FW, tak-\\ning into account the difference in fees for facilities with contracts agreed\\nbefore 2000 (£56/t FW), and those with contracts agreed subsequently\\n(£91/t).\\nThe average gate fees for IVC are £46/t FW and for AD £29/t. The AD\\nfacilities can afford to charge the lowest gate fees as signi ﬁcant revenue\\nto the operator may be attained from the electricity generated from the\\nbiogas and associated incentives. Despite the lower gate fees, AD is not\\ncompetitive with incineration for local authorities due to the higher\\ncosts of separate collection of FW. However, if local authorities can max-\\nimise the separate collection they can reduce collection costs per tonne.\\n-40-30-20-1001020\\nPED x 0.1\\n[GJ]GWP x 10\\n[kg CO eq.]FD\\n[kg oil eq.]MD x 0.1\\n[kg Fe eq.]HT\\n[kg 1,4-DB eq.]FE\\n[g P eq.]ME\\n[kg N eq.]TA \\n[kg SO eq.]PMF x 0.1\\n[kg PM eq.]POF x 0.1\\n[kg NMVOCOD\\n[mg CFC-11AD - UK grid AD - Natural gas AD - Wind AD - Solar PV\\nIVC - UK grid IVC - Natural gas IVC - Wind IVC - Solar PV\\nIncineration - UK grid Incineration - Natural gas Incineration - Wind Incineration - Solar PV\\nFig. 5.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 3.2.2. Costs to operators\\nOperators bear the costs of constructing and operating treatment fa-\\ncilities, which are offset through the gate fees they receive from local au-\\nthorities, any government incentives and sales of recovered energy and/\\nor materials (Eq. (3)). As a result, operators make a pro ﬁt across the\\ntreatment options, which is the highest for incineration (£37/t FW),\\nfollowed by IVC (£29/t), AD (£27/t) and ﬁnally land ﬁlling (£8). These\\nare detailed below.\\n3.2.2.1. Capital and operating costs. Despite having the highest capacity to\\ntreat waste, the incineration plant has the highest (overnight) capital\\ncosts at £28/t FW due to the large amount and scale of process equip-\\nment required. The capital costs of the AD and IVC facilities are £7/t\\nFW and £4/t FW, respectively. Both plants only require a simple agitated\\nprocessing vessel with the addition of a gas collection and CHP system\\nfor the AD plant. Land ﬁll has a capital cost of £12/t FW and requires\\nthe largest land area, land preparation and investment in the vehicles,\\nbut only limited process equipment is needed for the gas engine and\\nleachate treatment.\\nThe incineration plant also attracts the highest operating costs of\\n£26/t FW, largely due to the costs of disposing the bottom and ﬂy\\nashes, and maintenance, but also due to the consumables needed to\\ntreat the ﬂue gas and the resulting wastewater. The operating costs of\\nAD (£8/t FW) are limited to the maintenance and replacement of the\\nparts as the electricity and heat demand are supplied internally. IVC\\nhas higher operating costs (£14/t FW), of which more than half is re-\\nlated to the electricity costs (£9/t FW). Land ﬁlling is the cheapest to op-\\nerate at £5/t FW. This is due to limited waste processing and large\\nquantities of waste, leading to low per-tonne costs.3.2.2.2. Revenue. The revenue for all operators predominantly consists of\\nthe gate fees received from the local authority. The incineration facility\\nbrings in £8/t FW for the electricity it exports, which represents 9% of\\ntheir revenue. Hence, incineration creates the most revenue for the op-\\nerators compared to the other three options. Land ﬁll generates £3/t FW\\nrevenue from the sale of electricity, or 12% of the total revenue. The in-\\ncome for IVC from selling compost is negligible at 0.5% of the total rev-\\nenue. AD is the only treatment option that brings a signi ﬁcant product\\nrevenue; the generation of electricity attracts a tariff equal to £4/t FW\\nwhile the electricity exported to grid brings in an additional £13/t FW.On average, the digestate has no market value and the operators must\\npay users to take it away at a rate equivalent to £4/t FW. With incen-\\ntives, the revenue from AD products makes up 35% of total revenue\\nand 31% without incentives.\\n3.2.3. Overall environmental and economic sustainability\\nIntegrating the environmental impacts and economic costs, different\\ntreatment options are compared in Fig. 9 a to identify the most sustain-\\nable alternative. Assuming equal importance of all environmental im-\\npacts and LCC, it can be seen that incineration is ranked the best and\\nlandﬁll the worst option. Although AD has 13 lowest impacts, it has\\nthe third highest costs, which places it overall the second in the ranking\\norder. By contrast, IVC has the highest impacts but the second best LCC,\\nwhich puts it in the third place. Therefore, neither AD nor IVC emerge as\\nthe most sustainable options per tonne of waste treated, contrary to\\nbeing promoted as sustainable options in the context of a circular\\neconomy.a) Acidification potential b) Eutrophication potential5.0\\n6.7\\n0.3\\n0.4-0.09\\n1.5\\n0.3\\n0.05-0.07\\n0.09\\n0.641.3\\n0.11\\n-0.05-101234567\\nAnaerobic\\ndigestionIn-vessel\\ncompostingIncineration LandfillOSgk(PA ₂ )WFt/.qe\\n1.2\\n1.5\\n0.3\\n5.2-0.003\\n0.3\\n0.08\\n1.32.5\\n0.5\\n2.30.2\\n0.03\\n0.02\\n-10123456\\nAnaerobic\\ndigestionIn-vessel\\ncompostingIncineration LandfillEP (kg Phosphate eq./t FW)\\nFig. 7.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 3.3. Environmental impacts and costs at the UK level\\nThis section presents the environmental impacts and costs of\\ntreating 4.9 Mt/year of FW collected by local authorities from house-\\nholds, separately from other MSW. These have been estimated by scal-\\ning up the impacts and costs of the individual treatment processes on\\na per-tonne basis, discussed in the previous sections, and taking into ac-count the annual amounts of FW treated by each method (see\\nSection 2.3.1 ). The results are discussed below.\\n3.3.1. Life cycle environmental impacts\\nAs indicated in Fig. 10 , the current FW treatment system is estimated\\nto be a net energy producer with a primary energy demand of −1.93 PJ/-\\nyear. IVC is the main energy consumer (0.65 PJ) as it is the only treat-\\nment process that produces no electricity; land ﬁlling also has a net-\\npositive consumption of energy (0.23 PJ) due to waste transportation\\nand fuel needed for land ﬁll machinery. The saving in PED does not\\ntranslate to a saving in GWP, which amounts to 0.34 Mt CO\\n2eq. This\\nrepresents 0.07% of total UK emissions ( BEIS, 2017a ). The emissions of\\nmethane from land ﬁlls are the largest contributor (95%) to the total\\nGWP.\\nIncineration treats the greatest share of FW (49.7%) and has the\\ngreatest in ﬂuence on seven of the other impacts, resulting in net savings\\nin FET, MET, IR and WD related to the displaced electricity. However, it is\\nalso the highest contributors to MD, FE and POF, with the ﬁrst due to\\nconstruction materials and operating consumables, and the last two\\ndue to emissions from waste combustion. Land ﬁll has the second largest\\nshare of FW treated (33.7%). As a result, it has the greatest contributions\\nto ME, OD, TET, FD and ULO but leads to net savings in NLT due to land\\nrestoration at the end of life. IVC and AD have small treatment shares\\n(10.1% and 6.4%) but the biggest in ﬂuence on TA and PMF due to ammo-\\nnia released from digestate application and compost maturation.\\nFor context, the results for the current situation are compared with a\\nhypothetical case whereby all FW is assumed to be treated exclusively\\nvia AD, IVC, incineration or land ﬁll. The FW collections remain the\\nsame as for the current situation, with the waste treated via AD col-\\nlected separately and that treated via IVC mixed with garden waste;\\nfor incineration and land ﬁlling, the waste is collected co-mingled with\\nthe rest of the MSW.The results in Table S9 in the SI suggest that treating all the FW via\\nAD or incineration would each result in savings across 15 of the impacts\\ncompared to the current situation, with AD having the highest savings\\nin 13 categories. However, in the case of AD, acidi ﬁcation would in-\\ncrease by a factor of four and particulates by a factor of three. For incin-\\neration, summer smog would be higher by 30% and metal depletion by\\n56%. Treating FW exclusively via IVC or land ﬁlling would lead to savings\\nin ten and ﬁve impacts, respectively, compared to the current situation.\\nHowever, avoiding waste would lead to far greater savings in envi-\\nronmental impacts than the treatment by any of the methods. Focusing\\non GWP (due to a lack of data for the other impacts), the results of this\\nwork suggest that avoiding 2.9 Mt/year of avoidable and 0.8 Mt/year of\\npotentially avoidable fractions would save 14.09 Mt CO 2eq./year. This is\\nbased on the estimated GWP of avoidable and potentially avoidable\\nwaste of 3.74 t CO 2eq./t FW ( Quested et al., 2013a ), equivalent to the\\ntotal of 13.84 Mt CO 2eq./year. Adding to this 0.26 Mt CO 2eq./year gen-\\nerated during the treatment of this waste (based on\\n0.34 Mt CO 2eq./year for 4.9 Mt FW ( Fig. 10 ), scaled down to\\n3.7 Mt/year of avoidable waste) yields the total of\\n14.09 Mt CO 2eq./year avoided annually by not generating this amount\\nof waste. This is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the saving\\nof 0.15 Mt CO 2eq./year in the best treatment case when all FW is treated\\nvia AD. Thus, in the food sector, the UK has a far greater opportunity to\\nmeet carbon reduction targets by preventing food waste than by chang-\\ning treatment methods.\\n3.3.2. Life cycle costs\\nThe estimated annual LCC of treating FW are summarised in Fig. 11\\nfor the current situation. For context, an analysis similar to that for the\\nenvironmental impacts in the previous section has also been performed\\nfor the LCC, considering the exclusive treatment of the waste by one of\\nthe four treatment methods. Given the assumption that the\\n4.9 Mt/year of household FW managed by local authorities is treated ex-\\nclusively by each management route, the increase in FW collected sep-\\narately or with garden waste reduces the collection costs per tonnecompared to the current costs. AD requires separate food waste collec-\\ntions, with the provision extended to all UK households and all FW col-\\nlected the collection costs have been estimated to reduce from the\\ncurrent value of £108/t to £39/t. For exclusive treatment via IVC, it has\\nbeen assumed all food waste is collected co-mingled with garden\\n    a) Comparison per tonne of food waste treated     b) Comparison with current situation for the total annual \\n                food waste treated (4.9 Mt/yr) Indicator Anaerobic \\ndigestionIn-vessel \\ncompostingIncineration Landfill Indicator Current \\nsitua tion Anaerobic \\ndigestionIn-vessel \\ncompostingIncineration Landfill\\nP E D 1423 P E D 3 1 5 24\\nG W P 1324 G W P 3 1 4 25\\nF D  1 4 2 3 F D  31 52 4\\nM D  1 3 4 2 M D  41 35 2F E T 1 4 2 3 F E T 31 52 4M E T 1 4 2 3 M E T 31 52 4T E T 1 4 2 3 T E T 31 52 4\\nH T  1324 H T  3 1 4 25\\nF E  1 2 4 3 F E  31 25 4M E 3214 M E 4 3 2 15T A  3421 T A  3 4 5 21P M F 3421 P M F 3 4 5 21P O F 1 3 4 2 P O F 31 45 2O D  1 4 2 3 O D  31 52 4\\nA L O 2 4 1 3 A L O 23 51 4\\nU L O 2134 U L O 4 2 1 35\\nN L T 2431 N L T 2 3 5 41\\nI R  1423 I R  3 1 5 24\\nW D  1423 W D  3 1 5 24Avg. env. score 1.5 3.4 2.3 2.8 Avg. env. score 3.1 1.7 4.2 2.5 3.5\\nLCC 3 2 1 4 LCC 4 1 2 3 5\\nTotal score 4.5 5.4 3.3 6.8 Total score 7.1 2.7 6.2 5.5 8.5\\nO v e r a l l  r a n k i n g 2314 O v e r a l l  r a n k i n g 4 1 3 25\\nL e g e n d 1234 L e g e n d 1 2 3 45\\ntsroW tseB tsroW tseB\\nFig. 9.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 waste; the increased collection of food waste has been estimated to re-\\nduce the current cost of £63/t to £40/t.\\nAs can be seen, the total costs of FW treatment amounts to\\n£452 m/year, including the operators' revenue of £302 m/year. Local au-\\nthorities spend in total £579 m/year, or which £168 m/year is for waste\\ncollection and the rest for gate fees.\\nIf instead all the FW was sent to AD, this would lead to the greatest\\nannual LCC savings of £251 m compared to the current situation. This\\nis followed by IVC with a saving of £172 m/year. AD would also lead\\nto the lowest costs of £334 m/year for local authorities, a 42% reduction\\non the current costs of £579 m/year. Land ﬁlling is the most expensive\\noption overall (£604 m/year), followed by incineration (£349 m/year).\\nThis is in contrast with the trends seen for treatment routes with the\\ncurrent collections rates (see Fig. 8 ): if all FW can be collected either\\nseparately or co-mingled with garden waste, the collection costs fall suf-\\nﬁciently for both AD and IVC to have lower LCC than incineration.Considering the avoidable FW, the results shows that the avoidable\\nFW fraction collected by local authorities (2.9 Mt/year) has an annual\\nshelf value of £9.71 bn and the potentially avoidable fraction\\n(0.8 Mt/year) a value of £1 bn. No value is assigned to the unavoidable\\nfraction. Therefore, the total LCC of managing 4.9 Mt/year of household\\nFW are approximately 4% of the £10.71 bn shelf value of the avoidable\\nand potentially avoidable FW. Hence, avoiding waste would achieve\\nfar greater cost savings (43 times) than the maximum saving potential\\nof £251 m/year that could be attained by treating all the FW via AD.\\n3.3.3.

Slorach et al. / Science of the Total Environment 693 (2019) 133516 of FW treated annually. Contrary to the ﬁndings per tonne of FW\\ntreated, AD emerges as the best treatment option, while incineration\\nis now ranked the second; IVC and land ﬁll keep their previous rankings\\n(Fig. 9 b). The reason for this change in rankings is the LCC: while the LCA\\nimpacts exhibit the same trends as the per-tonne rankings shown in\\nFig. 9 a, the LCC of AD and IVC are reduced signi ﬁcantly (by 64% and\\n35%) with higher volumes of waste they treat due to the economies ofscale. However, it should be stressed that this increase in the volume\\nof waste treated should only be at the expense of the volume treated\\nby incineration and land ﬁlling, rather than an absolute increase in the\\namount of FW.\\nIt can also be seen from Fig. 9 b that all options but land ﬁlling are\\nmore sustainable than the current mix of treatment options, which is\\nranked fourth.\\nTherefore, the ﬁndings of this paper support UK policy proposals to\\nmandate separate food collections from all households by 2023\\n(DEFRA, 2018b ) and treat that FW via anaerobic digestion, as recom-\\nmended by the National Infrastructure Commission (2018) . However,\\nas discussed earlier, much greater bene ﬁts would be achieved through\\nFW prevention.\\n4. Conclusion and recommendations\\nThis work has developed environmental and economic life cycle\\nmodels for the treatment of FW via anaerobic digestion, in-vessel\\ncomposting, incineration and land ﬁll to provide new insights into the\\nsustainability of FW management. The comparison of these treatment\\nmethods shows that, on average, anaerobic digestion has the lowest im-\\npacts for 13 out of 19 categories, including global warming potential.\\nThe latter is estimated to be net-negative at −32 kg CO\\n2eq./t FW. Incin-\\neration also has a net-negative GWP ( −5k gC O 2eq./t FW), along with\\nthe lowest marine eutrophication and agricultural land occupation,\\nbut it has the highest metal depletion, freshwater eutrophication and\\nparticulate matter formation. Land ﬁll has the greatest global warming\\npotential (195 kg CO 2eq./t FW), human toxicity, marine eutrophication\\nand urban land occupation but is the best option for terrestrial acidi ﬁca-\\ntion, particulate matter and natural land transformation. In-vessel\\ncomposting is overall the worst option, with 12 impacts being higher\\nthan for any other method. Therefore, although this option complies\\nwith the circular economy principles through the recycling of nutrients\\nback to the start of the food supply chain, it is otherwise environmen-\\ntally unsustainable. On the other hand, anaerobic digestion is both com-\\npliant with the circular economy principles and is also environmentally\\nthe most sustainable option.\\nAt current food waste collection rates in the UK, incineration has the\\nlowest life cycle costs of £71/t FW, attributable to the revenue from elec-\\ntricity generation and the lowest collection costs. It also offers the oper-\\nators the highest pro ﬁts in spite of the highest operating and capital\\ncosts; this is primarily due to a high gate fee. Despite making negligible\\nrevenue from compost, in-vessel composting has the second lowest LCC\\n(£80/t FW), largely due to the lowest capital costs. Anaerobic digestion\\nhas the second highest overall costs (£110/t FW), attributable to the\\nhigh collection costs per tonne of the relatively small share of FW cur-\\nrently collected separately. Without the land ﬁll tax, land ﬁlling has the\\nlowest LCC of £39/t FW, but with the tax, it becomes the most expensive\\ntreatment method at £123/t FW.\\nTreating the total of 4.9 Mt of food waste collected annually from\\nhouseholds by local authorities costs £452 m and generates\\n0.34 Mt CO 2eq. However, the treatment system is a net provider of elec-\\ntricity, saving 1.9 PJ of primary energy. Despite that, it is a net contribu-\\ntor across 12 of the 17 other environmental impacts considered,\\nincluding acidi ﬁcation, eutrophication, summer smog, ozone depletion\\nand particulate matter.\\nEnvironmentally, the best option would be to treat all the food waste\\nvia anaerobic digestion, which would provide savings across 15 of the\\n19 impacts compared to the current situation, including primary energydemand (7.55 PJ/year) and global warming potential (0.49 Mt CO 2eq./\\nyear). This would also lead to a cost saving of £251 m/year compared to\\nthe current situation. However, the environmental bene ﬁts of AD are\\nprimarily dependent on displacing the current grid electricity. With\\nthe increasing share of renewables in the mix, the relative advantage\\nof anaerobic digestion would decrease and in-vessel composting could\\nbecome more competitive.\\nAssuming equal importance of environmental impacts and costs, in-\\ncineration is the most sustainable option per tonne of waste treated. For\\nthe annual volume currently treated in the UK, anaerobic digestion\\nwould be more sustainable than incineration; in-vessel composting is\\nranked third in both cases. However, they are all more sustainable\\nthan the current mix of treatment technologies. Land ﬁlling is the least\\nsustainable option overall.\\nBased on these results, the separate collection of household food\\nwaste should be encouraged if it can be treated via anaerobic digestion.\\nHowever, if in-vessel composting remains the primary treatment route\\nfor separate collections, it would be more sustainable for the food waste\\nto be incinerated with general MSW. Therefore, the most realistic sce-\\nnario for improving the sustainability of household food waste is to con-\\ntinue to favour incineration over land ﬁll for MSW, while increasing and\\npromoting separate food waste collections for treatment via anaerobic\\ndigestion only. However, preventing avoidable food waste would\\nachieve far greater bene ﬁts, both economically and environmentally,\\nand should be favoured over any treatment option.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was carried out as part of the UK Centre for Sustainable\\nEnergy Use in Food Chains (CSEF), funded by the Research Councils\\nUK (EP/K011820/1).

End users or consumers are the starting point where e- \\nwaste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy (CE), such as repair, reuse, remanu -\\nfacturing, and recycling. E-waste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of e-waste with household \\nwaste by consumers. Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to \\nachieve CE. Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers ’ e-waste-related \\nknowledge and awareness, and behavior on consumption, disposal, storage, recycling, and repair. Substantial \\nknowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around e-waste may be integrated into \\nthe CE model. This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing 109 research papers published in international \\npeer-reviewed journals identified in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, using content analysis \\nmethodology to analyze and review the articles. The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a \\nmore consumer-centric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and \\nimplementation strategies around e-waste. This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer \\nbehavior around e-waste. The study results show that consumers ’ disposal and recycling behaviors are the two \\nmain areas of research interest in the studies reviewed. In contrast, reuse and repair behavior were investigated \\nto a lesser extent. In this study, several research gaps and areas for future research are identified, along with \\nsuggestions for a CE framework focusing on the e-waste sector that, encompasses policy initiatives and business \\nmodel innovations. The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are \\nstarting to work on consumer behavior-related e-waste research.   \\n1.Introduction \\nThe rapid technological revolution, coupled with increasing demand \\namong consumers for high-tech products, has triggered unprecedented \\nlevels of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) consumption. At this \\nmoment, there are approximately 900 different types of EEE found in the \\ninternational market (Forti et al., 2018 ). Electronic waste (e-waste) or \\nWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) that EEE becomes at \\nthe end of its useful life poses a severe challenge to the environment as well as to human health due to the presence of highly toxic substances \\n(Balde et al., 2017 ). E-waste management (EM) is one of the most \\npressing problems for today ’s modern society (Islam and Huda, 2019a ), \\nwith around 53.6 million tons of e-waste generated worldwide in 2019 \\nand levels escalating rapidly (Forti et al., 2020 ). \\nAside from reducing negative impacts, improved management of e- \\nwaste streams represents a lucrative opportunity due to the various \\nprecious and rare earth elements it contains (Shumon et al., 2014 ). The \\nstarting point for e-waste is consumers, who determine its destination. \\n*Corresponding author. \\n**Corresponding author.

(2019) identified that the consumer is one of the \\ncritical elements of the e-waste problem, with demand growth for EEE, \\nconsumers ’ environmental awareness, and behavior being key factors. \\nFrom the CE perspective, four different paths are associated with con-\\nsumers, which are (1) maintained/prolonged use, including sharing and \\nrepair; (2) reuse and distribution; (3) remanufacture/refurbishment; \\nand (4) recycling (Fig. 1). \\nCE is “an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by \\nintention and design ” (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2013 ). Reverse \\nsupply chain (RSC), product/service design, business models, EoL re-\\ncovery, product/service use, and policy are the CE’s building blocks \\n(Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015 ). According to Lieder and Rashid \\n(2016) , \"the definition is more comprehensive as it considers both the \\nenvironmental and economic advantages simultaneously under the \\nnotion of regenerative performance ” requiring novel business models \\nthat enable the high-quality circulation of technical material or nutrients \\nand safe entry of bio-nutrients or regenerated materials into the bio-\\nlogical sphere. Consumers, government, policymakers, charities, private \\nsector investors, digital disruptors (at a multinational or entrepreneurial \\nlevel), product manufacturers, parts manufacturers, service providers, \\nand stakeholders of recycling industries are the main actors in CE (Ellen \\nMacArthur Foundation, 2015 ). Fig. 2 shows related factors (central \\ninner circle) of a complex socio-economic system, and the building \\nblocks of a CE. According to Alamerew and Brissaud (2020) , the blocks \\nand factors interact in a relatively complicated manner, requiring an \\ninterdisciplinary approach to solve problems. In this case, information \\non legal, economic, social, business, and environmental aspects are \\nparticularly critical (Brissaud and Zwolinski, 2017 ). \\nIn 1990, e-waste was first considered as a priority waste stream in \\nEurope, and in 2002, the European Union (EU) WEEE Directive was \\npublished (Directive, 2012 ). Parajuly and Wenzel (2017) argued that the \\ne-waste stream possesses a high possibility for reuse and valuable ma-\\nterial recovery. The Directive imposes strict obligations on producers \\nregarding waste management under the Extended Producer Re-\\nsponsibility (EPR) system (Horta Arduin et al., 2019 ). More recently, the EU CE action plan works towards \"closing the loop\" of product lifecycles \\nthrough sustainable production and consumption and sound waste \\nmanagement (EU, 2019 ). Due to the diverse range of EEE products, the \\nEU categorized e-waste items into six different segments. Table 1 shows \\nthe categories, sample products, and legislative provisions of recovery, \\nreuse, and recycling for the member states. \\nIn recent times, research related to consumers ’ awareness of e-waste, \\nconsumption, storage, disposal, and recycling behavior has been gaining \\nFig. 1.E-waste, consumers and CE model, adapted from MacArthur (2013) and Parajuly et al.

Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n3attention among researchers worldwide. Broadly, consumer behavior \\nfocusing on e-waste can be categorized into several areas: consumption, \\nstorage, repair and reuse (R&R), disposal, and recycling (Bovea, M.D. \\net al., 2018 ). Knowledge and awareness about the formal collection \\nsystem among consumers are also critical aspects that determine the \\nsustainability of the system in the socio-economic sphere. Several \\nstudies, such as the study by Islam et al. (2020a) , Ramzan et al. (2019) , \\nSaphores et al. (2007) and others, emphasized the issue. E-waste-related \\npolicy, management system architecture, country-specific consumer \\nculture and behavior, and availability of a diverse range of product \\ncategories in the market and their interaction with consumers create a \\ncomplex phenomenon defining and connecting building blocks and \\ndefinitions of circular economy with a sustainable e-waste management \\nsystem. Literature related to the consumer behaviors around e-waste is \\nproliferating; however, no comprehensive review article is found that \\nanalyzed all the behaviors to spot the future research directions and \\ndeveloping a consumer-centric circular economy framework focusing on \\ne-waste. This paper tries to eliminate such gaps by reviewing 109 articles \\npublished between 2005 and March 2021 using content analysis meth -\\nodology. The main research questions (RQs) of the article are: \\nRQ 1: How do the issues related to consumer awareness and \\nbehavior with a particular focus on the e-waste sector contribute to the \\nessential operational framework in achieving a CE? \\nRQ 2: How can the general understanding contribute to informing \\npolicymakers and researchers in identifying future policy measures to be \\ntaken and the necessity of performing research studies in the area? \\nAfter reviewing articles published on consumer behavior around e- \\nwaste in Section 4, a consumer-centric CE framework is proposed with \\npolicy implications and business model innovation under Section 5. \\nWith this, RQ 1 was answered. Based on the in-depth literature review of \\nthe selected articles, research gaps were identified, proposing critical \\nfuture research directions in Section 5.3, by which RQ 2 was addressed. \\nThe research contributions of this review article are: (1) it provided a \\nguide or reference for future researchers to accumulate all the infor-\\nmation and knowledge surrounding consumer behavior-related topics \\nfocusing on e-waste; (2) it attempted to propose measures achieving a \\ncircular economy more holistically, from a framework perspective \\nfocusing on sustainable consumer behavior and e-waste. In many cases, \\npublished papers did not consider the CE concept into their central \\nresearch theme, focusing instead on various behavioral aspects. The \\nframework incorporated behavior-specific aspects into CE pathways, \\ncreating interdisciplinary research opportunities in the field; (3) besides, \\npresenting, a quantitative assessment of the research progress in the \\nfield, the article provided a transparent and replicable methodology, \\nwhich could also be utilized collecting materials from other available \\ndatabases; (4) in this paper issues related to policy and business model innovation are discussed, respectively, which provide suggestions for \\nboth researchers and policymakers in system-level development and \\nfuture research areas; and (5) on the research topic, potential future \\nresearch directions have been identified, which could be useful for \\nfuture researchers. \\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 dis-\\ncusses some earlier review articles. Section 3 describes the research \\nmethodology. An in-depth analysis of the literature is presented in \\nSection 4. Results and discussion are illustrated in Section 5. Finally, \\nSection 6 ends with the conclusion. \\n2.Literature review \\nTo clarify the need of this review article, some of the previously \\npublished review articles worth mentioning. Table 2 provides details of \\nthe previous articles on the topic which also helped to perform a \\nstructured literature review based on the content analysis methodology. \\nDetails of the methodology is described in Section 3. \\nBased on Table 2, it is evident that in recent time, no comprehensive \\nliterature review article has been published on all the consumers ’ \\nbehavioral aspects focusing on e-waste. Scopes of the articles also \\nshowed that consideration of various product types was not given in the \\nprevious review articles, and issues were discussed more in the local \\ncontext. Thus, a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding a \\nholistic picture of consumers ’ behavior around e-waste. This is the first \\nattempt at reviewing consumer awareness, and behavior focused on e- \\nwaste, considering all the behavioral aspects to the best of the authors ’ \\nknowledge. \\n3.Research methodology \\nAccording to Easterby-Smith et al. (2012) and Brocke et al. (2009) , a \\nliterature review plays a critical role in understanding and exploring a \\nspecific research field ’s structure. New theory development and inves -\\ntigation scope could further progress the knowledge base by identifying \\na useful literature review (Machi and McEvoy, 2016 ). In this study, the \\nfour-steps systematic literature review technique proposed by Mayring \\n(2001) under the qualitative content analysis method is utilized. Fig. 3 \\nshows the four steps process model for the content analysis method \\nconsisting of material collection, descriptive analysis, category selec-\\ntion, and material evaluation. Mayring (2014) provided an extensive \\ndiscussion on the method. Previously, several literature review articles \\nhave applied the research methodology to e-waste research (e.g., Wati \\nand Koo (2010) ; Islam and Huda (2018b) ; Islam and Huda (2019b) ; \\nIsmail and Hanafiah (2020) ; Ismail and Hanafiah (2019) ; P´erez-Belis \\net al.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n43.1. Material collection \\nTo collect relevant articles that focused only on consumer behavior \\naround e-waste, an extensive search was performed in the Web of Sci-\\nence (WoS) core collection database using “Advanced Search ” window. \\nThe following keywords were used, which were previously utilized by \\nIslam and Huda (2019a) : “TS =(“waste electrical and electronic equip -\\nment*\") OR TS =(“e-waste\") OR TS =(“E-waste\") OR TS =(“WEEE\") OR \\nTS =(“waste electronics*\") OR TS =(“waste-electronics*\") OR TS =\\n(“electronic scrap\") OR TS =(“electronics waste\") OR TS =(“obsolete \\nelectronics*\") OR TS =(“electronic-waste*\") OR TS =(“electronic waste\") \\nOR TS =(“electrical waste ”) OR TS =(“electrical wastes ”) OR TS =\\n(“electronic wastes\") OR TS =(“waste electrical\") OR TS =(“wastes elec-\\ntrical\") OR TS =(“waste electronic\") OR TS =(“wastes electronic\") OR TS \\n=(“electronic rubbish ”) OR TS =(“electronic garbage ”) OR TS =\\n(“electrical rubbish ”) OR TS =(“electrical garbage ”)”. \\nHere, TS refers to a topic utilized in the database. With these key-\\nwords, 4660 articles were found. In this stage, only \"articles\" (as a \\ndocument category) and published in the \"English\" language were \\nconsidered. Later, \"public\" OR \"consumer*\" OR \"consumers*\" OR \\n\"customer*\" OR \"household*\" OR \"resident*\" OR \"residents*\" keywords \\nwere input in the refine search box of the database that retrieved a total \\nof 907 articles. As the studies need to have a primary survey component \\nas part of the methodology, the keyword \"survey\" was used in the refined \\nsearch, which delivered 152 articles. The search was performed on 13 \\nNovember 2020. Other criteria for selecting the articles were that the \\nmethodology section of the article must specify the sample size, sam-\\npling technique, and the number of the valid samples (of the \\nparticipants). \\nIn some cases, a few studies identified through the search involved surveyed stakeholders other than consumers, such as repair technicians, \\nin the study by Sabbaghi et al. (2017) . These were excluded from the \\nselection, as the group does not represent consumers. Finally, 109 arti-\\ncles were found that focused only on consumers ’ behavior around \\ne-waste. The articles collected in the material-collection stage showed \\nthat authors had analyzed more than one issue in most cases. For \\nexample, P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) investigated the second-hand pur-\\nchase and repair behavior of consumers focusing on small IT equipment \\nin which they investigated consumption, R&R and disposal behavior \\naltogether. Table 3 shows the article selection process for this review \\narticle. \\n3.2. Descriptive analysis \\nThe following subsections illustrate the analysis result on distribu -\\ntion of the articles in various journal outlets, annual production of ar-\\nticles, subject categories of the articles, country-wise distribution of the \\narticles, electronic products focused on the papers, utilization of specific \\nresearch methodology/techniques in the articles and finally, data \\ncollection and analysis techniques implemented in the collection of \\narticles. \\n3.2.1. Journal-wise distribution \\nThe selected articles were published in thirty-six different journal \\noutlets. From Fig. 4, it is evident that most of the papers were published \\nin renowned journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production , Waste \\nManagement , Resources Conservation, and Recycling and Sustainability . \\nThe diversity of the journal outlets publishing papers on consumer \\nbehavior related to e-waste shows the necessity of a multidisciplinary \\napproach to analyzing specific behavior-related problems and solutions.

Distribution of research papers by subject/discipline \\nUsing the Web of Science (WoS) ’s “Results analysis tools, ” it was \\nfound that 39% of the articles fell under the subject category of envi-\\nronmental sciences, which was the most prominent subject category \\n(Fig. 6). Other categories included engineering (environmental) (26%), \\ngreen sustainable science technology (17%), environmental studies \\n(6%), regional urban planning (3%), and business (2%). These results \\nindicate that consumer behavior related to e-waste studies covers a \\ndiverse spectrum of discipline areas that demand an interdisciplinary study approach. \\n3.2.4. Country-wise article production \\nFig. 7 shows the geographical distribution of the studies, in terms of \\nthe number of publications focusing on a specific country. In the \\ncollection of the articles, first author ’s affiliation and country were \\nconsidered as the origin of the article. China, under the group of \\ndeveloping countries, produced the highest number of articles (26 pa-\\npers until November 2020), and this number is higher than the number \\nof papers published by some of the countries from developed nations \\nsuch as the USA (10 articles) and Spain (6 articles). Malaysia (5 papers), \\nIndia (9 papers), and Brazil (5 papers) were some of the other devel -\\noping countries in which consumers ’ behavior was studied. Even though \\ne-waste is a global environmental problem and consumer behavior is an \\nimportant factor for e-waste impacts, surprisingly, consumer behavior \\nwas studied in relatively few countries. For instance, from Australia, \\nthere are only two academic papers published on the issue in 2020. \\n3.2.5. Product diversity in papers \\nAs consumer behavior varies substantially according to the cate-\\ngories of the products and specific product use, Fig. 7(A) shows the di-\\nversity of the products discussed in the selected articles. MPs (over 45%) \\nwere the most widely discussed topic in the consumer behavior related \\ne-waste research (identified by analyzing the papers), followed by DCs \\n(over 25%) and liquid crystalline displays (LCDs) (25%).

SITTE (39%) products were most frequently \\nconsidered, followed by SE (29%). \\n3.2.6. Distribution of research papers by methodology \\nIn terms of research methodology (Fig. 9), the most frequent meth -\\nodology was statistical (57%), followed by theoretical (17%), analytical \\n(14%), survey (9%), and case study (3%). The categorization made in \\nthis study is based on the types and characteristics of the tools and \\ntechniques applied to explain consumer behavior towards e-waste. \\nWhen studies performed or applied specific statistical methods, tools, \\nand techniques, those studies were considered under the category of \\n\"statistical\". Specific methods and techniques categorized as statistical \\nmethodologies include Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), analysis of \\nvariance (ANOVA), Conjoint analysis, Correlation analysis, contingent \\nranking (CR) analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, Correspondence \\nanalysis, various regression models such as logistic regression, Multi -\\nnomial logistic regression (MLR), ordered logit regression model, \\nextended ordered probit model, Poisson regression model (count \\nmodel), generalized logistics regression, and hierarchical regression \\n(hierarchical moderated regression Analysis). Various tests such as the \\nChi-square test of independence, t-test, Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests, \\nKruskall-Wallis tests, Mann-Whitney test, the Wald-Wolfowitz test were \\nalso performed for the statistical analysis. \\nMethodologies categorized as “theoretical ” included those where, \\nauthors utilized various theoretical approaches to analyze problems \\nand/or to incorporate theories into real-world scenarios. The most \\ncommon approaches classed as theoretical were, Technology Accep -\\ntance Model (TAM), Fuzzy theory, Psychological needs theory (BPNT), \\nNorm-activation model (NAM) theory, Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, and Goal-framing theory. Methodologies classed as “analytical ” \\nincluded Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), Competing \\nrisks survival analysis (CR-SA) model, Principal Component Analysis \\n(PCA), Probabilistic approach, MICMAC (Matriced ’ Impacts Croise ’s \\nMultiplication Appliqu ´ee a UN Classement). \\nWhile all the papers selected for this review article involved survey \\nto some extent, studies were classified within the “survey ” category if \\nthey were performed using any market research methodology such as \\nthe Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), a survey-based economic \\ntechnique that was implemented mainly for assessing consumers ’ will-\\ningness to pay. This “survey ” category was created to separate these \\nresearch methodologies from others that were more statistical, theo-\\nretical, analytical, or case study focused. Approaches that fall under the \\n“case study ” category include quasi-ethnographic approaches, direct \\nwaste analysis, and word of mouth research methodologies. When cross- \\ncultural and cross-country studies were performed, then those were \\nconsidered as case studies. \\nTheory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is one of the dominant theories \\nused in the analysis technique coupled with structural equation \\nmodeling (SEM). SEM is a combined statistical technique consisting of \\nmultiple regression, path analysis, and factor analysis. Ajzen (1991) first \\npostulated the TPB, and later several extended versions of the theory \\nhave been implemented in marketing research. This evolved out of the \\n\"Theory of Reasoned Action,\" which states that intentions are the best \\npredictors of behaviors. The central premise of TPB is that something is \\nmore likely to be done if there is a plan to do it. According to TPB, in-\\ntentions are the product of three different processes, (1) behavioral at-\\ntitudes, (2) subjective norms, and (3) perceived behavioral control. \\nPapers that applied TPB, particularly in e-waste-related consumer \\nbehavior research, are presented in the Appendix in Table A2, and the \\nprimary constructs and their interrelations are shown in Fig. A1. \\nOverall, it was identified that a diverse range of tools, methods, and \\ntechniques have been applied, which indicates that these methods could \\nbe part of the “tools and techniques ” specific factor explaining the cir-\\ncular economy principles, at least in relation to consumer behaviors and \\nperspectives on e-waste. These results also showed that an interdisci -\\nplinary approach is required for proposing new solutions and/or theory \\ndevelopment in the research areas. \\n3.2.7. Primary data collection and analysis techniques \\nAs mentioned earlier, in the selection criteria of the papers to be \\nincluded in this article, a study must contain a survey component in its \\nresearch methodology. After analyzing the data collection technique \\n(DCT) of the papers (Fig. 10), it is found that face-to-face interviews \\n(FTFI) were implemented by 24% of the articles, followed by paper- \\nbased surveys (PBS) (22%) and online surveys (21%). Approximately \\n13% of the articles mentioned that a survey was performed; but did not \\nexplicitly mention any specific DCTs. In some cases, multiple DCTs were \\nalso observed; for instance, around 6% of the articles used both PBSs and \\nFTFIs. \\n3.3. Category selection \\nThe main categorization of the content of this article and the \\nresearch framework is presented in Fig. 11. As mentioned in the material \\ncollection section, the literature is classified into six major research \\ntypes/categories. These six categories are (1) knowledge, awareness, \\nand familiarity about formal e-waste collection and recycling systems; \\n(2) consumption behavior (CB); (3) storage behavior (SB); (4) R&R \\nbehavior; (5) disposal behavior (DB); and (5) recycling behavior (RB). \\nThe distribution of the research articles for six different categories is \\nshown in Fig. 12, with details of individual papers in Table S1 (in the SI). \\nDisposal behavior was most commonly-assessed (26% of the publica -\\ntions), followed by consumption behavior (20%) and knowledge and \\nawareness (19%). In contrast, recycling, storage, and repair/reuse \\nbehavior were less commonly studied, which illustrates the need for \\nFig. 6.Distribution of research papers by subject categories.  \\nFig. 7.Geographical distribution and number of articles published by \\nthe countries.

Material evaluation \\nUsing inductive and deductive approaches simultaneously, two re-\\nsearchers performed a validity test as the last part of the content analysis \\nprocess. The reliability of the content was measured by both intra-rater \\nreliability and inter-rater reliability. After the material collection, all \\nnecessary data have been extracted as per categories and subcategories \\nidentified by the researchers and input in a Microsoft Excel ™ spread -\\nsheet to avoid repetition error. In the WoS database, the same keywords \\nwere utilized to search articles, producing similar results with the cor-\\nrect articles. This is how reliability was established. Over time, a few \\narticles were added to the database. NVivo version 12 plus was utilized \\nin some places, identifying specific content and subsequent analysis and \\nfor cross-referencing purposes. This is how the validity of the content has \\nbeen achieved. 4.In-depth analysis of the literature \\nIn this section, multiple topics have been analyzed based on the \\ncollection of the articles. In section 4.1, articles that discussed con-\\nsumers ’ perceptions and understanding regarding e-waste and e-waste \\ncollection and recycling system were analyzed. In Section 4.2, various \\nconsumer behaviors were comprehensively analyzed. For example, in \\nSection 4.2.1 , consumption behavior related studies were highlighted, \\nwhile Section 4.2.3 and Section 4.2.4 disposal and repair and reuse- \\nrelated behavioral issues were compiled, respectively. Section 4.2.5 \\nwas dedicated to analyzing consumers ’ recycling behavior-related \\nstudies. The overall mapping of the sections and subsections of the \\nanalysis is shown in Fig. 13. \\n4.1. Consumers ’ knowledge and awareness regarding e-waste and \\nfamiliarity of collection and recycling system \\nResponse from the consumers regarding \"what e-waste is\" and \"the \\nnegative health impact of e-waste\" fell under the category of \"general \\nawareness,\" and these specific questions were investigated by around \\nFig. 8.Major e-waste considered in the papers (A) product (in %) and (B) category according to EU WEEE Directive (in %).

Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n819% of the articles. Rather than developed countries, this issue was \\nmainly highlighted in the articles published from the developing coun-\\ntries. Associated issues that come under the category of consumers ’ \\nknowledge and awareness are analyzed in the subsequent subsections. \\n4.1.1. Understanding and perceptions of e-waste \\nGenerally, mature adult consumers consider e-waste to create \\nnegative environmental impacts (Afroz et al., 2013 ). Similar result was \\nidentified by Siringo et al. (2020) and Tan et al. (2018) . Even young \\nconsumers in Australia had the same perception (Islam et al., 2020b ). \\nSame phenomenon was identified for the Chinese young people in the \\nstudy of Ramzan et al. (2019) . However, Borthakur and Govind (2019) \\nmentioned that level of awareness related to potential harmful impact of \\ne-waste on environment was found substantially low. Similar result was \\nshown research conducted by Awasthi and Li (2018) , Ravindra and Mor \\n(2019) and Saritha et al. (2015) . On the other hand, sometimes people \\ndo not consider e-waste as dangerous and toxic (Pandebesie et al., \\n2019 ). \\nLack of information related to e-waste was found to be one of the \\ncritical aspects that need to be disseminated (G¨ok et al., 2017 ), as often \\ne-waste recycling-related activities and consumers ’ role is unclear (understood as complicated and time-demanding task). This scenario \\nprevails both in developing and developed countries, for example, by \\nSaphores et al. (2012) in the USA, where the authors found that con-\\nsumers were unwilling to transfer the waste to proper recycling facil-\\nities. Limited e-waste toxicity knowledge often creates barriers adopting \\nenvironment-friendly products. Darby and Obara (2005) mentioned that \\nconsumers demanded more information on where they can recycle their \\nsmall WEEE instead why they should recycle. In an e-waste take-back \\nsystem, lack of awareness, insufficient information, and \\nsocio-demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) significantly affect con-\\nsumers ’ motivation to return e-waste (Botelho et al., 2016 ). \\nThere are also other behavioral factors associated with the motiva -\\ntion to adopt environment-friendly practices, and Siringo et al. (2020) \\nfound that moral norms, environmental beliefs, and social pressure \\nsignificantly affect performing (or willingness to perform) appropriate \\nactivities, such as recycling. Liu et al. (2019) even urged for a funda -\\nmental change in the environmental awareness and behavior. Environ -\\nmental beliefs largely influence willingness to pay (WTP) to develop a \\nsustainable EM system, even if recycling convenience is limited (Nixon \\net al., 2009 ). Nguyen et al. (2021) mentioned that end-user ’s willingness \\nto participate in recycling programs, laws and regulations, inconve -\\nnience of recycling, and experience were four key factors that indicated \\nWTP for e-waste recycling. Adequate environmental knowledge could \\nlead to stronger environmental belief, and Saphores et al. (2007) found \\nthat environmental knowledge was a significant predictor of WTP for \\nenvironmentally friendly products. Several authors suggested that con-\\nsumers ’ awareness-raising programs should be organized (Saritha et al., \\n2015 ). \\n4.1.2. Lack of e-waste-related awareness – the consequences \\nDue to lack of knowledge, informal sector collectors and recyclers \\ngot an advantage and became more influential. For example, Islam et al. \\n(2016) found that 30% of the households preferred to sell their e-waste \\nitems to local scrap collectors or even throwing e-waste with household \\nwaste. Pasiecznik et al. (2017) ’s study indicated that 12% of respondents \\n(mostly young consumers) did so as well. For a formal system (devel -\\noped and prepared as per environmental guidelines), ‘weak environ -\\nmental protection awareness ’ and limited knowledge of recycling \\nchannels results in a low collection rate, which is a loss in investment. \\nLow-level of awareness could also influence personal beliefs. For \\nexample, Fraige et al. (2012) found that 11% of consumers believed that \\nthey could dispose of WEEE with household waste. Product-specific \\nwaste collection, for instance, in the case of waste mobile phone \\n(WMP) recycling, low awareness levels, and inadequate recycling abil-\\nities were considered as main obstacles (Liu et al., 2019 ). \\nFurthermore, hibernating behavior (storing e-waste) could evolve \\ndue to little e-waste knowledge. Storing e-waste at home is a general \\npractice which is nothing but stockpiling material resources in the whole \\nsupply chain or the built environment (Borthakur and Govind, 2019 ). \\nBai et al. (2018) particularly mentioned that perception regarding \\nresource conservation effort (which was not well-recognized) needs to \\nbe more understood by the consumers. \\n4.1.3. Familiarity of collection and recycling programs \\nThe familiarity of the formal collection and recycling system (C&RS) \\nis critical for a system ’s overall long-term sustainability. Often such \\nawareness, especially location of the nearest e-waste collection points, \\nwas found limited (Cao et al., 2018 ). Similar result was found research \\nby Borthakur and Govind (2019) , Gu et al. (2017) and Ravindra and Mor \\n(2019) . Despite the presence of some level of e-waste-related knowledge \\namong consumers, sometimes, the awareness of the existence of any \\ne-waste recovery programs in a region or city was found limited. For \\nexample, Awasthi and Li (2018) found the issue for case of Bangalore, \\nIndia; Deng et al. (2017) for Hong Kong, China; and Islam et al. (2020b) \\nfor Sydney, Australia. Environmental consciousness among young uni-\\nversity students is expected to be higher than the general population, as \\nFig. 9.Distribution of research methodologies of the selected articles.  \\nFig. 10.Data collection techniques of the articles.

Islam et al.

Publicizing information regarding formal C&RSs \\nwas found to be critical in several studies (Cai et al., 2020 ). Similar \\nconclusion was found for South Korea by Park et al. (2019) , China by Yin \\net al. (2014) and Finland by Yl¨a-Mella et al. (2015) . On the other hand, \\nWang et al. (2018) disagreed with such argument for the residents of \\nShandong Province, China. Due to the lack of appropriate information \\nregarding collection points, Colesca et al. (2014) found that 43.48% of \\nthe respondents dispose of their e-waste via other pathways such as \\nlandfills. Information dissemination on the collection schedule was also \\ncritical (Nowakowski, 2016 ). Miner et al. (2020) mentioned that \\ncommunity-based interventions to improve awareness levels have \\nsignificance. \\nDagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) mentioned that despite self-reported aware -\\nness, consumers were not familiar with the various classifications of \\ne-waste (category of EEE) under the national EM of Lithuania. Among \\nthe various categories of e-waste, SE has a relatively shorter lifespan, \\nand Echegaray (2016) found that the products ’ expected lifespan decreases with the electronic device ’s portability. Cao et al. (2016) \\nconcluded that most consumers could not differentiate between formal \\nand informal sector e-waste collection channels. Chi et al. (2014) \\nmentioned that despite the higher economic benefits of old-for-new \\n(OFN) collection schemes, 60.7% of respondents in their survey did \\nnot know about the price differences with other collection channels. \\nMartinho et al. (2017) mentioned that environmental consciousness \\nexisted among Portuguese consumers, however, due to a lack of \\nknowledge about recycling campaigns/programs, such moderately \\nfamiliar aspects failed to capitalize on the higher collection and recy-\\ncling rate of waste tablets and MPs. \\n4.1.4. Impact of socio-economic factors on consumers ’ e-waste knowledge \\nand awareness \\nIn India, Singh et al. (2018) found that respondents with higher \\neducational qualifications had higher awareness about e-waste. Similar \\nresults were also found by Shaikh et al. (2020) in Pakistan. Nowakowski \\n(2019) identified the factor as influential in Poland. Islam et al. (2020a) \\nfound that age, household size, and income were significantly associated \\nwith recycling program familiarity, while Milovantseva and Saphores \\n(2013a) found gender and age. Regional distribution of EEE use and \\ngender are vital attributes to a successful e-waste management system \\n(EMS). Bhatt et al. (2017) found that most women from Delhi and \\nNOIDA were more cognizant of the environmental issues related to \\ne-waste. Miner et al. (2020) mentioned that respondents ’ \\nsocio-demographic characteristics had no significant influence on the \\nlevels of awareness, knowledge, and willingness to participate in the EM \\nprograms and extended producer responsibility schemes. \\n4.1.5. Awareness improvement techniques \\nArain et al. (2020) suggested that e-waste educational campaigns \\nshould inform consumers on what constitutes e-waste and why it is \\nessential to ensure proper recycling. Saphores et al. (2006) mentioned \\nthat providing education to young people and making e-waste sites \\nconvenient (similar to the curbside collection program for other recy-\\nclable products) for older people were crucial aspects of participants ’ \\nwillingness to recycle. Song et al. (2012) mentioned that despite general \\nFig. 11.Categorization and research framework of the studies.  \\nFig. 12.Distribution of research articles for different categories.  M.T.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n10hazard perceptions among consumers regarding e-waste, educational \\ncampaigns should be promulgated specifically for reuse and recycling. \\nEnvironmental protection and resource conservation-related education \\nshould be given at an early stage, creating recycling habits. \\nJafari et al. (2017) contend that the focus of awareness-raising \\ncampaigns should be on college students, higher-income households, \\nand married residents. Young consumers in a developing country, such \\nas China, believe that EM is a shared responsibility of different stake -\\nholders, including consumers, the government, manufacturers, and \\nsellers (Ramzan et al., 2019 ). Huang et al. (2006) also found that re-\\nspondents are willing to share environmental responsibilities around \\ne-waste in China and similar perceptions exist amongst Australian \\nconsumers (Islam et al., 2020b ). Kumar (2019) mentioned an opportu -\\nnity to influence and propagate pro-environment behavior amongst \\nyoung adults through university programs. Table S2 presented in the SI \\nshows various solution techniques proposed by the reviewed articles ’ \\nauthors improving consumer awareness. \\n4.2. Consumer behaviors \\nVarious consumers ’ behaviors were analyzed in the selected articles. \\nThe articles were categorized into five different consumer behavior \\ntypes, as shown in Fig. 11 (consumption, storage, disposal, repair/reuse \\nand recycling), which are discussed in the following sub-sections. \\n4.2.1. Analyzing consumers ’ consumption behavior \\n“Consumption behavior ” was one of the significant topical issues \\nresearched by over 20% of the selected articles. Measurements applied \\nto understand behavior included the number of appliances in house -\\nholds, average ownership of household appliances, average lifespan of \\nEEE, reasons for replacing EEE and, frequency of replacement. Factors \\naffecting consumption behavior are discussed below, including growing \\ndevice penetration rate, source of device acquisition, factors-related to purchase decision, device-specific product ownership, reasons and trend \\nof device replacement, and product lifespan. A detailed summary table \\nof the consumers ’ consumption-related studies is presented in Table S3 \\nin the article ’s SI. In the last column of the table (category), articles were \\nmapped according to their discussion area. \\n4.2.1.1. Growth of device penetration rate – the reasons. The consump -\\ntion of AC is influenced by climatic conditions to a greater degree than \\nother products such as PCs (including DCs and laptops), TV sets, re-\\nfrigerators, and WMs (Cai et al., 2020 ). Similar result was found by \\nChung et al. (2011) for Hong Kong and by Song et al. (2012) for Macau. \\nDuring the Christmas season, consumption of electrical and electronic \\ntoys increases (P´erez-Belis, V. et al., 2015 ). On the other hand, new \\ngovernment initiatives in ICT knowledge and skill dissemination pro-\\ngram showed a positive trend in higher device usage (Rodrigues et al., \\n2020 ). Rodrigues et al. (2020) also identified that the government \\nincentive program accelerated computers and printers ’ penetration rate \\nin Brazil. The major contributing factors to high penetration and \\nreplacement rates were “the rapid economic growth of a country ” (Bhatt \\net al., 2017 ), “the income of growing consumer segments, and the \\ncompetitive market for electronic products ” (Shaikh et al., 2020 ), \\n“affordable fast-pace technological innovation and price ” (Arain et al., \\n2020 ), “local manufacturing base ” (Afroz et al., 2012 ), “ever-increasing \\nconsumer demand ” (Cai et al., 2020 ), and “poor electronic repairability \\ncoupled with shorter product lifespan ” (Arain et al., 2020 ). High-tech \\ndevice penetration, such as PCs, now becomes an indicator of a city’s \\neconomic and cultural development (Li et al., 2012 ). Among large \\nequipment, the most consumed products are washing machines, air \\nconditioners and refrigerators (Cai et al., 2020 ). Chi et al. (2014) \\nmentioned that, except for mobile phones, per capita consumption for \\nlarge equipment was higher than small equipment such as camcorders \\nand printers. On the other hand, a high device replacement rate in-\\ndicates consumption patterns and future EG (Fraige et al., 2012 ). \\nFig. 13.Sections and subsections of in-depth literature review.  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n114.2.1.2. Factors-related to purchase decision. Consumers prefer to buy \\ncheap (nonbrand) electronics, despite a shorter lifespan (Othman et al., \\n2015 ). “Comparative price ” (G¨ok et al., 2017 ) and “warranty period, \\nbrands, and installment facilities ” (Islam et al., 2016 ) were also found as \\ncritical criteria during product purchase. Recommendations from \\nfriends and, store promotion were some of the motivating factors behind \\npurchasing decisions (Afroz et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, Huang \\net al. (2006) found that \"launching of new products with more powerful \\ndesigns and extended capacity\" and \"the increasing purchasing power\" \\nwere the main reasons for new product purchase. \\nSome studies introduced a hypothetical green product to assess \\nconsumers ’ WTP or willingness to buy (WTB). For example, both \\nNnorom et al. (2009) populated the concept of “green phones ” that do \\nnot contain any hazardous substances, and can be disposed of with \\nregular household solid waste. Similar research was conducted by \\nMilovantseva (2016) in the USA. The products ’ purchase and use in-\\ntentions were found to be positive, despite discrepancies about extra \\nmoney (Saphores et al., 2007 ). The primary enablers for green product \\npurchase and WTP for such products were “environmental attitude \\n(improving local environment) ” (Huang et al., 2006 ), “resource (money \\nor wealth) ” (Nnorom et al., 2009 ), “ease of use” (Nnorom et al., 2009 ), \\nand “product eco-labeling ” (Sheoran and Kumar, 2020 ). Milovantseva \\n(2016) found that consumers who had a positive attitude towards \\nrecycling small electronics had significant environmental beliefs. \\nImportance of environmental product labeling was critical especially, \\nfor informed decision-making of the consumers (Bovea, M. et al., 2018 ). \\nTu et al. (2018) found that brand recognition, service quality, usage \\nperiod, and perceived prices are the most significant characteristics of \\n“iPhone ” as a MP brand. For purchase motivation, “recognition ” and \\n“brand advantage ” were the factors. In contrast, “recognition, ” “brand \\nadvantage, ” and “service quality ” were essential factors for brand loy-\\nalty, and “perceived price ” was necessary for purchase intention. Au-\\nthors also found that female respondents were more inclined towards \\n“recognition, ” “brand advantage, ” and “perceived price ” than their male \\ncounterparts. Simultaneously, the level of income was the critical \\nsocio-economic variable for the factor “perceived price. ” The factor also \\ninfluenced the consumers ’ purchase intention. Bai et al. (2018) reported \\nthat consumers tended to purchase mobile phones more frequently, and \\nthe service life of mobile phones was decreasing dramatically, with \\nphones most commonly purchased brand new through official channels. \\nEchegaray (2016) and Li et al. (2012) showed variable ownership \\nlevels for different appliances, with MPs having the highest per-capita \\nconsumption and, DCs the lowest, for Brazil and China, respectively. \\nSimilarly, Araujo et al. (2017) observed that mobile phone ownership \\nwas higher than other LE such as WMs, ACs, and SE such as tablets and \\nDCs. In India, Borthakur and Govind (2019) that the number of the \\nout-of-use mobile phone was equal to or higher than the number of \\nin-use mobile phones. Bai et al. (2018) identified that more than two \\nMPs were possessed by the majority of the consumers in China. Martinho \\net al. (2017) identified that smartphone usage is higher than tablets in \\nPortugal. Consumers with high income and education tended to acquire \\nmore high-tech equipment, such as MPs, plasma TV sets, PCs, and ACs \\n(Cao et al., 2016 ). Similar trend was observed by Song et al. (2012) for \\nChina as well, and for Vietnam by Nguyen et al. (2009) . \\n4.2.1.3. General product-focused trend. Rodrigues et al. (2020) found \\nthat the device acquisition (possession) period was higher for white \\ngoods but smaller for SE and screen categories. Zhang, L. et al. (2019) \\nmentioned that product functionality is shifting towards more portable \\ndevices (e.g., DCs’ functions could be replaced by tablets and laptops \\nand digital cameras by mobile phone). A stationary device such as a PC \\nrequires fewer updates among the students. Borthakur and Govind \\n(2019) identified that between computers and MPs, the latter is replaced \\nmore frequently than the first one among the Indian consumers. For \\nexample, within 2–3 years, MPs were replaced, and for computers, it was every 3–4 years. Beyond four years, none of the devices were used. \\n4.2.1.4. Reasons for device replacement. The reasons for product \\nreplacement could be broadly categorized as malfunction, technological \\nobsolesce, and, demand for additional features (Sabbaghi and Behdad, \\n2018 ). Consumers ’ perceived obsolescence is characterized by physical \\nand technological obsolescence. The first two reasons were more evident \\nin European developed countries, and the last one is seen from the \\ndeveloping country ’s context. Furthermore, due to demand for addi-\\ntional features, the product itself became obsolete and in that case, \\nreplacing a new item was the only option that consumers had. Wieser \\nand Tr¨oger (2018) revealed that perceived obsolescence is the primary \\nmotivation for mobile phone replacements and the defective device was \\nthe main reason for replacement. Perceived obsoleteness was the main \\nreason for replacement rather than “desire for a new phone ”. Logics of \\ntechnological change and fashion were the determinants of replacement. \\nArticles discussing for product replacement identified multiple rea-\\nsons, which varied between products. The fast advancement of tech-\\nnology, function, and application availability was critical for MPs (Bai \\net al., 2018 ). Among the various reasons, “broken down ”/-\\nmalfunctioning device/damaged ” was found as the main reason for \\ndevice replacement regardless of the product types. Such trend was \\nobserved among consumers from different parts of the world. For \\nexample, in India by Borthakur and Singh (2020) ; in Australia by Islam \\net al. (2020a) and Islam et al. (2020b) ; in Portugal by Martinho et al. \\n(2017) ; in Nigeria by Miner et al. (2020) ; in UK by Ongondo and Wil-\\nliams (2011) ; in Spain by P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) ; in Brazil by Rodrigues \\net al. (2020) ; in Pakistan by Shaikh et al. (2020) ; finally, in China by Tan \\net al. (2018) and Yin et al. (2014) . Pandebesie et al. (2019) discovered \\nthat the unstable electrical voltage was the main reason for products \\nmalfunctioning in Indonesia. It is a common phenomenon in developing \\ncountries. \\nAmong the other (secondary) reasons, “lack of accessories of SE” \\n(P´erez-Belis et al., 2017 ), “upgrade from network operator ” (Martinho \\net al., 2017 ), “longer battery life” (Miner et al., 2020 ), “fashionable, \\nmusic storage, picture storage for MPs” (Ongondo and Williams, 2011 ), \\n“new system requirements by software applications for DCs” (Islam \\net al., 2016 ), “old design (not powerful/not enough capacity) ” (Afroz \\net al., 2012 ) and “backdated functionalities ” (Shaikh et al., 2020 ), \\n“stolen ” (Liu et al., 2019 ), “lost” (Tan et al., 2018 ), “completely \\ndestroyed ” (Tan et al., 2018 ), “service lifetime exceeded ” (Tan et al., \\n2018 ), “market introduction of newer designs ” (Miner et al., 2020 ), \\n“influences by others (e.g., through advertisement, friends and trend) ” \\n(Afroz et al., 2012 ) were found critical among consumes. Distribution of \\nthe reasons for replacement is shown in Fig. 14. \\nIn some studies, “fashion pursuit ” (Cao et al., 2016 ), and “additional \\nand more advance technological features ” (Afroz et al., 2012 ) were \\nselected as the main reason for device replacement. Borthakur and Singh \\n(2020) found that consumers tended to buy new phones even though \\ntheir old phone is still working. For mobile phones, “fashion (Yin et al., \\n2014 ) and “(social) status ” (Shaikh et al., 2020 ) were found as the two \\ncritical driving force of the new product consumption behavior. Similar \\nbehavior was observed for other small equipment such as for “MP3/MP4 \\nplayers ” (Cai et al., 2020 ) and for “notebooks ” (Rodrigues et al., 2020 ). \\nSuch high device replacement rates can indicate future EG (Arain et al., \\n2020 ). On the other hand, Shaikh et al. (2020) mentioned that con-\\nsumers from Pakistan tended to buy new EEE due to their needs, not for \\nluxury, regardless of the new product introduction in the market. \\n4.2.1.5. Factors affecting device replacement. Ongondo and Williams \\n(2011) found that among the various parts of a mobile phone, replacing \\nbatteries was the most frequent activity among students for which the \\ndevice was replaced. New device purchases do not necessarily depend \\non products being malfunctioned; instead, consumers demand improved \\nquality or capacity. Echegaray (2016) identified that “technical failure ” M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n12serves as a proxy indicator for product obsolescence, and this is observed \\nas a tangible reality for all individuals. Milovantseva and Saphores \\n(2013a) found that getting a more recent model is their primary moti-\\nvation for replacement in the case of MPs. Replaced phones were still in \\nworking condition and hold economic value. \\nNowakowski (2016) mentioned that the time to replace LE is higher \\nthan SE. Jayaraman et al. (2019) found that computer literacy had a \\nsignificant moderation effect on laptop usage. If a user has a relatively \\nhigh knowledge of using laptops, then there is a high probability that \\ndevice replacement would occur after active use. \\n4.2.1.6. Perspectives of young consumers. Ongondo and Williams (2011) \\nidentified that young consumers ’ age was not associated with the fre-\\nquency of mobile phone replacing and the number of phones stockpiled \\nby students. Islam et al. (2020b) found that the \"number of items in use\" \\nlaptops, television sets, and DCs were significantly associated with age, \\nincome, and household size of young consumers in Australia. Around \\n28% of the students changed their MPs every year. Besides device fail-\\nure, mobile phone replacement because of the upgrades from network \\noperators was dominant, and this should be considered the planned \\nobsolescence. The young consumers ’ lifestyle was found responsible for \\nthe shorter lifespan of MPs (or the damage of the phones). Although \\nlimited, a small proportion of the students changed their MPs due to \\nfashion pursuit. Wieser and Tr¨oger (2018) found that the definition of \\n\"up-to-datedness\" of a mobile phone varied. For example, old re-\\nspondents perceived that their MPs were not technologically or \\naesthetically obsolete, opposite to the young. \\n4.2.1.7. Product-lifespan. Product lifespan-related articles are summa -\\nrized in Table 4. \\nOverall, product lifespan is a critical parameter that is generally used \\nto estimate EG. Furthermore, for a similar product, the reported value of \\nproduct lifespan may provide a tentative international comparison for \\nfuture studies and define that product ’s lifespan profile. Table 5 shows \\nthe lifespan of various e-waste items. \\n4.2.2. Analyzing consumers ’ storage behavior \\nAfter useful life of an EEE, consumers tend to store the equipment at \\nhouseholds before it reaches to collection points or the household bin, \\nespecially for small WEEE items such as MPs. Although this issue is \\ncrucial and considered a significant barrier for potential acquisition for \\ncollection and recycling (Nowakowski, 2019 ), very few studies focused \\non this specific topic (around 10% of the articles). The number of items \\nstored at households, storage time before disposal, and reason for storage were critical aspects that were used by the articles identifying \\nconsumers ’ storage behavior. Summary of the storage behavior related \\nstudies is presented in Table S4 in SI of this article. \\n4.2.2.1. General trend of device storage. In Switzerland, Thi´ebaud et al. \\n(2018) found similar storage behavior for almost all types of electronic \\nproducts. The study also found that a vast amount of the products was \\nstored and reused before reaching the collection scheme. In Lithuania, \\nDagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) found that approximately 31% of respondents \\nstored obsolete EEE, which later transferred to the collection points. In \\nPoland, Nowakowski (2019) found that computer accessories and other \\ninformation technology equipment were frequently stored by house -\\nholds (by over 60% of the respondents). For MPs, this was found above \\n80%. Another study by Nowakowski (2016) identified that SE stored per \\nhousehold was 1.5, while medium-sized equipment was stored one item \\nper two households. In Ireland, Casey et al. (2019) identified that small \\ne-waste items are generally existing in less visible and more fluid states \\ndue to the understanding of \"lying somewhere in the house\" on shelves \\nand in drawers, which resulted in addressing e-waste differently than \\nother recyclable materials. Ongondo and Williams (2011) observed that \\nthere is at least one mobile phone stockpiled for every student working \\nout the average in the UK. Martinho et al. (2017) addressed that \\nsmartphones have a higher reuse potential than tablets in the overall \\nstorage behavioral pattern of Portuguese consumers. \\nIn China, Zhang, L. et al. (2019) found that students ’ storage \\nbehavior was predominant (58% of the respondents). Tan et al. (2018) \\nfound that 62.1% of residents stored their MPs among the participants, \\nwhile only 4.7% disposed of their WMPs in the formal collection facil-\\nities. Bai et al. (2018) estimated that WMP stored at home was 1.79 per \\nperson, and over the years, and surprisingly, it was observed that con-\\nsumers became conservative in giving out their used phones to the \\nrecycling channels. \\nIn Brazil, Rodrigues et al. (2020) found that more than half of the \\nrespondents intended to maintain out-of-use EEE, where small EEE \\nproducts were stored the most compared to large EEE, as limited space is \\nrequired. \\n4.2.2.2. Dominant stored products. The top hibernated products were \\n“MPs” (Blake et al., 2019 ), and “laptops ” (Ramzan et al., 2020 ), followed \\nby DC (Singh et al., 2018 ), “mobile chargers ” (Bovea, M.D. et al., 2018 ), \\n“computer mouse ” (Shaikh et al., 2020 ), “hairdryers ” (Pandebesie et al., \\n2019 ), “digital cameras ” (Pandebesie et al., 2019 ), “refrigerators ” \\n(Singh et al., 2018 ), “DVD players ” (Singh et al., 2018 ), “CRT TV sets” \\n(Singh et al., 2018 ). Regarding MPs storage, similar trend was shown by \\nPandebesie et al. (2019) in Indonesia; Ramzan et al. (2019) in China, \\nand Shaikh et al. (2020) in Pakistan. Singh et al. (2018) found that both \\n“MPs” and “laptops ” were the top hibernated products in India. Now-\\nakowski (2016) found that both MPs and their chargers were the main \\nstored items in Poland. On the other hand, in Brazil, “mobile chargers ” \\nand “digital cameras ” were widely stored electronic product (Rodrigues \\net al., 2020 ). \\n4.2.2.3. Motivating factors behind storage behavior. Top cited reasons for \\nstoring old devices found in the studies are shown in Table 6. These \\ninclude barriers to recycling, such as cost and inconvenience, as well as \\nthe benefits of keeping devices, such as spare parts, data retention or to \\ngive to other people. \\nMartinho et al. (2017) found that most respondents prefer to keep \\ne-waste items (smartphones and tablets) at home instead of recycling. \\nOptimistic consumers ’ attitudes were identified for reusing the products. \\nIslam et al. (2020a) concluded that the lack of familiarity with a recy-\\ncling program is critical for the observed WMP storage behavior. Wieser \\nand Tr¨oger (2018) concluded that emotional attachment to the phones \\ndue to data and information and the phones ’ qualities made consumers \\nnot dispose of it in any other means. Besides, consumers thought their \\nFig. 14.Top reasons for device replacement.  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n13kept phone would be used by someone instead of deliberately delivering \\nit to the recycling channel. In this process, reusing the phone with a \\nregular interval was common. In a cross-cultural study, Miliute-Plepiene \\net al. (2016) found that social norms are the most crucial factor in \\nstoring e-waste in Lithuania ’s early-stage recycling system; this did not \\napply to the case of Sweden. \\nInformation/data security was the principal reason for storing MPs. \\nBlake et al. (2019) mentioned that consumers tended to keep their de-\\nvice as a spare/backup, as it may have a monetary value. Similar reason \\nwas identified by Shaikh et al. (2020) . Bovea, M.D. et al. (2018) iden-\\ntified that e-book readers, GPS navigators, or radio alarm clocks were \\nstored because they could be used in the future as spare parts. Singh \\net al. (2018) identified that consumers often do not have or do not know \\nabout the dumping or resale opportunities of the discarded EEEs, which \\ntriggered storage habits. Qu et al. (2019) mentioned that little knowl -\\nedge on hazard and contamination of e-waste coupled with preserving \\nmemories motivated device hibernation behavior. \\n4.2.2.4. Mitigating measures against storage. Rodrigues et al. (2020) \\nfound that storage behavior could be changed by implementing recy-\\ncling policies, reverse logistic systems, environmental education, and \\nincentives for social participation. Casey et al. (2019) reported that charity campaigns and life transition circumstances (such as moving and \\nrenovation) could be internal and external triggers, respectively, against \\nhibernating behavior. \\nOngondo and Williams (2011) found that take-back services could \\nencourage students not to hoard more than one extra phone, but some \\nstudents may not participate even with knowledge of such schemes. \\nGreater a awareness of the “environmental value ” (the importance of \\nrecycling to reclaim the resources embedded) within the phone could \\nincrease participation. Arain et al. (2020) concluded that consumers ’ \\nawareness of stewardship responsibilities and lowering the personal cost \\nto recycle could be determining factors behind reducing storage habits. \\nZhang, L. et al. (2019) contend that university students stockpile large \\nand increasing amount of personal electronics, unless economic in-\\ncentives are given. Pierron et al. (2017) found that in a student ac-\\ncommodation setting, students were not interested storing as 1) there is \\nlimited space and 2) alternatives (recycling, discarding, reusing, selling) \\nare now more readily available than previously. This finding is different \\nfrom others, where, in most cases, consumers wanted to store their de-\\nvices at home. \\nNowakowski (2016) concluded that for developing countries, storing \\nand later reusing is expected behavior. The situation becomes intensified \\nwhen the purchase price of the product is significantly higher, such as Table 4 \\nSummary of product lifespan-related articles.  \\nDiscussion focus Reference Summary \\nMPs Abbondanza and Souza (2019)  •MPs are the fastest growing e-waste items than CRT monitors, refrigerators and \\nfreezers, and CRT TVs \\nCai et al.

Improvement of WEEE returns ’ convenient methods is a \\ncrucial factor enhancing the collection rate (for recycling) of stockpiled \\ne-waste. Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) found that consumers tended to repair \\ntheir MPs if they were malfunctioning and if the operation is economi -\\ncally feasible; otherwise, the phones were stored or to a limited extent \\nthrew with household municipal waste. \\n4.2.2.5. Storage period. Milovantseva and Saphores (2013b) found that \\nstoring waste TV sets for up to 5 years was evident in American \\nhouseholds where the number of sets was one or more. Kurisu et al. \\n(2020) determined that PCs were disposed of within one year of storage. \\nHowever, 3.8% of PCs were hibernated for more than ten years. Islam \\net al. (2020a) found that the average storage time (0.57 –1.17 years) for \\nMPs is similar for Swiss and Australian consumers. Results on hiber -\\nnating time showed that all types of personal electronics have been \\nretained for less than 3 years, with the longest retaining time close to 3 \\nyears (for DCs) (Zhang, L. et al., 2019 ). \\n4.2.2.6. Socio economic factors. Milovantseva and Saphores (2013b) \\nfound that pro-environmental behavior in the past 12 months, age, ed-\\nucation, household size, marital status, the gender of the head of \\nhousehold, type of dwelling, and geographic location was strongly \\nassociated with the junk TVs storage among American households. The \\nauthors also identified that larger households are more likely to have \\nmore junk TVs, while the converse was true when household income \\nincreases. Furthermore, the consumers ’ geographical locations impacted waste TV storage behavior, and in that case, the age of the sets was equal \\nor greater than 16 years old. Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) indicated that age \\nhas a positive association with storage. For example, due to limited \\npurchase power, students tended to use the products as spares. Another \\nstudy by Saphores et al. (2009) identified that except for knowledge of \\ne-waste and income, all other explanatory variables age, marital and \\nemployment status, ethnicity, household size, previous e-waste recy-\\ncling behavior, and to some extent education, homeownership, and \\nunderstanding the consequences of recycling were found significant \\nindicators describing the households ’ e-waste storage behavior. \\nPandebesie et al. (2019) found that storage behavior is affected by \\nthe consumers ’ residential conditions. Arain et al. (2020) mentioned \\nthat attaining a certain level of education alone is not sufficient to \\neliminate storage behavior and lack of knowledge among consumers \\nregarding disposal options, such as the location of proper facilities and \\nconcerns regarding personal data security, the main reasons for storage. \\nQu et al. (2019) reported that 80% of all residents had more than one \\nWMP stored at home, while 17% of them had more than four WMPs. One \\nof the apparent reasons behind this was high disposable income. Mar-\\ntinho et al.

(2018) mentioned that the storage of dis-\\ncarded EEEs is a problem in quantification and recycling. Casey et al. \\n(2019) found that keeping household items can be divided into two main \\ncategories: 1) disused or broken and 2) abandoned. In both cases, over \\ntime, the value of stored items dissipates, which is often more trouble -\\nsome than recycling or discarding it. \\n4.2.3. Analyzing consumers ’ disposal behavior \\nWhen consumers finally decide to dispose of unwanted EEE, many \\noptions are generally available to them. It could be formal disposal paths \\narranged and managed by government authorities or informal collection \\nservices managed by local scrap metal recyclers, paddlers, waste col-\\nlectors, etc. The second practice is widely used in developing countries \\nwhere recycling is done by a crude process such as acid leaching. \\nIdentifying “disposal pattern ” is one of the significant issues of con-\\nsumers ’ behavior that can provide valuable information on the existing \\ne-waste collection system and opportunities to improve it. This issue was \\ninvestigated in most of the articles (26% of the articles). In the following \\nsub-sections, issues related to consumers ’ disposal behavior are \\nreviewed. Table S5 (in the SI) provides in-depth details of each of the \\narticles at the country level, highlighting the main research problems \\nidentified in the articles. \\n4.2.3.1. Mode of disposal. Fig. 15 shows the top disposal methods \\nidentified by the articles reviewed. Overall, “store at home ” is found as \\nthe most common disposal method but is typically temporary, as discussed previously. The reason was identified by the 34% of the \\narticle. Some of the corresponding studies mentioning this top disposal \\nmethod were research performed by Borthakur and Govind (2019) in \\nIndia for computer and MPs; Chi et al. (2014) in China for various small \\nand large electronic equipment; Islam et al. (2020a) in Australia for MPs; \\nMartinho et al. (2017) in Portugal for smartphones and tablets; Miner \\net al. (2020) in Nigeria for e-waste in general; Ongondo and Williams \\n(2011) in UK for MPs; Shaikh et al. (2020) in Pakistan for “screen and IT \\nequipment ” category; Siringo et al. (2020) in Indonesia for large and IT \\nequipment category; Wieser and Tr¨oger (2018) in Austria for MPs; and \\nZhang, L. et al. (2019) in China for personal IT equipment. Besides the \\ntop methods shown in Fig. 15, some other notable methods of e-waste \\ndisposal were identified which are presented in Table 7. In-depth details \\nof the studies are given in Table S5 in the SI of this review article. \\nDepending upon the types and socio-economic conditions of con-\\nsumers, e-waste flows at different channels. For example, Song et al. \\n(2012) mentioned that people from less developed areas preferred to \\ngive MPs to friends, relatives, and other organizations while waste ACs \\nand PCs were sent to manufacturers. On the other hand, Bovea, M.D. \\net al. (2018) found that “I threw it in the trash ” and “I replaced it with \\nanother type of appliance ” were the primary method and reasons for \\ndisposal, respectively for SE. For DCs, “collection by manufacturers ” and \\n“at electronic retail stores ” were standard practices in Japan (Kurisu \\net al., 2020 ). \\nDelivering e-waste to various recycling channels existed a practice \\namong consumers. For example, Wang et al. (2011) mentioned that \\n41.79% of residents used various recycling channels, 36.79% discarded Product lifespan (in years) \\nE-book \\nreaders Desktop \\ncomputer Laptops Hard \\ndisks \\ndrive Global \\npositioning \\nsystem \\nnavigators \\n(GPS) Radio \\nalarm \\nclocks \\n(RAC).

For \\nexample, Ongondo and Williams (2011) found that selling is happening \\namong consumers, companies, or individuals. Singh et al. (2018) found \\nthat most consumers disposed of their e-waste to informal e-waste col-\\nlectors and recyclers. Chi et al. (2014) in China found the same. Informal \\nsector e-waste disposal practice was considered as loss of energy and \\nresources due to its unfriendly recycling nature (Ramzan et al., 2019 ). \\nDespite the fact, Borthakur and Govind (2019) found, “I sell them to the \\nscrap dealers ” or ‘kawariwalas ’ as one of the disposal paths from where \\nconsumers got benefits. A similar result was found by Abbondanza and \\nSouza (2019) . \\nDonation is often considered as a gift from the donors (Ongondo and \\nWilliams, 2011 ). It is a product lifespan extension process that reduces \\nEG (Rodrigues et al., 2020 ). Lau et al. (2013) mentioned the entity of \\ndonation as “donated to non-profit making organizations. ” \\nP´erez-Belis, V. et al. (2015) concluded that besides the consumers \\nwho donate used toys to family or charities, around 67.1% of the con-\\nsumers dispose of their fractions of waste toys in domestic bins, while \\n32.9% of the respondents used recycling points. Nowakowski (2016) \\nmentioned that improper disposal practices existed among residents ’, \\nand many of the residents disposed of e-waste with household solid \\nwaste and selling the item to local scrappers. In Malaysia, Othman et al. \\n(2015) while approximately 14% of the E-waste generated by \\nlow-income residents would go through landfill sites. Among the young \\nconsumers, this practice also prevails. For example, Pasiecznik et al. \\n(2017) found that 12% of the respondents, mostly young people, threw \\ntheir e-waste in regular household bins. \\nCai et al. (2020) identified that “sell to second-hand market ” and \\n“sell to the qualified enterprise ” are the two variations of selling items to \\nothers. G¨ok et al. (2017) found the first one as the preferred method by \\nthe consumers. The authors also mentioned that “wait for the \\ndoor-to-door recovery ” was widely used for ACs, WMs, and refrigerators \\nand also for products that consumers perceived requiring “high repair \\ncost or cannot be repaired. ” Ravindra and Mor (2019) specifically \\nmentioned “selling it to the second-hand dealer. ” Self-disassembly and \\nsecond-hand use were found by Chi et al. (2014) . Wieser and Tr¨oger \\n(2018) identified that trading-in or selling MPs was performed for \\nyounger aged MPs to make a new mobile phone purchase. Kumar (2017) \\nmentioned that company-owned showrooms, authorized dealers, and \\ndistributors as organized channels and second-hand goods shops and \\nrepair shops as unorganized channels were the two primary paths for \\nmobile waste disposal. \\n4.2.3.2. Main disposed items – the product flow. Casey et al. (2019) \\nmentioned that e-waste type typically has gone through 4 different \\nstages, including 1) inactive EEE, 2) critical moment, 3) transition from \\nEEE to WEEE, and 4) divestment. Consumers ’ disposal practices largely \\ndetermine the final routes of e-waste (Chung et al., 2011 ). Dindarian \\net al. (2012) postulated that the product was discarded by customers ’ \\nchoice, not for the latest technology. On the other hand, Wieser and \\nTr¨oger (2018) mentioned that the mode of disposal varies depending on \\nthe replaced device ’s age. When consumers understand their mobile \\nphone has some value, it was preferred to reuse rather than other \\nchannels. \\nBefore reaching a final disposal point, products are hibernated. For \\nexample, Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) found that \"Store and later take it to the \\ncollection points\" was the disposal method, and MPs were disposed of \\nthe most. Afroz et al. (2012) identified that more than one-third of the \\nrespondents sent their unused EEE to charities and gave it to relatives \\nwhen they could not repair it. As there is no specific collection scheme \\navailable in the country, the authors found that little fraction of e-waste \\nwent to recycling facilities. “Self-disassembly and keep the useful parts\" \\nwere the most common disposal practice for desktop and laptop Table 6 \\nTop cited reasons for storing devices.    \\nBlake et al. \\n(2019) Kurisu et al. \\n(2020) Bovea, M.D. \\net al.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n17computers (Lau et al., 2013 ). Apart from storing WMPs at home, they \\nwere donated to relatives, friends, and charities (Tan et al., 2018 ). \\nFor second-hand use, consumers wanted to deliver used DCs, WMs, \\nand laptops (Chi et al., 2014 ). Thi´ebaud et al. (2018) identified that \\nfirsthand users disposed of CRT TVs and DVD players directly (at point \\nof disposal), while FDP TVs and monitors were sent for second-hand use. \\nA higher disposal rate was found for headsets and small loudspeakers \\nand was directly disposed of with general waste and after storage. In \\nIndia, Singh et al. (2018) found that MPs, laptops, cameras, WMs, ACs, \\nheaters, geysers, LED, and LCD televisions were the major disposed \\ne-waste items among the participants. Huang et al. (2006) mentioned \\nthat \"selling to waste collection centers was the main method to dispose \\nof waste TV sets, refrigerators, and ACs, and selling in the second-hand \\nmarkets was the key method to deal with waste PCs.\" \\nTypically, in Brazilian households, MPs were kept at home, and \\naudio-video equipment was sold mainly or passed along among rela-\\ntives, friends, or charity groups (Echegaray, 2016 ). Nguyen et al. (2009) \\nindicated that selling or giving the appliances to other users were pri-\\nmarily adopted TVs, refrigerators, WMs, and PCs. As per a study by \\nBovea, M.D. et al. (2018) , MPs, cameras, and radio alarm clocks were \\ndisposed of by the Spanish households. Abbondanza and Souza (2019) \\nfound that smartphones, refrigerators, or freezers, and WMs were the \\nmost discarded items by Brazil ’s households. Despite being a developing \\ncountry, Islam et al. (2016) found that MPs and PC were the dominant \\nWEEE categories in Bangladeshi households. 4.2.3.3. Norms and perceived behavioral control. Nduneseokwu et al. \\n(2017) identified that infrastructure moderated the relationship be-\\ntween two influencing factors (attitude and subjective norm) and \\nintention. Consumers who did not recycle or recycled infrequently \\ntended to dispose of small WEEE in the general household refuse (Darby \\nand Obara, 2005 ). Recycling behavior reflected in practice is somewhat \\nrelated to the economic status of participants. Those who already had a \\nrecycling habit do not have an interest in incentives (Botelho et al., \\n2016 ). Pandebesie et al. (2019) showed that willingness to separate \\ne-waste among consumers was relatively high, and they were aware of \\nthe importance of separated waste. \\nEchegaray and Hansstein (2017) mentioned that “product disposal \\npractices remain hardly influenced by favorable views towards the \\nenvironment ”. On the other hand, education had an impact on disposal \\nbehavior. For example, Saritha et al. (2015) found in their survey that \\n41.2% of the respondents would consider disposing of old products in an \\neco-friendly manner, while 94% agreed to return it to the manufacturer \\nfor free if the latter claimed to recycle products in an eco-friendly \\nmanner. Technical knowledge of product use also influences an in-\\ndividual ’s perception regarding disposal. For example, Jayaraman et al. \\n(2019) showed that social consequences and the conviction of in-\\ndividuals ’ laptop disposal practices strongly depend on knowledge of \\ncomputer literacy. \\n4.2.3.4. Influencing factors-associated with disposal decision. Infrastruc -\\nture was found as one of critical factors that determined willingness, \\npositive behavior and attitude towards e-waste recycling and selecting \\ndisposal routes (Nduneseokwu et al., 2017 ). Table 8 shows some of the \\nother factors affecting consumers disposal decision. \\nThe reasonable distance was critical for recycling infrastructure \\n(Arain et al., 2020 ). In developing countries, the informal sector e-waste \\ncollection is generally expected. Consumers preferred to deliver e-waste \\nto the channel due to economic benefits (Chung et al., 2011 ), as e-waste \\nis considered a valuable commodity (Borthakur and Singh, 2020 ). \\nCentral processing units (CPUs) of DCs, computer monitors, keyboards, \\nmice, printers, cellular phones, and landline telephones were considered \\nvaluable e-waste (Rodrigues et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, if e-waste is not \\nrepaired, it is thrown away; buying a new one is a common trend \\n(Shaikh et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, Blake et al. (2019) found that \\ndesign (built-in obsolescence), marketing and fashion trends, or the \\nspeed of technology advancement were the main factors for high \\ndisposal. \\nTan et al. (2018) found that consumers expect to receive specific \\nrevenue for various disposal modes. “The difference between the high \\nFig. 15.Top disposal methods of e-waste.  \\nTable 7 \\nOther methods of e-waste disposal among consumers.  \\nMethod Studies those indicated such method \\n“Throwing e-waste with household solid waste/mixed \\nwaste ” Arain et al.

(2017) found that consumers kept the phones due to the \\nlow price for second-hand phones in the second-hand market. Identi -\\nfying “best exchange offers and price ” is the most critical factor for \\nproduct return (Chi et al., 2014 ). Similar result was also identified by \\nDwivedy and Mittal (2013) . In that case, Kumar (2017) argued that \\norganized channels could provide incentives to consumers under the \\nbuyback scheme. \\nIn terms of the e-waste collection method, Chi et al. (2014) found \\nthat consumers demanded to “collect other municipal wastes, ” “free \\ndoor-to-door collection, ” “collect during a non-working time, ” “easy \\naccess to collectors, ” “provide repairing and cleaning service. ” The in-\\nfluence of online internet-based collection systems is gaining popularity; \\nhowever, understanding consumers ’ preferences regarding modes (on-\\nline and offline) of collecting e-waste (mainly obsolete MPs) was found \\nparamount (Liu et al., 2019 ). \\nProduct use could also be an indicator of the e-waste disposal trend. \\nFor example, Li et al. (2012) indicated that respondents with high in-\\ncome or good education possessed most high-tech household appliances \\nadvanced in technology and had the flexibility to use. \\n4.2.3.5. Impact of socio-economic variables in disposal behavior. Several \\nstudies applied statistical methods. Several independent socioeconomic \\nvariables were found significant; however, it is often hard to generalize \\nthe predictability of behavior indicators, mainly because of externalities \\n(economic growth, local manufacturing, public policy, and others). For \\nexample, Abbondanza and Souza (2019) found that regional variation \\n(pace of development across a country ’s regions) influenced disposal \\nbehavior. Some common variables are mentioned in Table 9. \\nBotelho et al. (2016) found that ’exchange for money ’ (mainly \\ndemanded by males) was the expected incentive in Portugal, followed by \\n’exchange for new EEE, ’ ’discount coupons on services ’ (females and \\nconsumers with a high level of education), ’collection of EEE at home ’ \\n(females). Income and occupation, mainly in the environmental sector, \\ninfluenced factors using e-commerce and professional recycling sites \\n(Zhang, B. et al., 2019 ). \\nOthman et al. (2015) found that approximately 86% of the e-waste \\ngenerated by low-income residents would go through four options of a \\nwaste management system, i.e., reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and \\nrecycling. On the other hand, Song et al. (2012) concluded that Macau \\nresidents did not consider the small financial benefit of selling discarded \\nelectronic products, which was different from mainland Chinese resi-\\ndents. In terms of e-waste sorting, Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) found that \\nfemales preferred to do. For product-focused disposal behavior, Dwiv -\\nedy and Mittal (2013) found that in India, the age of waste microwave \\novens was relatively shorter, and consumers who were between 35 and \\n60 years old, owned cars, and were of middle to high income discarded \\nmost of the ovens. \\n4.2.3.6. Barriers associated to disposal. Ardi et al. (2020) found that \\nconsumers ’ disposal behavior was primarily influenced by lacking \\nwell-established collection systems. Siringo et al. (2020) found that only \\n2% of respondents voluntarily participated in formal e-waste recycling. \\nDisposal using municipal waste was also a popular choice due to the \\nunavailability of appropriate options (Shaikh et al., 2020 ). High repair \\ncost/cannot also be repaired found to be the critical barrier for which \\ne-waste is stored or unrepaired (Blake et al., 2019 ). Cao et al. (2016) \\nindicated that due to \"OFN,\" LE was going to formal channels; however, \\nsmall-sized mobiles and cameras were stored at home and remained idle \\nwithout incentives. \\n4.2.3.7. Collection system/online recycling platforms. For a successful e- \\nwaste management system, reverse logistics is a critical aspect that has \\nbeen investigated in several articles. On the other hand, incentives are given to consumers, essentially motivate them to dispose of e-waste in \\nthe system. Policy associated with regulatory intervention and actors ’ \\ninvolvement in an e-waste recycling platform showed considerable \\nimpact on a collection system. Appropriate disposal behavior depends \\non consumers ’ awareness and knowledge regarding collection channels \\nand online recycling platforms. Articles that discussed the issues as \\nmentioned above are analyzed in the following subsections. \\n4.2.3.7.1. Reverse logistics. As seen earlier, infrastructural factors, \\nsuch as availability and convenient (access to) recycling facilities, were \\none of the critical components of an efficient collection system (Ndu-\\nneseokwu et al., 2017 ) and Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) indicated that con-\\nsumer demanded more collection points/containers. Convenience \\nappears to matter, as the number of consumers decreases with the in-\\ncrease of recycling centers distance (Darby and Obara, 2005 ). Similar \\nresult was found by Saphores et al. (2012) . Favot and Grassetti (2017) \\nfound that population density is negatively correlated with the kg of \\ne-waste collected. The number of collection points, % of female, % of \\nwaste separately collected were positively correlated with kg of E-waste \\ncollected. Rodrigues et al. (2020) identified that the number of dis-\\ncarded units and the number of households were two critical parameters \\nfor RL system design. Convenient transport facilities were also critical, \\nespecially for SE disposal for low-income residents (Darby and Obara, \\n2005 ). Darby and Obara (2005) also found that consumers needed in-\\nformation on how to dispose of WEEE and where it should be put for \\nrecycling for LE category. It is not clear under what circumstances \\nconsumers disposed of their items with household refuse or in the gen-\\neral waste at civic amenity (CA) sites for SE. This problem is also iden-\\ntified by Botelho et al. (2016) in Portugal. Sorting should be considered \\nan essential task at the initial stage of RL system development; however, \\nthis issue is less concerned. Although, G¨ok et al. (2017) found that \\nsorting e-waste from other types of waste was performed by 28% of the \\nparticipants, mostly YUSs. \\nFor young consumers, multiple options should be provided. Ongondo \\nand Williams (2011) concluded that students ’ union facilities and li-\\nbraries were the preferred central locations for disposal. Zhang, L. et al. \\n(2019) mentioned that “university students intend to choose online \\nrecycling platforms to dispose of obsolete electronics. ” Regarding online \\ncollection platforms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, atti-\\ntude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have a positive \\nimpact, while perceived risk has a negative impact on the behavioral \\nintentions of Chinese millennials on the adoption of online e-waste \\ncollection platforms (Ramzan et al., 2020 ). \\n4.2.3.7.2. Key attributes - provision of incentives. Cost of delivery (by \\nconsumers) to the collection system and receiving incentives were the \\ntwo significant attributes of a successful system. Blake et al. (2019) \\nfound that consumers preferred to disposal cost to be collected at the \\nproduct purchase point. Offering discounts/cashback during new \\nproduct purchases could be significant for greater participation (Mar-\\ntinho et al., 2017 ). Nixon et al. (2009) conclude that California house -\\nholds preferred a combined service provision - \"drop-off recycling at \\nregional centers,\" with \"curbside recycling\" including other options such \\nas Pay-As-You-Throw (PAYT), deposit-refund program at retail \\nlocations. \\nPark et al. (2019) found that a \"free of charge door-to-door collection \\nsystem\" was preferred by most of the respondents, and in that case, \\npublic relation activities should be increased. There is a need for direct \\ncommunication and booking channel with visiting engineers at the \\ne-waste collection facility (and as a free service), which the consumers \\npreferred. Due to the absence of a door-to-door collection system and \\nincentive options, often there is a high chance that consumers deliver \\ne-waste to the informal sector (Lau et al., 2013 ). Selling waste EEE items \\nto local small scrap dealers to get economic benefits was the most \\npreferred choice (Islam et al., 2016 ). Miner et al. (2020) identified that \\ndue to the lack of a door-to-door collection program, e-waste storage \\nbehavior was accelerated. In this regard, Pierron et al. (2017) mentioned \\nthat the stockpiled small e-waste category represented a vital source of M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n19revenue. \\nCao et al. (2018) mentioned that different economic and internet \\npenetration levels were the two main factors for developing efficient \\ncollection channels within a region. “Third-party integrated network \\nplatform integrate online, and offline resources were predicted to be \\nwidespread under the rapid development of IT and e-commerce. On the \\nother hand, Yin et al. (2014) mentioned that consumers demanded \\nofficial channel incentives. For WMPs, door-to-door collection services \\nwere not preferred. Zhang, B. et al. (2019) indicated that peddlers ’ \\non-site collection was still the dominant way of e-waste disposal and \\ne-commerce and professional recycling site were far less competitive. \\nThe authors also found that the e-waste disposal rate among low income \\n(<250 RMB/month) consumers were less while consumers with \\nincome>10,000 RMB/month preferred e-waste collection by peddlers, \\ne-commerce. Young consumers (<30 years old) preferred to use \\ne-commerce sites for e-waste disposal, while older people did not. \\n4.2.3.7.3. Policy-oriented regulatory intervention and actors ’ \\ninvolvement. Convenience and policy effectiveness influenced the youth \\ne-waste disposal intention (Shaharudin et al., 2020 ). At the \\nproduct-level, Tan et al. (2018) mentioned that WEEE-related regulation \\nis expected to affect mobile phone collection positively. Chung et al. \\n(2011) found that despite the absence of a producer responsibility \\nscheme (PRS) in the current EMS, customers still disposed of their \\ne-waste in the appropriate channels (around 17%). \\nTrust and quality of e-waste collection service (especially who and \\nhow involved in the system) were found to be significant factors among \\nconsumers. Consumers ’ trust is critical for market competitiveness for \\nthe recycling industry, and involvement and endorsement of the recy-\\ncling industry and government were imperative (Bai et al., 2018 ). For \\nexample, Song et al. (2012) indicated that consumers demanded gov-\\nernment departments or other organizations to be involved in the \\ne-waste disposal, mostly a well-developed collection system that \\nincluded a component “telephone reservation. ” In China, the “Green Box \\nProgram ” and “OFN activity ” (without incentives) were the two official \\ndisposal channels that consumers utilized (Yin et al., 2014 ). On the other \\nhand, Liu et al. (2019) concluded that consumers preferred \\ngovernment-operated facilities or through the collection by communi -\\ncations operators and retailers. \\nFurthermore, Martinho et al. (2017) mentioned that producer re-\\nsponsibility organizations (PROs), private entities (including \\nnon-government organizations (NGOs)) could be potential places for \\nsustainable disposal locations; however, a lack of knowledge regarding \\nsuch available options was evident. Kumar (2017) argued that multinational mobile manufacturing companies had collection points in \\nIndia, while local companies had no take-back mechanisms, and more \\nthan half failed to provide information on physical collection points. \\nAraujo et al. (2017) found that consumers preferred to have e-waste \\ncollection by manufacturer or seller. Second-hand retail shops should \\nalso be responsible, as Cao et al. (2016) found that “sell to second-hand \\nstores ” and “sell to after-sales repair stations ” were the two dominant \\nchoices. \\nEchegaray and Hansstein (2017) mentioned that the government \\nshould take advantage of municipal garbage collection systems (that \\nmay include a segregated solid waste collection) and manufacturers ’ or \\nretailers ’ point of disposal of e-waste to enforce current regulations. \\nAwasthi and Li (2018) argued that non-government organizations \\n(NGOs) could play a vital role in mediating consumers ’ improper \\ndisposal behavior where socio-cultural circumstances, lack of advanced \\ntechnology and infrastructure, and environmental considerations are \\nlimited. Besides, manufacturers and municipalities should be more \\nactive and involved in collection activities (Deniz et al., 2019 ). It is \\nnecessary to promote legal ways of disposal or prepare scrapyards for \\nlarge e-waste equipment (Nowakowski, 2016 ). \\n4.2.3.7.4. Impact of awareness and perception on disposal decision. \\nEnvironmental awareness was cited in the literature as a key factor \\ninfluencing disposal behavior (Ardi et al., 2020 ). Jayaraman et al. \\n(2019) mentioned that individual awareness had a positive impact on \\nlaptop disposal behavior. Giving information about e-waste and its \\nenvironmental risks would significantly increase proper disposal \\nbehavior (G¨ok et al., 2017 ), as a significant number of consumers did not \\nhave information about where to dispose of the e-waste (Dindarian \\net al., 2012 ). Gilal et al. (2019) mentioned that WOM significantly \\nimpacted consumers ’ e-waste disposal behavior, which also motivated \\nacting to recycle appropriately. Furthermore, well-designed and \\ndoor-stepping delivery of the campaigns could potentially shape con-\\nsumers ’ disposal behavior for the items. Botelho et al. (2016) found that \\nlack of awareness of consumers, delivery of e-waste-related information, \\nand the consumers ’ socio-demographic factors significantly affected \\nconsumers ’ motivation to return e-waste. \\n4.2.4. Analyzing consumers ’ R&R behavior \\nIn the light of the CE principle, R&R is the first step of the entire \\nclosed-loop chain that extends the product lifespan and reclaim the \\nvalue of used EEE. However, the researchers have not investigated this \\nissue extensively; only 8% of the articles (mostly from developed \\ncountries) discussed this specific consumer behavior. \\n4.2.4.1. Product design perspectives. Chuang and Liao (2018) examined \\nconsumer-driven innovation in green product designing, considering \\nTaiwanese residents focusing on the digital camera. Using conjoint \\nanalysis, the authors found that consumers ’ innovative design ideas \\ncould significantly improve product design, and this issue should be \\nconsidered in designing energy-related products. P´erez-Belis et al. \\n(2017) showed that 9.56% of the consumers had never repaired any \\nproducts that fall under the small e-waste category, while 0.75% of the Table 8 \\nFactors affecting consumers ’ e-waste disposal decision.  \\nFactor Reference \\n“Availability and convenient access to \\nrecycling facilities and service ” Arain et al.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n20participants bought second-hand small EEE. The study results also \\nrevealed that consumers demanded product information (in terms of \\ndesign and labeling) and the products ’ durability. On the other hand, \\n83.7% of the respondents of Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) ’s survey repaired \\nMPs when it was malfunctioning. Central problems of MPs were with the \\nbattery, software, button/buttons stop functioning, malfunctioning \\nduring power on/off (Borthakur and Singh, 2020 ). However, Wieser and \\nTr¨oger (2018) stated that MPs’ perceived speed of obsolescence was \\nvital for repair and reuse. Chi et al. (2014) mentioned that cell phones, \\nTVs, laptops, and refrigerators are the major products, which have sig-\\nnificant room for recirculation by repairing. Othman et al. (2015) \\nmentioned that manufacturers should design products that are easily \\nrepairable and incorporate recycled content and remanufactured \\ncomponents. \\n4.2.4.2. Barriers to repair and reuse. Bhatt et al. (2017) found that re-\\nspondents preferred to buy new MPs instead of repairing and reusing \\nthem due to the higher repair cost. It was also found valid for other types \\nof electronic products (Pandebesie et al., 2019 ). The same reason \\nidentified by Echegaray (2016) and the author mentioned that the \\nproduct-repair market remains underdeveloped due to manufacturers ’ \\nintention for higher returns selling new products. This reason is not only \\nprevalent in a developing country but also in developed countries. \\nConsumers from the developed country can buy a new EEE product \\ninstead of repairing as there is hardly any cost difference. This con-\\ntributes to increased EG, with Blake et al. (2019) finding that ’lack of \\nability to repair/the cost to repair ’ was one of the significant drivers for \\nEG. \\nSabbaghi and Behdad (2018) found that consumers have robust \\nrepair behavior for products, but that the cost of manufacturers ’ repair \\nservice can be a significant inhibitor, resulting in losses for both con-\\nsumers and manufacturers. The authors also estimated that WTP for \\nrepairing decreased at an annual rate of 6.7%. Yl¨a-Mella et al. (2015) \\nfound that reliability, perceived shorter product lifespan due to fast \\ntechnical progress, and the existence of new budget models were the \\nmain reasons not to purchase used phones. \\nAnother perspective of R&R is the second-hand market of the reus-\\nable product. Dindarian et al. (2012) found that current product design \\nand the lack of market for second-hand items are significant barriers to \\nproduct reuse. Bovea et al. (2017) showed that except for minor repairs \\nof heaters, toasters, and vacuum cleaners, most SE category products \\nwere not repaired. Availability of cheap spare parts and difficulties \\nduring the disassembly process were the main constraints for repairing. \\nThe study also found that only 9.6% of respondents repaired their \\nsmall-EEE, while less than 1% bought second-hand products from the \\nrepair shop. The reasons are also found valid for components (e.g., \\nbattery) of MPs and computers and accessories (Saritha et al., 2015 ). \\nLack of knowledge about repair and waiting periods were also critical \\nfor repair activities (P´erez-Belis et al., 2017 ). \\n4.2.4.3. Environmentally sustainable products. Bovea, M. et al. (2018) \\ninspected consumers ’ preferences in product design and labeling that \\ncan contribute to the CE, considering durability, repair-ability, recycled \\nmaterial content, low environmental impact, fair working conditions, \\nand origin. They found that Spanish consumers were concerned about \\nfair working conditions and durability of products. Kumar (2017) \\nmentioned that the repair-related secondary market is mostly dominated \\nby the informal sector, which has a relatively low-performance recir-\\nculating product in an environmentally friendly manner. The authors \\nmentioned that extending lifespan is also an indicator of environmental \\nproducts. P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) found that respondents who repaired \\nappliances (e.g., vacuum cleaners, juicers, and toasters) were using the \\nproducts for more than four years. On the other hand, for cheaper \\nelectronics, the cost of repair is generally found high. Thi´ebaud et al. \\n(2018) mentioned that after repair products ’ average service life is extended by at least 30%. \\n4.2.4.4. Secondhand product purchase. Second-hand product purchase is \\na relatively common practice in developing countries; for example, \\nAbbondanza and Souza (2019) mentioned second-hand product acqui -\\nsition from donations and directly from past users. \\nBovea, M.D. et al. (2018) found that more than half of the partici -\\npants (65.5%) never repaired broken e-waste items, while 87.6% of the \\nrespondents never bought second-hand EEE items. Similar results were \\nfound by P´erez-Belis, V. et al. (2015) for electronic toys in Spain. Chung \\net al. (2011) found that consumers would buy second-hand products if \\nthe reconditioned product ’s price were substantially lower than new \\nproducts, durability and performance of the reconditioned product is \\nguaranteed, and finally, the warranty level is similar to that of new \\nproducts. The authors also mentioned that there should be an authori -\\ntative quality assurance scheme that might take responsibility for \\nreconditioned products. Lacking the factors mentioned above in \\nrepaired products, 88% of the respondents of Fraige et al. (2012) ’s study \\nwere not interested in purchasing second-hand products. Even though \\npeople bought the products, that was mainly due to economic reasons \\nand for temporary use. These factors were also mentioned by Yl¨a-Mella \\net al. (2015) and Rodrigues et al. (2020) in their research. \\nEnvironmental education largely influences environmental \\nbehavior, specifically on second-hand product purchases (P´erez-Belis, V. \\net al., 2015a ). A higher percentage of households reused their old cell \\nphones than TV sets (Milovantseva and Saphores, 2013a ). Borthakur and \\nGovind (2019) found that instead of repairing, consumers tended to \\npurchase a new phone due to repair cost, which was the primary reason \\nfor new product purchase, followed by new product features, status \\nsymbol, and the ripple effect of other people purchasing new products. \\nBorthakur and Singh (2020) found that un-repairability was the main \\nreason for purchasing a new phone while repairing was an alternative \\nreason. The authors also mentioned that repair shop owners also \\ndiscourage consumers from repairing, as there are insignificant differ -\\nences between repair costs and new product purchases. The repair shops \\nare also acting as a selling point for second-hand items. As consumers \\nhave less intention to buy second-hand products, the shops might hold \\ntheir repaired items for longer, an indirect economic loss involved in the \\nprocess. \\nEchegaray (2016) mentioned that consumers believed that their \\ne-waste was beyond repair in most cases, although deliberate lifespan \\ncurtailment by producers or consumers directly influenced this \\nperspective. In that case, symbolic and planned obsolescence was both \\ncritical and existed. Consumers experience a technology-driven push \\n(purchase new EEE) and barriers in extending product lifespan, which \\nwas often a difficult choice assessing cost and benefits (of product \\nrepairing). \\nRodrigues et al. (2020) identified those vacuum cleaners, radio re-\\nceivers, CRT displays, and freezers were some of the devices that had the \\nopportunity for reuse. Second-hand items as gifts from others were not \\nexpected for printers, sandwich toasters, grills, and electric toasters. \\nNotebooks, CRT displays, radio receivers, and computers could be \\nconsidered during second-hand purchases. The authors also found that \\nthe main reasons for not buying second-hand items were \"new EEE is \\nbetter,\" cheaper, and guaranteed and mistrust of the durability of used \\nEEE, which is evident in most developed countries. Smartphones and \\ntablets have reuse potential (Martinho et al., 2017 ). \\n4.2.5. Analyzing consumers ’ recycling behavior \\nRecycling behavior often overlaps with disposal behavior. Around \\n16% of the articles explored the behavior, investigating either con-\\nsumers recycle their product or not (disposed of in a formal collection \\nfacility), any monetary incentives demanded by the consumers or not, or \\nin some cases, consumers preferences in selecting recycling facilities \\namong various available options. WTP was another aspect investigated M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n21by the articles to identify how much of the recycling fees consumers \\nwere willing to pay if any system requires it. This issue was mainly \\ndiscussed from the developing countries ’ context because no specific \\ncollection and recycling options are available to the customer. \\n4.2.5.1. Willingness to participate in a recycling system. Besides, WTP \\nconsumers ’ motivation/willingness towards participating in the formal \\ne-waste recycling system was one of the discussed issues in the investi -\\ngated articles. In the section, recycling-related determining factors from \\nthe consumers ’ end were analyzed. On the other hand, socio-economic \\nfactors, such as age, income, education, and others, impacted recy-\\ncling behavior. Specific characteristics of the formal recycling systems \\nwere analyzed as well, which were found to influence consumers ’ \\nparticipation in a recycling system. \\n4.2.5.1.1. Determining factors. According to Zhang, Y. et al. (2019) , \\ncompensation mode, collection price, and convenience degree were the \\nthree determining factors that enhanced participation of customers in a \\nMP recycling system. Thi Thu Nguyen et al. (2018) found “social pres-\\nsure”, while Li et al. (2012) found “inconvenience of recycling ” as the \\nfactor. Martinho et al. (2017) found awareness of the recycling program \\nand better communication strategies regarding recycling services were \\nthe two critical factor that could enhance consumers ’ participation. Such \\nfactors were also identified by Milovantseva and Saphores (2013a) , in \\naddition to “cost of recycling ” and “laws and regulations ”. \\nOn the other hand, Otto et al. (2018) mentioned that environmental \\nmotivation and behavioral costs were the main factors where the latter \\ncould be manipulated within the short term. In addition to that, envi-\\nronmental awareness and recycling prices were also critical (Cai et al., \\n2020 ). Siringo et al. (2020) mentioned the importance of recycling \\nintention, information, and recycling convenience for participation. \\nFrom the RL perspective, Blake et al. (2019) found that the structure of \\nthe services available, including provision and cost, was significant. \\nSiringo et al. (2020) found similar findings. \\n4.2.5.1.2. Socio economic factors and influencing components of TPB. \\nJafari et al. (2017) found that household income, household size, edu-\\ncation, e-waste awareness, and marital status were the main factors for \\nconsumers ’ incentive dependency. Kumar (2019) found that for young \\nconsumers, 1) attitude; 2) perceived control; 3) subjective norm and 4) \\nindividual responsibility were the main influencing factors, while con-\\nvenience and awareness did not have any influence on the behavior. \\nSaphores et al. (2012) found that moral norms, toxicity knowledge \\nabout the toxic content in e-waste, and recycling at work/school posi-\\ntively influence recycling behavior. Colesca et al. (2014) indicated that \\nrecycling knowledge, pro-environmental norms, and institutional sup-\\nport had a moderate effect on recycling behavior. Saphores et al. (2006) \\nfound that gender, education, convenience, and environmental beliefs \\nhad a strong relationship with the willingness to recycle, while income \\nor political affiliation were found insignificant. Table 10 shows the \\nsignificant and not significant socio-economic and demographic vari-\\nables responsible for e-waste recycling behavior. \\nRecycling behavior is strongly influenced by a “sense of duty ” and \\nperceived control, rather than subjective norms and benefits (Kumar, \\n2017 ). Nduneseokwu et al. (2017) and Wang et al. (2018) both \\nmentioned that attitude, subjective norm, and environmental knowl -\\nedge significantly influenced consumers ’ intentions to recycle. The \\nmediating factor, such as infrastructure, influenced attitude and sub-\\njective norm and intention. On the other hand, pro-environmental ac-\\ntivities and attitudes toward recycling small household electronics were \\nessential in recycling the specific category of e-waste. Moral norms and \\nenvironmental beliefs to recycle e-waste and to engage in \\npro-environmental behaviors were found critical. In e-waste recycling, \\nsubjective norms played a more significant role than the other constructs \\nof TPB (Milovantseva and Saphores, 2013a ). Similar trend was observed \\nby Wang et al. (2018) . Papaoikonomou et al. (2020) found that total \\nattitude (main significant predictor), WTP, information status, and subjective norm were other significant factors of WEEE recycling. \\n4.2.5.1.3. Characteristics of formal recycling system. Yl¨a-Mella et al. \\n(2015) found that convenience and proximity of recycling facilities and \\nservice should be considered as the main characteristics of a successful \\nrecycling system. Nixon et al. (2009) showed the importance of the \\nfactor as well coupled with the factor “cost”. On the other hand, in \\naddition to these factors, Wang et al. (2011) mentioned about economic \\nbenefits. “Need for more collection points ” (same as convenience) and \\n“refund system ” (economic benefits) were identified as the success fac-\\ntors of a recycling system by Dagili ¯ut˙e et al. (2019) . \\nA centralized collection facility (One-stop drop-off points for all \\ntypes of e-waste) could be an additional factor (Islam et al., 2020a ). Of \\ncourse, residential conditions and recycling habits were significant is-\\nsues in such aspects (Wang et al., 2011 ). However, Lakhan (2016) \\nidentified that perceived environmental harm and visible fees (as a \\nsticker on to a product) are strongly associated, which should be \\nconsidered as counter-productive factors for WTP. Providing the solu-\\ntion to this problem, Dwivedy and Mittal (2013) proposed that visible \\nand transparent fees and exchangeable sponsorship (where the ARF \\ncollected for one category of products is used to sponsor recycling of \\nanother category of products) in terms of fees should be implemented. \\nService-level integration could be built by E-waste recycling coupons, \\ngiven to householders via rates payment receipts (of local councils ’ rates \\nfor general waste collection services) (Blake et al., 2019 ). The monetary \\ninfluence was positively and significantly associated with the product \\ntake-back efforts, especially for young consumers (Ongondo and Wil-\\nliams, 2011 ). Song et al. (2012) mentioned that increasing the pop-\\nulation ’s education level and propagandizing e-waste knowledge to \\npromote residents ’ understanding should be considered a long-term and \\nshort-term approach, respectively. \\n4.2.5.2. Formal e-waste collection channel and EPR. Ramzan et al. \\n(2019) mentioned that voluntary-based formal programs have fewer \\nchances to ensure consumers ’ participation. Blake et al. (2019) identi -\\nfied that cost to recycle and lack of knowledge are the two barriers to \\nsuccess for the voluntary program. Qu et al. (2019) mentioned that \\ncollection price and collector ’s quality certification were the two critical \\nattributes selecting collection services among the consumers. In terms of \\nservice preference, compensation mode, collection price, and conve -\\nnience degree were the most significant factors for a formal collection \\nchannel (Zhang, Y. et al., 2019 ). \\nTan et al. (2018) found that convenience of collection facilities at \\nvarious locations, and a guarantee of information security was the \\nleading product return performance indicators. Arain et al. (2020) found \\nincentives and broader product coverage (especially small-sized \\ne-waste) as the indicators. When delivering products, \"make appoint -\\nment online or by phone first then have it picked up by the recycler\" was \\nthe preferred method of collection among consumers (Bai et al., 2018 ). \\nArain et al. (2020) identified that factors for accessibility to recycling \\ncenters were pick-up services, e-waste drives, or providing a recycling \\ndrop-off center near campus. Bouvier and Wagner (2011) identified that \\nrecycling fees and frequency of the recycling facilities ’ opening were \\nnegatively and positively correlated, respectively, with the number of \\nwaste TV sets and monitors collected (e.g., collection rate) in the recy-\\ncling facilities. Otto et al. (2018) identified collection cost reduction \\ntechniques as (1) curbside collection and deposit containers as a direct \\napproach, and (2) the material and social enticements as an indirect \\napproach. \\n4.2.5.3. WTP for formal EMS. Li et al. (2012) found that young con-\\nsumers were more in favor of “charging for discarding the product ” for a \\nformal EMS, and it varied from 0% to 5% of the recycling fees for the \\nproducts. Similar result was found by Ramzan et al. (2019) . On the other \\nhand, Liu et al. (2019) found that consumers ’ WTP for e-waste has not \\nincreased for WMPs. Chung et al. (2011) identified some preconditions M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n22of the WTP. They found that collecting recycling fees involves some \\ncritical issues, such as (1) a high degree of transparency (using recycling \\nfunds), (2) levied recycling fee, (3) visibility of the fees, (4) fees paid \\ndirectly to manufacturers, (5) cost that covers proper recycling, and \\nfinally, (6) fees paid at the point of purchase. In terms of method of \\npayment, Dwivedy and Mittal (2013) mentioned that a scheme charging \\nafter product take-back occurred is more preferred than advanced \\nrecycling fees (ARFs). Lakhan (2016) proposed that fees could be \\ncollected as \"environmental handling fees are a form of tax.\" \\nEven though manufacturers should be responsible solely for the \\nenvironment, consumers were willing to pay voluntarily to improve the \\nenvironment (showing pro-environmental behavior). For example, \\nAfroz et al. (2013) found that 52.5% of the residents showed a positive \\nattitude towards WTP for recycling system development. On the other \\nhand, Huang et al. (2006) ’s study showed that 70% of the respondents \\nwere willing to pay for environmental improvement in China, while 80% \\npurchasing environment friendly products. The amount of recycling cost \\nthat was agreed by the consumers (indicated as the highest percentage) \\nwas 0–5% of recycling cost (for households) (Yin et al., 2014 ), 5%–10% \\nof the product cost (Saritha et al., 2015 ), 10% of the product price \\n(Shaikh et al., 2020 ), 1–2% of the product market price (Dwivedy and \\nMittal, 2013 ). The quantitative assessment showed that the mean \\nmonthly fee of WTP agreed among residents in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \\nwas US$8.09 per household (Afroz et al., 2015 ), while Song et al. (2012) \\nfound that in China, the mean WTP lower and upper values were US \\n$2.20 and US$ 2.81 US dollar, respectively. Cai et al. (2020) found the \\namount as US$ 4.10 per month. For product-specific WTP, Arain et al. \\n(2020) identified that US$12.60 to recycle a 32′′television, and US$2.90 \\nto recycle a battery, US$11.30 for a laptop, US$7.80 for a cell phone. \\nArain et al. (2020) also found that batteries, cell phones, and 32′′tele-\\nvisions, laptops were among the top products for which consumers were \\nwilling to pay a recycling fee. Liu et al. (2019) found that some partic -\\nipants thought that paying for e-waste recycling is unrealistic. Same \\nissue was previously identified by Afroz et al. (2012) . Song et al. (2012) \\nfound that the reasons behind not willing to pay for recycling vary \\nsubstantially depending on the participants ’ socioeconomic condition. \\nFor example, some consumers believed that it is the government ’s re-\\nsponsibility (services should be free of charge) (Song et al., 2012 ). As the \\ninformal sector pays consumers economic benefits, for this reason, most \\nconsumers felt reluctant to pay fees (Dwivedy and Mittal, 2013 ). Low \\nhousehold income and satisfaction with the current situation were also \\nfound to be the reasons for such a negative attitude (Islam et al., 2016 ). \\nIn addition to that, Dwivedy and Mittal (2013) also found that higher \\ncost of living, lack of time, and non-mandated regulations were some of \\nthe other causes of the attitude. \\nAccording to Afroz et al. (2015) , education level, age, and household \\nincome significantly impacted households ’ WTP for improving the \\nWEEE management system. Similar results were found by Song et al. \\n(2012) . Li et al. (2012) mentioned that educational level and awareness \\nof recycling WEEE positively influenced WTP while income level did \\nnot. \\n4.2.5.4. Reverse logistics. According to Chung et al. (2011) , existing RL \\nsystem should be more convenient, reliable, and accessible to con-\\nsumers. Similar results were found from Yl¨a-Mella et al. (2015) ’s study. \\nFavot and Grassetti (2017) found that additional collection points would \\nenhance e-waste collection rate. Regarding the collection channels, \\nmore specifically for MPs, drop-off bins at retail stores and wireless \\nservice provider stores would be potential locations (Milovantseva and \\nSaphores, 2013a ). (Milovantseva and Saphores, 2013a ) mentioned of \\nmail-back services with incentives as the potential method. Ongondo \\nand Williams (2011) mentioned about library. Otto et al. (2018) \\nmentioned about central locations for arranging e-waste collection \\nevent. For recycling service selection, Bai et al. (2018) proposed that \\nrecycling services would positively impact new MPs’ sales. Consumers would choose a seller with the recycling service over other (conven -\\ntional) sellers, and the price was given importance over convenience. \\nDeng et al. (2017) found that “price ” (the most critical factors), \"ease of \\nexecution,\" \"ease of contact,\" \"ease of finding the location,\" \"appropriate \\nmethod of treatment/mobile phone recycling,\" and \"service time\" were \\nthe key variables in consumers ’ recycling experience. For highly-priced \\nMPs, rewards are expected, and for cheaper models, convenience (Bai \\net al., 2018 ). However, two main barriers act in the process, specifically, \\nfor convenience degree of collection mode - excessive time and money \\n(Zhang, Y. et al., 2019 ). To minimize the RL process complexity and cost, \\nBai et al. (2018) proposed that third-party recycling campaigns, \\nconvenient online second-hand transaction platforms would be benefi -\\ncial. Jafari et al. (2017) mentioned that government support and private \\nsector investment, awareness-building efforts should be the focus on \\nareas of RL process optimization. \\n4.2.5.5. Informal sector. The informal sector is one of the key actors in \\nthe recycling chain and contributes to the circulation of materials and \\nproducts. In other words, the informal sector influenced recycling \\nbehavior (Wang et al., 2016 ). Lau et al. (2013) found that selling e-waste \\nto private (informal) e-waste collectors was the most preferred way \\namong consumers due to perceived convenience. Environmental \\nawareness, attitude, perceptions regarding informal recycling, and in-\\ncome were the direct determinants, whereas costs of recycling, social \\nnorms, and publicity were indirect factors selecting informal sector \\ne-waste collectors (Wang et al., 2016 ). Cao et al. (2018) identified that \\nleading collectors ’ channels for e-waste were street peddlers, appliance \\nrepairing stores, waste collection stations, and dismantling workshops. \\nOn the other hand, Zhang, B. et al. (2019) found street peddlers, \\ne-commerce sites and professional collection sites were the main chan-\\nnels. The informal sector ’s main characteristics providing collection \\nservices were convenient, flexible, accessible, acceptability of a wide \\nrange of e-waste categories (Chi et al., 2014 ). \\n4.2.5.6. Online-recycling platform. With the digital data-driven society, \\nconsumers are more willing to use online-based services for product \\npurchase and product disposal. Zhang, L. et al. (2019) found that young \\nstudents (as a growing consumer segment) are preferred to use online \\nrecycling platforms. Incentives are found interrelated with the willing -\\nness to participate in an online recycling platform. For example, Wang Table 10 \\nFactors affecting e-waste recycling behavior.  \\nSocio-economic \\nvariable or \\nothers Significant Insignificant \\nGender Echegaray and Hansstein \\n(2017) , Milovantseva and \\nSaphores (2013a) , Martinho \\net al.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n23et al. (2019) found that willingness to deliver e-waste to online plat-\\nforms was positively influenced by perceived behavioral control, sub-\\njective norms, attitudes, and economic motivation. Wang et al. (2019) \\nalso found that due to more significant economic benefits, willingness to \\nparticipate in the platforms is higher than traditional (informal) section \\ncollection and recycling. \\n4.2.5.7. Critical barriers to recycling. Some of the critical barriers need \\nto be focused on an efficient recycling system. For example, Liu et al. \\n(2019) and Bai et al. (2018) found that information leakage, incentive, \\nand convenience must be considered for any recycling system, while Thi \\nThu Nguyen et al. (2018) found that the inconvenience of recycling was \\nnegatively correlated to residents ’ recycling behavioral intention. For \\nwaste MPs, Saritha et al. (2015) identified the main reasons for not \\nrecycling were lack of formal collection channels, and price of returned \\nproduct. On the other hand, Tan et al. (2018) found ‘low public \\nawareness of collection responsibility ’ and ‘insufficient promotion of \\nformal collection ’ were the reasons associated to that. According to \\nFraige et al. (2012) , cost of recycling (the most critical reason), lack of \\nrecycling plants, lack of legislation and management systems, lack of \\nawareness, lack of public trust regarding recycled equipment, and the \\nunstable generation of WEEE that needs recycling were the main bar-\\nriers. Gu et al. (2017) mentioned that consumers ’ lack of awareness \\nregarding the appropriate destination of e-waste (“do not know where to \\nsend waste ”), unexpected privacy disclosure, troublesome procedure, \\nand lack of public awareness were the critical barriers to the recycling \\nsystem. \\n5.Results and discussion \\nTo enable a smooth transition towards CE, a multifaceted approach \\ninvolved integrated measures is critical. This section discusses possible \\npolicy initiatives towards sustainable EM and business model innovation \\nfrom the CE viewpoint, based on the in-depth literature review pre-\\nsented in section 4. Table A1 (in the appendix) provides a consumer- \\ncentric CE framework that connects the critical elements of CE build -\\ning blocks, actors involved, sectoral perspective, and associated path-\\nways of CE (combing elements of Figs. 1 and 2). This addresses a key gap \\nin academic research to date by integrating all of these aspects in a single \\nframework that focuses on consumer behavior and e-waste. This is \\npotentially advantageous for developing national-level strategies and \\npolicies, with Table A1 also enabling the identification of future research \\nopportunities. Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 discuss policy implications \\nand business model development, respectively, in order to answer RQ1 \\nin relation to the need for an operational framework to achieve CE \\naround e-waste. Specifically, Section 5.3 addresses the major research \\ngaps and potential future research opportunities in the research field. \\n5.1. Policy implications towards CE \\nThis section discusses policy-related issues such as consumers ’ \\nawareness improvement measures, economic incentives to consumers, \\ninfrastructure development, and regulatory interventions. Such discus -\\nsion would enable governments ’ effort towards developing sustainable \\ne-waste management systems and achieving a circular economy. \\n5.1.1. Consumer awareness campaigns and pathways for information \\ndissemination \\nA diverse range of consumers (households, individuals, university \\nstudents) was analyzed in the reviewed articles. There is a clear need for \\nincreased effort to organize awareness-raising programs and publicize e- \\nwaste collection and disposal-related information. Sector-specific pro-\\ngrams to raise public awareness should be planned and delivered, tar-\\ngeting households, schools, universities, and the private sector (Islam \\net al., 2016 ). Specific education and course materials (in early childhood or elementary education) resulted in the successful collection of small \\nWEEE in Spain (Sol´e et al., 2012 ). This approach can lead to the creation \\nof an entirely new consumer base across diverse countries who are \\nenvironmentally cautious and understand their roles and responsibilities \\nin a sustainable EMS. Awareness-raising campaigns should include \\ne-waste sorting, associated service providers, available disposal \\nmethods, material content, recycling campaigns, environmental pro-\\ntection, internet-based online collection system, and product labeling \\n(e-waste logo at the back of an EEE). Additionally, if e-waste is recycled \\n(resource conservation), then information on the amount of material \\nand energy saved should also be the campaigns ’ components. \\nThe government, more specifically, local government, plays a crucial \\nrole in disseminating knowledge and information on e-waste to the \\npublic to improve their e-waste management and recycling habits (Davis \\nand Herat, 2008 ). The media used for information dissemination could \\nbe via newspaper, audiovisual, personal communication, television and \\nradio, websites or mobile apps, posters, information leaflets, social \\nmedia, word of mouth (WOM), pilot projects, workshops, and seminars. \\nAmong these media, social networking sites are considered to be a \\ncost-effective path for delivering this information (Ramzan et al., 2019 ). \\nTo reinforce moral and social norms, church groups might play a critical \\nrole (Saphores et al., 2012 ). Physical locations for disseminating infor-\\nmation could be residential building entrances, shopping centers, and \\ntransport (during morning and evening consumers ’ travel time). The \\nworkplace could also be an essential place to raise awareness as working \\npeople spend much of their time in these areas. \\nThe contents of awareness-raising material and frequency of circu-\\nlating the information were found to be crucial in the reviewed studies. \\nFor information materials, attractive design and colors could be used \\nand feedback sheets on current service satisfaction could be added. \\nProduct labeling with easily visible e-waste signs should be designed. \\nHousehold waste collection bins should have stickers that inform con-\\nsumers not to dispose of their e-waste items into the bin should be \\nprepared (Lakhan, 2016 ). Source separation at the generation point (e. \\ng., households) should be encouraged for adequate recovery. Publicizing \\ninformation on the CE should also be promoted in a broader context. \\n5.1.2. Consumer-focused economic incentives \\nEconomic incentives aimed at consumers are crucial to ensuring that \\ndisposed e-waste reaches formal collection and recycling facilities. \\nEconomic incentives can eliminate unused EEE items ’ storage behavior \\nand improper disposal of e-waste (Nowakowski, 2019 ). Liu et al. (2019) \\nconcluded that for value-added products, such as smartphones, in-\\ncentives are critical. Similar comment was made by Tan et al. (2018) . \\nMPs’ penetration rate should be considered as a regional development \\nindicator. MPs often become obsolete due to \"service contract ending,\" \\nsuch as the case found by Martinho et al. (2017) in Portugal. Ongondo \\nand Williams (2011) found the same reason existed in UK. As MP service \\noperators are playing a critical role in EoL product management, one \\nstrategy could be proving additional internet data packages to con-\\nsumers as incentives to collect old unwanted phones. \\nDirect incentives such as “trade-in for cash ” (Tan et al., 2018 ), “old \\nfor new” (Chi et al., 2014 ) or “discount/cashback offers ” (Martinho \\net al., 2017 ) have been found to be practical ways of providing financial \\nincentives to encourage a CE for e-waste. In determining the optimal \\nlevel of incentives, the discarded (or reusable) items ’ local market price \\nneeds to be estimated, with Kumar (2017) highlighting the importance \\nof understanding \"consumer selling behavior\" in order to determine an \\nappropriate incentive to return products such as MPs. This is particularly \\nimportant in developing countries with intensive competition between \\nthe informal sector and formal e-waste collectors. However, according to \\nBenabou and Tirole (2003) , incentives are weak behavior reinforcers \\nover the short term and negatively impact long term behavior. In-\\ncentives are also dependent on socio-demographic variables (Botelho \\net al., 2016 ). Jafari et al. (2017) stated that household size, income level, \\neducation, and marital status were some of the variables. Students could M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n24be given monetary rewards (approximately USD 5 per student for small \\nhousehold appliances) considering value retrieved from secondary ma-\\nterials (Pierron et al., 2017). \\nDeposit-return schemes should be given special attention as an \\nessential economic instrument (Saphores et al., 2012). These could be \\napplied to both developed nations and developing countries. Despite \\nbeing a developing country, the scheme was preferred by 36% of the \\nVietnamese respondents (the most-preferred scheme) in a Vietnamese \\nstudy (Nguyen et al., 2021). The flow of e-waste can be streamlined \\nunder this system by establishing testing facilities and maintenance \\ncenters for R&R, by which reclaimed products can be transferred to a \\nsocial organization for further use. Currently, a lack of legal incentives \\npromoting repairs and second-hand sales is considered a barrier to reuse \\npractice (Bovea et al., 2017). Kahhat et al. (2008) proposed a \\ndeposit-refund system based on radio-frequency identification device \\n(RFID). \\n5.1.3. Infrastructure development \\nWang et al. (2011) found that the availability of collection and \\nrecycling services to consumers significantly affect their awareness \\nlevels. Without proper collection and recycling facilities, it is hard to \\nimplement a (formalized) EMS (Liu et al., 2019). Construction and \\nimprovement of e-waste recycling infrastructure are the first steps that \\ngovernments should take to foster increased collection and recycling \\nrates. Regional infrastructure development with the help of public \\nsupport has been found to be particularly vital (Nowakowski, 2019), \\nwith a need for governments to subsidize investments in necessary fa-\\ncilities. Special collection events for small and IT equipment could be \\narranged. Permanent collection points and event collection in highly \\npopulated areas could be established (Fraige et al., 2012). An active \\nmonitoring system identifying e-waste flows in various final disposal \\npoints needs to be investigated by the waste management authorities \\nand other stakeholders through collaboration and coordination mecha -\\nnisms. Overall, there is a clear need to bridge the information supplied to \\nconsumers regarding formal collection and recycling facilities and local \\nrecycling infrastructure development for enhancing consumers’ level of \\nawareness. \\n5.1.4. Legislation and regulatory interventions \\nPolicy formulation should be focused more on consumers’ attitudes \\ntowards e-waste, with the behavioral insights provided by the reviewed \\nstudies used to inform government regulations and programs. To in-\\ncrease awareness around national e-waste recovery programs, it is \\nimportant to consider age, household size, income, gender, and educa -\\ntion level. EPR implementation with government and non-government \\norganizations (NGOs) should be given more attention. In most in-\\nstances, existing e-waste-related regulation was found to be weak and \\ndid not reflect consumers’ economic perspectives. The imposition of \\npenalties for improper disposal were also suggested by study authors \\nand making consumers responsible at the collection stage was found \\ncrucial. In most of the cases, consumers from developing countries \\ndemanded price incentives (at the time of disposal due to the presence of \\ninformal collectors), and subsidy amounts that can motivate consumers \\nto choose formal collection facilities need careful attention. In connec -\\ntion to this, regulatory reform and legally-binding provisions that make \\nconsumers more responsible for overall EM should be considered. In-\\ncentives to informal sector e-waste collectors also need to be provided \\nfor efficient and environmentally responsible recycling (Lau et al., \\n2013). \\nAdvanced recycling fees (ARFs) mandated in e-waste-specific regu-\\nlations are an option for mediating consumers’ disposal habits. Although \\nARFs were identified by a majority of articles as a burden for consumers, \\nif legal obligations bound consumers to pay the fee (in the form of ARF \\nor recycling fees at the time of disposal). Implementing ARFs through \\nproduct pricing was also found to eliminate economic bottlenecks in an \\nEMS in Switzerland (Islam et al., 2018). Extended producer responsibility (EPR) implementation in devel -\\noping nations is particularly challenging as it imposes a cost on con-\\nsumers (Dwivedy and Mittal, 2013). The prospect of EPR as a mandatory \\nprogram needs further attention from policymakers, which will even-\\ntually restrict illegal imports and informal sector downstream recycling \\nprocess. As EPR holds manufacturers and producers accountable for \\nsustainable product lifecycle management, two of the indicators (of \\nproduct design) - product durability (quality) and product \\nlifespan-should be directly interlinked with the EPR policy agenda. \\nOfficial take-back schemes through a compulsory retailer-based collec -\\ntion system should be considered further, as voluntary schemes often fail \\nto ensure widespread public participation (Blake et al., 2019). \\nIncreasing awareness among consumers is one of the fundamental \\ntasks of any C&RS. A lack of information regarding collection centers’ \\nexistence and locations was found to be a barrier to a CE for e-waste, \\nhighlighting the need for a greater focus on increasing consumer \\nawareness in national policy planning. Milovantseva (2016) argues that \\npublic support for green product design regulations can increase their \\nlikelihood of adoption by governments. Emphasis should also be placed \\non providing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with incentives and \\nsubsidies that encourage green entrepreneurship for product design and \\ndevelopment of local recycling facilities. \\nTechnology transfer for implementing EPR-related initiatives should \\nbe included in regional development planning. Training and capacity \\nbuilding of formal recycling sector stakeholders need to improve. \\nDwivedy and Mittal (2013) mention that market mechanisms fail within \\ncurrent EMSs due to externalities (informal sector in developing coun-\\ntries). Innovative financing mechanisms need to be established for \\nsetting up infrastructure in developing countries and internationaliza -\\ntion of recycling law is needed in the light of EU WEEE Directive and \\nEPR. The CE package initiated by the EU could be an example for pol-\\nicymakers in developing countries. \\n5.2. Business model innovation \\nBusiness model innovation is a critical aspect of a circular economy \\n(Pieroni et al., 2019). In this subsection, based on the in-depth literature \\nanalysis presented in Section 4, product design, secondhand product and \\nsupply chain, reverse logistics service provider, online markets and data \\nmanagement for e-waste generation, mobile applications, and social \\nmedia and finally, charity organizations and retailer \\ncoordination-related issues were discussed. \\n5.2.1. Product design \\nAccording to Chuang and Liao (2018), \"there is a pressing need to \\nunderstand cultural differences in behaviors, particularly in the context \\nof designing less resource-intensive products and services.\" Under -\\nstanding consumers’ engagement with EEE is vital to product design, \\nespecially as the reviewed studies show that psychological undesirabil -\\nity has far more effect than technological obsolescence on consumer \\nbehavior. Furthermore, it is seen that most of the consumers (regardless \\nof the country) tended to save old EEE for spare parts, creating oppor -\\ntunities for modular product design and simple repairability using a \\nuser-friendly instruction (e.g., diagrams/process figures). In most cases, \\nproduct user manuals provide information on product use with limited \\ntroubleshooting information or repair instructions. Supply of spare parts \\nand repair service availability are interrelated, and products and parts \\nmanufacturers should focus on this issue during product design. Aspects \\nsuch as material use (recycled or virgin materials), product lifespan \\nrelated data (date of manufacturing, expected expiry date, years of \\nservice guarantee), visible e-waste logo, and RFID based product \\ntracking system (to include recycling fees, monitor at the recycling \\ncenters/improper disposal) should be integrated with product design for \\nsustainable EM planning. According to Dindarian et al. (2012), there are \\nhardly any incentive available for designing products that facilitate \\nreuse. M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n255.2.2. Secondhand product and supply chain \\nThe growing secondhand product market is evident worldwide, \\nprimarily involving online product selling platforms such as eBay and \\nGumtree (in Australia). Oversight of this market by central authorities is \\nneeded to support local business and achieve consumers’ trust in used \\nproducts. Service guarantee and quality assurance could be the key to a \\nthriving used product market that integrate e-waste recycling services. \\nThe benefits of secondhand product purchase and use, and secondhand \\nproduct stores and outlets should be considered by service providers. \\nIncentive-supported modular repair service for WMPs could vastly \\nreduce rapid product replacement. \\n5.2.3. Reverse logistics service provider \\nEconomic incentives given to consumers in the form of collection \\nprice could form an integral part of the reverse logistic (RL) service \\nmodel. The responsibilities of service providers are multifaced, \\nincluding determining the appropriate mode of compensation, and \\nensuring that services are convenient to users. The cost of recycling is an \\nimportant aspect that should be visible (collected at the product pur-\\nchase point). RL service providers must ensure the transparency of the \\nprocess, and necessary policy and regulation should be formulated to \\nsupport regular operation and maintain continuous consumer satisfac -\\ntion. Telephone reservation and direct communication with the RL \\nservice provider would further enhance the product return process, with \\nconsumers preferring government-supported RL service providers for \\nreasons of accountability (Park et al., 2019). \\nRL service providers may use the existing network of waste collection \\nauthorities (municipal council collection), and in this process, they can \\neducate consumers and increase awareness. In this way, consumers’ pro- \\nenvironmental behavior could be further enhanced. Local government \\ncan play a critical role in enhancing public relations activities around e- \\nwaste collection, (Islam and Huda, 2020a), especially for WMPs. Infor-\\nmation dissemination should be considered an essential operational \\nactivity for both local government and service provider. Campaigns \\nfocused on product lifespan with incentives could be organized to cap-\\nture high-value materials from stored or unused items (e.g., MPs). \\nIn collecting SE e-waste, opportunities exist for new small businesses \\nto be developed around modular e-waste collection that, integrate OFN, \\nexchange offers, and cash/coupon arrangements (in the case of revers -\\nible items). Subjective norms have been found to be critical to e-waste \\nrecycling, and RL service providers (both government-operated and \\nprivately-owned under government regulation) could significantly \\nmediate behavioral intentions. This has the potential to reduce mobile \\nphone storage, which has become a social norm. RL service providers \\ncould be standardized through certification (by government de-\\npartments) to maintain the quality of e-waste collectors, including ca-\\npacity to deliver repair services specific products. \\nReliability and accessibility of service (e.g., number of collection \\npoints) was found to be critical in the articles reviewed. Generally, \\npopulation centers should be targeted (Qu et al., 2019), potentially \\nincluding retail stores (in the form of a drop-off bins), mobile network \\nservice providers’ outlets (for WMP collection), libraries, supermarkets \\n(dedicated areas for electronics stores). The service provision of reverse \\nlogistics arrangements should assess reasonable distance, ensuring \\ncollection points at the centers. Free mail-back service with incentives \\ncould also help to collect e-waste, especially for small e-waste items, as \\nconsumers are more concerned about service time and rewards from the \\ncollection channel. A flexible door-to-door collection could be estab -\\nlished based on mobile apps and telephone reservations. Young con-\\nsumers should be particularly encouraged to use online platforms for \\ne-waste recycling. Partnering with informal sector collectors could help \\nexpand the collection network. Government support and policy initia -\\ntives are mainly required for this instance, especially providing in-\\ncentives (Dwivedy and Mittal, 2013). On the other hand, establishing \\nrelationship with charity and secondhand product stores and businesses \\nwould bypass product flows that are generally destined for recycling only. In this aspect, consumers’ perceived behavioral control-related \\nissues should be closely observed, particularly any changes in recy-\\ncling behavior in the presence of a government-supported RL service \\nprovider. \\n5.2.4. Online markets and data management for EG \\nMore products are now being sold online than ever before, and in the \\nrecent COVID-19 pandemic, sales of electronic products have been \\nskyrocketing (World Economic Forum, 2020). Simultaneously, the on-\\nline market - both new product sales and second-hand market, should be \\nconsidered an essential element of product life management. For this \\ncase, the use of internet-of-things (IoT), “big data analytics” for \\ncombining socio-economic data with the distribution of waste across a \\ngeographical location, and blockchain technology could provide new \\ninsights on consumption habits. Zhang, B. et al. (2019) previously \\nmentioned the impact on big data in e-commerce sites (associated with \\nconsumption modes) and e-waste recycling services (Cao et al., 2018). \\nurged to examine effect of blockchain technology on transportation, \\nmaterial flow, and payment for WEEE collection modes. Improved data \\nquality on EoL product (specially e-waste) traceability is critical for a \\nformal e-waste collection system (Qu et al., 2019). The importance of \\ndata-oriented product labeling was found by several researchers, for \\nexample, research by Bovea, M.D. et al. (2018) and Huang et al. (2006). \\nMajor indicators of e-waste generation levels include device replace -\\nment rates, poor repairability, growing segment of consumer for elec-\\ntronic products and rapid development of electronic product (Arain \\net al., 2020). At household level, Fraige et al. (2012) mentioned about \\ntwo indicators - household device penetration rates, and products’ ser-\\nvice life. Data can be collected on product lifespan by identifying the \\ndate of manufacturing and when consumers posted an advertisement for \\na product. This way, firsthand product use characteristics (life-\\nspan-related data) could be gathered and utilized by applying various \\nstatistical models, such as the Weibull-distribution-based sales- -\\nstock-lifespan model. \\n5.2.5. Mobile applications and social media \\nThe use of technology, especially mobile apps, to support behavioral \\nchange is increasingly considered a useful tool to reduce e-waste (Kang \\net al., 2020). Although platforms such as Love Recycling, Taolv, \\nHaoshou, and Baidu have already become popular platforms (Wang \\net al., 2019), broader service coverage is required for this effort. Further \\nattention is also required around standardized price-setting and service \\ninnovation (for persons over 60 years of age). Government intervention \\nis required for online/internet-based collection platforms for e-waste \\ncollection and recycling, as concerns over privacy are critical. These \\nservices should be expanded not only for waste MP but also for other \\ne-waste items. Promoting the platform to rural and remote areas is \\nanother key task, which could be developed using optimized artificial \\nintelligence (AI) algorithms. Using AI algorithms, such as simulated \\nannealing, tabu search, greedy, bee colony optimization, Nowakowski \\net al. (2018) simulated e-waste collection requests. Jiang et al. (2021) \\nintegrated IoT and subscription accounts on social media platforms for \\nhousehold waste management. Providing substantial incentives and \\ntraining to local formal collectors should be considered in a smart EMS. \\n5.2.6. Charity organization and retailer coordination \\nMany used products flow to charity organizations after initial prod-\\nuct use. The most viable donation organizations are a charity and local \\nschools (Gupta and Kumar, 2014), where product reuse is often signif -\\nicantly higher than for other niche consumer segments. For example, \\nKahhat and Williams (2012) found that 60% of computers donated to \\ncharitable organizations were reused. This shows that there is a sec-\\nondary product market (other than the conventional online EEE \\nselling-buying platforms), which requires specific attention. There is an \\nopportunity for charity organizations to provide repair services at a \\nlarger scale, creating jobs in local communities (Islam and Huda, M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n262020c ). Technical, financial, and physical support from government, \\nbusiness and philanthropic organizations is needed to support the op-\\nerations of charitable organizations. Donation sites and information \\ncampaigns on product reuse could be organized at schools and offices of \\nsocial service providers. \\nAn integrated approach could be adopted that incorporates EEE re-\\ntailers, whereby consumer might buy secondhand refurbished products \\nfrom retailers (repaired by charity organizations), alongside new \\nequipment (Islam and Huda, 2020b ). In that case, certification and \\nquality assurance would be required to achieve consumer trust and \\nacceptability. Retailers should be provided the necessary infrastructure \\nsupport to collect disposed items by consumers, and retailers might \\nprovide cash/incentives to consumers. Establishing optimized collection \\npoints for repair services and setting standardized repair price also \\nrequire further attention. Secondhand product circulation will be suc-\\ncessful if retailers, manufacturers, service providers, governments, and \\ncharity organizations work together. \\n5.3. Analysis of research gap and future research directions \\nAfter reviewing 109 articles in this work, several research gaps were \\nidentified and analyzed in detail. These are discussed below to address \\nthe requirement of RQ2 around the potential for further research \\nstudies:  \\n•Apart from China and India, the number of studies that have been \\nperformed on consumer beahvior around e-waste in developing \\ncountries is limited and requires further attention (as per Fig. 3). \\nGermany is also a gap, with only one paper identified despite it being \\none of the largest e-waste generating nations globally (Islam et al., \\n2020b ). It is understood that German EM is well developed; however, \\ninvestigation on consumers ’ repair and reuse, and storage behavior \\nwould substantially provide insight for other developed nations, \\nwhich is currently missing in the academic research.  \\n•Through the policy and business model innovation discussed in \\nsection 5.1 and in section 5.2, respectively, there is an opportunity to \\nstudy changes in consumers ’ behavior over time (before and after \\ninterventions are implemented).  \\n•Consumers from so-called innovative sities (highly IT enabled cities \\nor cities with high tech companies present) should be investigated \\nfurther. This was revealed as a key research opportunity in this re-\\nview, with a potential list of cities prvided by Leskin (2018) . This also \\nsupports the call from Borthakur and Govind (2019) for \"more \\nlocale-specific\" studies to understand the dynamic behavior of \\ne-waste disposal and awareness across nations. \\n•Consumer behavior across product categories needs further atten -\\ntion. For example, disposal behavior for SE and LE category is \\nentirely different. As such, how consumers act for spercific products \\n(e.g., DVD player vs. refrigerator) or for specific groups of products \\n(e.g., SE vs. LE) require investigation. Through this, potential \\nimprovement opportunities could be identified for specific types of \\nproducts.  \\n•There is a clear opportunity for researchers to further investigate \\nconsumer consensus around ARF systems. In some studies, the WTP \\namount was investigated but the desired amount of incentives (cash \\nor any other method) that consumers required was not investigated. \\nFurthermore, WTP-related studies should focus more on imple -\\nmenting analytical methodologies such as analytical hierarchy pro-\\ncess (AHP), analytical network process (ANP), and conjoint analysis. \\nIn responding to WTP-related questions in a survey, pictoral repre -\\nsentations of e-waste collection and recycling services could be \\nprovided to deliver information to consumers about their roles and \\nresponsibilities (financial and physical). \\n•The economic benefits of internet or online-based system from con-\\nsumers ’ perspective require future research. In this regard, identi -\\nfying flows of e-waste would be a key first step, and implementing material flow analysis (MFA) models would be beneficial. MFA is \\ncapable of quantifying which platforms are profitable (traditional vs. \\nonline collection) considering all the actors (e.g., government, con-\\nsumers, network platforms, processing facilities) in the RL supply \\nchain (Islam and Huda, 2018a ).  \\n•Most of the studies reviewed were focused on the individual and \\nhousehold-level. Specific attention should be given to other con-\\nsumers such as government offices, higher education institutions, \\nand large multi-national companies. Technological companies \\nshould be future study areas, as mentioned by Fraige et al. (2012) . \\n•This study identified that a smaller number of studies were con-\\nducted considering the young population, more specifically, students \\nstudying at the universities. Future studies should focus on this group \\nof people as it is also found from the articles that this group ’s \\npossession rate in some of the EEE is higher than the general popu -\\nlation, indicating that different social norms may apply to this group.  \\n•Close attention is required around product return management \\nthrough follow-up research into, for example, the funding mecha -\\nnisms needed for informal collectors, price setting for various types \\nof e-waste (dedicated to consumers), and the role of various stake -\\nholders in the development of facilities.  \\n•Wang et al. (2011) found that substantial differences exist in term of \\ne-waste storage behavior among homeowners and renters in China. \\nFuture research should target these two groups of residents and \\ninvestigate their e-waste disposal and recycling behavior, including \\nin other countries. Furthermore, the authors found that income and \\nlevel of education were not significant predictors for the group, so \\nbetter statistical aspects considering other socio-economic variables \\nsuch as the number of families in the households, the number of \\nchildren need to be considered. Echegaray and Hansstein (2017) \\nmentioned that high-income group adequately dispose of e-waste in \\nappropriate channels in Brazil. However, it is necessary to under -\\nstand why low-income residents are not involved in recycling and \\ntheir potential demand for such services, including in other devel -\\noping countries.  \\n•As cheaper products tend to have shorter lifespans, product design \\ncharacteristics need to be investigated further. By analyzing samples \\nacross a range of products, a bill of materials (BoM) could be \\ndeveloped, and essential design modifications (cost and quality \\nefficient products) could be identified by engaging YUSs. Babbitt \\net al. (2020) recently applied BoM for collecting disassembly prop-\\nerties of EEE. \\n•Consumers ’ eco-friendly behavior remains until the product pur-\\nchase, but is diminished in the use-phase, and at the EoL phase. \\nFuture research should identify the reasons for such practices \\nfocusing on product design, environmental labeling, and other fac-\\ntors. Echegaray and Hansstein (2017) mentioned that e-waste is not \\nseen as a recyclable item as compared to other recyclable items such \\nas paper, plastics, and others. “Why consumers do not consider \\ne-waste as recyclable items?\" is an open research question.  \\n•According to Borthakur and Govind (2019) , e-waste-related studies \\nare now being conducted mostly from natural/applied science dis-\\nciplines. An interdisciplinary approach is required in understanding \\nconsumers ’ behavior towards e-waste from social science and policy \\nresearch areas. A holistic techno-economic perspective (considering \\nengineering perspective and social changes) needs to develop within \\nthe field of research (Awasthi and Li, 2018 ).  \\n•The introduction of internet-based collection systems has created an \\nintegrated cyber-physical space in which EM occurs, with Cao et al. \\n(2018) proposing that block-chain technology could be applied in \\ntransportation and payment in the online e-waste collection system. \\nThis platform can collect data on annual EEE production, sales, \\nrecycling amount of e-waste, and these data can be used as valuable \\ninputs for future policy formulation. IT is one of the emerging \\nresearch areas that requires considerable attention. M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n27•Regarding online collection systems and formal recycling platforms, \\nfurther research is needed into participant perceptions, especially for \\nlow-income and low-education participants. For older people, the \\nscope, and service innovations required for internet-based recycling \\nplatforms requires further attention. Apart from MPs, there is a \\nknowledge gap around how consumers dispose of their other e-waste \\nitems in the collection channels. Estimating acceptable collection \\nprices (as per consumer demand) also requires further investigation. \\n•Cross-cultural studies are required to understand consumers ’ de-\\nmand for specific e-waste collection options (door-to-door, council \\npickup, permanent collection points, online-based system), and the \\nassociated need for incentives. For example, do citizens from China \\nintend to behave the same when they emigrate to developed coun-\\ntries such as the USA, Australia, or Canada? How do cultural dif-\\nferences affect e-waste related consumer behavior (e.g., local people \\nvs. immigrants)?  \\n•Few studies were found that had been performed on R&R behavior. \\nFurther investigations are required into consumer perceptions of this \\nissue and local government policy on the topic (e.g., how local waste \\ncollection authorities engage consumers with repair shops and \\ncharity organizations). Major inhibitors need to be investigated \\nfurther from developed countries ’ contexts.  \\n•Financing mechanisms for deposit-return systems is a research gap, \\nthat requires further investigation. The mechanism ’s impact on the \\nonline-based collection platforms and retailer-based collection needs \\nspecial attention to identify optimal exchange offers for consumers. \\nMPs and other small IT and equipment require further consideration \\nin this regard.  \\n•According to Wang et al. (2011) , the most critical factors attributed \\nto using appropriate recovery channels are recycling habits, eco-\\nnomic benefits, the convenience of recycling facilities and services, \\nand residential conditions. These aspects need to be considered \\nfurther for urban areas in developed countries. It is assumed that \\nmost consumers feel reluctant to dispose of e-waste through formal \\ncollection and recycling channels due to the considerable amount of \\ntime involved.  \\n•TPB was found to be one of the most widely utilized methods on the \\nresearch topic. Future research should pay attention to the large \\npopulation size, and source, more representative samples from rural \\nand urban populations. Face-to-face interviews should be used more \\noften to understand other consumer behavior dimensions, as this was \\nperformed in only a limited number of studies. In addition, it was \\nobserved that most of the studies applied TPB in the case of recycling \\nbehavior (as seen in Table A2 in the appendix), leaving further op-\\nportunities to assess consumers ’ consumption, reuse, and repair and \\nstorage behavior. In the case of CB, TPB application could observe \\nconnection with recycling intention, especially for products which \\nare environmentally-friendly or designed under theoretical concepts \\nsuch as green phones or green vacuum cleaners. Product-focused \\ncase studies involving TPB are also limited, as it was observed that \\nrecycling and disposal behavior is largely associated with the prod-\\nuct type and category. Solar PV panels will be an emerging e-waste \\nstream (Islam et al., 2020c ). Various valuable and toxic materials are \\npresent in the panels (Mahmoudi et al., 2019 ). In that case, TPB \\napplication would provide a broader understanding of consumers ’ \\nconsumption and recycling behavior. Moreover, other constructs (of \\nTPB) might be considered in consumption-related issues, such as \\nproduct design, repairability, availability of recycling-oriented ser-\\nvice (in a take-back system) connected with a product purchase, \\nincentives, and disposal convenience. Nduneseokwu et al. (2017) \\nmentioned that case-specific variable integration, such as situational \\nfactors, psychological factors, and eco-friendly values, could be in-\\ntegrated into an extended TPB model. These factors could be added \\nby investigating possible interrelations between multiple behaviors \\nat once, such as storage and repair and reuse. The general TPB \\nconstructs were not assessed for secondhand product purchase, and in the future, researchers should identify the factors associated with \\nthe consumers ’ reuse behavior. For example, do peer-pressure and \\nsocial norms affect the R&R behavior? These issues were not \\nextensively analyzed and need further attention. The impact/influ -\\nence of TPB application among the participants could be observed \\nover time (same number of samples after implementing intervention \\nand observe the change of intentions).  \\n•Consumer preferences for retailer-based collection points for e-waste \\ndisposal require further attention. EU WEEE Directive places a spe-\\ncific focus on retailer-based collection (Directive, 2012 ). Improving \\nWMP collection channels and residents ’ environmental awareness is \\none of the future research areas (Zhang, Y. et al., 2019 ).  \\n•Computer and IT-related equipment were found as dominant product \\ncategories. Future research should obtain specific data (via a survey) \\non lifespan profile that eventually will help estimate EG for each \\ncategory within a given region. Urban mining is an essential aspect \\nthat connects with this idea, and policymakers can identify oppor -\\ntunities for improvement in future policy planning from the studies. \\n6.Conclusion \\nIn this comprehensive literature review article, consumers ’ behav -\\niors and awareness regarding e-waste were thoroughly reviewed by \\nanalyzing 109 articles published in international peer-reviewed jour-\\nnals. The studies were categorized according to various behavioral as-\\npects, such as consumption, repair and reuse, storage, disposal, and \\nrecycling. Finally, the article proposed a consumer-centric circular \\neconomy framework that indicates necessary policy initiatives and \\nbusiness model innovation opportunities towards attaining a circular \\neconomy (CE) in academic research focusing on e-waste. \\nOne of the critical research findings is that consumers are demanding \\na substantial change in existing e-waste management systems. Issues \\nrequiring the attention of researchers and policymakers around both \\nproduct and service innovation include formal e-waste collection op-\\ntions, data and information security, collection prices, modes of \\ncompensation, service options (online, door-to-door, curbside collec -\\ntion, proximity to permanent recycling centers), confidence and \\nparticipation in online recycling platforms, and low-cost repair. \\nConsumers ’ awareness regarding e-waste should be raised through \\neducation and campaigns. More diversified strategies involving social \\nmedia and information provided at physical locations are required to \\nhave an impact on consumers ’ storage and repair and reuse behavior. A \\nspecific focus is required on frequency and content development for \\nawareness-raising campaigns. Regulatory frameworks require further \\nattention in relation to informal sector recycling, extended producer \\nresponsibility, payment size and method in take-back systems, public \\nengagement provision, and mandatory product stewardship schemes. In \\ndeveloping a national EM policy, regional aspects and city-wide socio -\\neconomic diversity should be considered, rather than implementing a \\none-size-fits-all solution. To achieve better material circularity, gov-\\nernment support through tax relief and subsidies should be provided to \\nlocal recycling companies and cooperation should be established be-\\ntween electronic product manufacturers and local waste management \\nauthorities. \\nManufacturers have a role to play in the product end-of-life stage and \\nthe product design stage to enhance consumer perceptions of convenient \\nproduct disassembly (for recycling) and enhanced repairability. Online \\nproduct selling and exchange sites play a critical role in influencing \\nconsumption behavior. In that regard, the government can develop a \\nnational inventory database on (category-wise) product sales and (sta-\\ntistical) parameter identification for waste generation estimation. Con-\\nsumers ’ selling behavior and its impact on manufacturers ’ reverse \\nlogistics operations should be considered a research opportunity. Ser-\\nvice innovation in e-waste collection for the aged population and the \\ncase of small e-waste items should have a particular focus. \\nDespite the complex interdisciplinary nature of the research, this M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316 (2021) 128297\\n28paper provides an introductory guide to researchers investigating \\nseveral issues in one single place. Most importantly, it is often hard to \\nprovide a generalized recommendation linking circular economy prin-\\nciples (building blocks) and associated pathways as socio-economic \\nconditions, policy, and regulation are both country and culture spe-\\ncific. In this case, a more interdisciplinary research approach could be \\ntaken by future researchers in the field. \\nA global focus on consumer awareness and behavior towards e-waste \\nhas been considered in this review article, collecting, and analyzing \\narticles published in the international peer-reviewed journals. As the \\nfocus topic encompasses an interdisciplinary field of research, if any \\npaper missed the WoS database keywords, it might not appear in the \\ncollection and would not have been included in the analysis. Future \\nresearch should utilize other keywords and integrating other search \\nengines such as scholar.google.com. Extending the literature review to \\njournals in other languages may address some of these gaps, but lan-\\nguage barriers could also create difficulties around researchers learning \\nfrom other nations’ experiences. \\nIt is hoped that this paper will have value for policymakers in \\ndeveloping strategies and for researchers in conducting future research \\ninto the multidimensional research theme of advancing knowledge \\naround e-waste and circular economy. For future research, an interdis -\\nciplinary approach is required that seeks to understand the complex \\ndynamics of consumer behavior including how it varies across different \\nproducts and waste streams.

In this turbulent era, there is a need for resilience at every level—from the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We argue that achieving resilience will require both enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to these chal-lenges. Such practical first steps can serve as models for creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in India. One way to stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials, thus seeking to eliminate waste. Previous research has shown that such initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community resilience, while stimulating the regional economy. An international conference on Waste Management Innovation, held in 2017 in Mumbai with funding from the US Consulate General, resulted in the award of seed grants to two Indian non-profits that sought to apply circular economy principles to regional communities—one urban and one rural. These initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation. The World Institute of Sustainable Energy has developed an action plan to capture at least 60 percent of the electronic waste generated in the city of Pune, one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. Their approach is based on circular economy principles, and has been embraced in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents and non-governmental organizations. Barefoot College has established and demonstrated a low-cost, end-to-end solid waste management model for rural villages that is designed by the local community. Their unique approach ensures sanitation, environmental protection, income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. This paper presents the results of these two efforts, and suggests what lessons were learned. One overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is necessary to understand the interplay of economic, environmental, and social forces.\\n * Joseph Fiksel \\n fiksel.2@osu.edu\\n Praveena Sanjay \\n praveena.ccs@wisein.org\\n Kavya Raman \\n kavyaraman8@gmail.com\\n1 The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA\\n2 World Institute of\\xa0Sustainable Energy, Pune, Maharashtra, \\nIndia\\n3 Social Work and\\xa0Research Centre, Barefoot College, Tilonia, Rajasthan, India  J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\nGraphic abstract\\nKeywords Resilience\\xa0· Waste\\xa0· Circular economy\\xa0· Sustainable development\\xa0· Systems thinking\\xa0· India\\nAbbreviations\\nCPCB  Central Pollution Control Board\\nCSO  Civil Society Organization\\nMeitY  Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\\nMoEFCC  Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change\\nMPCB  Maharashtra Pollution Control Board\\nNGO  Non-governmental OrganizationNGT  National Green Tribunal\\nPMC  Pune Municipal Corporation\\nPRO  Producer Responsibility Organization\\nSDGs  Sustainable Development Goals\\nThe need for\\xa0resilience\\nIn recent years, the rapid growth of the Indian economy has been accompanied by an array of social and environmental stress factors, including population growth, political strife, rapid urbanization, food and water scarcity, environmental pollution, and climate change. By 2050, half of India’s popu-lation will live in cities, and municipal solid waste volume is expected to triple to about 436 million metric tons (MT) (Lal 2013). While India has committed to the UN Sustain-\\nable Development Goals (SDGs), termed the Agenda 2030 (U.N. 2015), progress is hampered by haphazard urban \\ndevelopment and ineffective regulatory controls. Moreover, the focus on long-term sustainability is often trumped by social and political turbulence, as well as unexpected dis-ruptions such as terrorism, industrial accidents and extreme weather events. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the health and safety of India’s diverse population, as well as to India’s burgeoning economy. Unfor -\\ntunately, the adverse impacts of these stress factors will dis-proportionately affect the informal sectors of the economy where hundreds of millions of lower-caste workers struggle to support themselves and their families.\\nIn this time of disruptive change, there is a clear need \\nfor resilience at every level—from the peasant family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We define resilience as “the capacity for a system to survive, adapt, and flourish in the face of turbulent change and uncertainty” (Fiksel 2015). In the context of economic development, the \\n“system” is extremely complex, since it involves produc-ers, supply chains, consumers, waste handlers, regulators, and non-governmental organizations that may be located in different geographic zones. Moreover, a true systems view must consider the social and environmental consequences of remaining in the current state, the potential benefits to vari-ous stakeholders of proposed adaptations, and the accom-panying uncertainties.\\nResilience is often confounded with sustainability. The \\ntwo concepts are closely related, but quite different in scope and time scale. Sustainability represents a long-term view, considering how decisions that we make today will influence  Steps toward\\xa0a\\xa0resilient circular economy in\\xa0India  \\n1 3\\nthe well-being of both present and future generations. It is \\nbased on an idealistic view of productive harmony between humans and the environment. Resilience is a more prag -\\nmatic, real-time concept—considering how to overcome unexpected disruptions while building an organization or community that embraces change.\\nGenerally speaking, we can say that a sustainable system \\nis more resilient to disruptions and a resilient system is more sustainable in the long run. In other words, sustainability and resilience are distinct but mutually reinforcing. However, sustainability and resilience may not always be synergistic. There are situations where sustainability and resilience are opposing rather than reinforcing. For example, by storing backup supplies, a company may improve business conti-nuity but this also increases the environmental footprint. In the Indian context, we argue that both resilience and sus-tainability can be achieved by a combination of enlightened government policies based on systems thinking, as well as successful initiatives by social and environmental innova-tors. These practical first steps can serve as models to be replicated, thus defining a path forward toward a resilient and sustainable Indian economy.\\nWaste management challenges in\\xa0India\\nFor purposes of achieving both sustainability and resilience, a critical area that must be addressed in India is the man-agement of municipal, industrial and agricultural wastes in both urban and rural areas. As of 2016, urban areas in India, representing about 377 million people, generated 62 mil-lion MT of municipal solid waste each year. Of this, only about 70% are collected due to insufficient municipal ser -\\nvices. About 20% of the collected wastes are treated, and the remaining 50% are disposed in open landfills, without proper treatment or containment. Based on changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth, urban municipal solid waste generation is projected to reach 165 million MT by 2030. (India Environment Portal 2016).\\nIn rural areas, agricultural wastes including crop and \\nanimal residues are often burnt in the fields or used as tra-ditional household fuels. These practices have resulted in severe pollution of air, soil and water, creating health prob-lems for both workers and nearby households. Recycling and composting programs are unable to keep pace with the growth of waste, although small startup companies and NGOs are introducing new solutions ranging from high-tech waste processing to improve training and support for waste picker communities (Fiksel and Lal 2018).\\nIn theory, much of this waste could be beneficially used \\nas renewable energy or materials. However, the challenges of modernizing waste collection, segregation, treatment and disposal are enormous. Following the establishment of the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Mission in 2014, a series of more stringent rules were issued in 2016 for solid waste management, including specific requirements for plas-tic wastes, electronic wastes, construction and demolition debris, biomedical wastes, and hazardous wastes. However, despite these regulatory efforts, the Indian economy will continue to generate growing waste streams due to increase in population, urbanization, crops and livestock, resulting in significant human health and environmental impacts.\\nFor India to achieve continued economic growth, poverty \\nalleviation, hunger elimination, human development, and environmental improvement, new transformative solutions are needed rather than incremental improvements. Beyond the obvious concerns about waste proliferation, improved waste management is important for controlling a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs)—methane emissions from landfills, as well as nitrous oxide and methane from agricultural waste combustion. Moreover, material through-put is a major driver of GHG emissions, and hence waste reduction will significantly decrease energy and material demand and the associated GHG emissions throughout global supply chains (Fiksel 2011).\\nThis paper describes the results of a conference on Waste \\nManagement Innovation held in Mumbai in April 2017, with the purpose of stimulating waste minimization strategies based on “circular economy” principles (OSU 2017). The conference was sponsored by the US Consulate in Mumbai, which offered seed grants to non-profit organizations for demonstration of innovative approaches. The accomplish-ments of two grantee organizations are described below—one in an urban context and the other in a rural context.\\nCircular economy opportunities\\nThe concept of “circular economy” as a strategy for waste elimination has been broadly adopted in the business world. Companies have sought to achieve “zero waste” by find-ing uses for discarded materials and closing the loop in their supply network. Circularity not only offers economic benefits and reduces a company’s ecological footprint, but also increases both business and community resilience by reducing dependence upon scarce resources and long-dis -\\ntance supply chains. The concept has been implemented by progressive business leaders as a cost-effective means of improving corporate sustainability and resilience (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017).\\nThe practice of circular economy requires a systems \\napproach that considers the broader economic, social and environmental systems in which commercial supply chains operate. Figure\\xa0 1 shows how a systems approach can be \\nused to model the generation and disposition of wastes throughout the business value chain; this approach is based   J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\non the triple value framework, which explicitly maps the \\ninterdependencies among three types of dynamic systems—industries, communities, and the environment (Fiksel et\\xa0al. 2014). Resources are extracted from the environment, move through production processes to create value for markets, and then the wastes are disposed or recycled. The lifecycle stages shown in Fig.\\xa0 1 include extraction of raw materials \\nfrom terrestrial sources, transport, processing, manufactur -\\ning and packaging into finished products, distribution and product support through various market channels, con-sumer use of products, and final disposal or recycling of the residual wastes. These wastes are generated in solid, liquid, and gaseous forms, and may include hazardous pollutants and greenhouse gases. In this type of holistic analysis, it is important to account for direct consequences, such as finan-cial benefits, as well as indirect or unintended consequences, including environmental and social impacts.\\nThe circular economy strategy envisions that industrial \\nand consumer wastes can replace virgin materials—so that inefficient and harmful waste disposal is essentially elimi -\\nnated. Many existing waste streams are underutilized; for example, municipal solid waste contains about 85% of bio-mass and other combustible materials, comprising a mixture of energy-rich fuels. Likewise, coal combustion residues from power plants, such as fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization residues, can be beneficially used in concrete and cement production, structural fills, building products, gypsum wallboard, and surface stabili-zation. The World Economic Forum estimates that based on current technologies, the circular economy approach could save more than $1 trillion/yr globally due to lower costs, lower carbon emissions, and supply chain risk reduction (WEF 2013). Circular economy practices include reverse \\nlogistics (eg., refurbishment of containers, pallets, used or defective products), beneficial reuse of wasted materials or energy (e.g., composting, used oil recovery, biodiges -\\ntion of organics, combined heat and power), and business model innovation (eg., dematerialization, resource pooling, product-as-a-service).\\nA particularly effective circular economy practice is \\ncalled by-product synergy (BPS), first introduced by the US Business Council for Sustainable Development and widely adopted by companies in diverse industries (Cimren et\\xa0al. 2010 ). By collaborating across industry lines, companies \\ncan avoid landfilling costs and reduce material procurement costs by converting industrial or municipal wastes into feed -\\nstocks for other industrial processes, thus turning waste into profit. This not only contributes to long-term sustainabil-ity by reducing a company’s ecological footprint, but also improves a company’s resilience by reducing dependence on imported supplies and scarce resources. BPS is by far the shortest and most efficient path to achieving a circular economy. Municipal waste recovery is much more resource-intensive, and in any case, municipal waste is only a small fraction of the total solid waste generated by industry.\\nMore broadly, taking a systems approach enables har -\\nmonization of industrial processes with natural processes, which provide industries with important ecosystem services such as flood control, pollutant absorption, and carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems such as soil, vegeta-tion and wetlands (Fiksel et\\xa0al. 2014). These services from \\nnature can mitigate climate change and air pollution, restore \\nFig. 1  A Systems View of Circular Economy Processes Steps toward\\xa0a\\xa0resilient circular economy in\\xa0India  \\n1 3\\nsoil health, enhance the quality and renewability of water \\nresources, and generally improve the environment. Today, many progressive companies are recognizing the importance of ecosystem services to ensure the resilience of their supply chains, and are pursuing resource efficiency together with end-of-life waste minimization, recovery, and reuse (Fiksel 2015).\\nCircular economy design should strive to be inclusive by \\nconsidering how management decisions may impact various stakeholder groups, including the poor and other underrep-resented segments of society that are especially vulnerable to the health impacts of waste proliferation. Stewardship of natural capital (i.e., ecological resources) and social capital (i.e., community solidarity) will help companies to achieve profitable waste reduction or avoidance in ways that not only benefit their shareholders and business partners but also earn the respect and appreciation of public stakeholders. Thus, judicious management of all waste sources (industrial, agri-cultural and municipal) can advance progress toward many of the UN SDGs. In particular, circular economy practices will contribute to Goal 12—environmentally sound man-agement of chemicals and wastes, including reduction in releases, and Goal 3—ensuring healthy lives and well-being, including reduction in deaths and illnesses due to environ-mental pollution.\\nIn the agricultural sector, best management practices \\nsuch as conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, and sustainable intensification, i.e., produc-ing more from less, can increase soil resilience and restore the carbon pool, providing multiple benefits—greenhouse gas sequestration, improved water quality and conserva -\\ntion, decreased nutrient loss, reduced soil erosion, greater crop yields, and food and nutritional security (Lal 2016). India generates an estimated 1.6\\xa0MMT per year of agri-cultural wastes, but a large proportion of these resources can be composted and used as soil amendments. With judicious use of chemical fertilizers, this would eliminate the nutrient deficit in agricultural soils while sequestering carbon and improving the health of soil, plants, animals, people and the environment. Agricultural wastes can also be utilized as industrial raw materials; for example, rice husk ash is a valuable industrial raw material for steel, cement, and refractory bricks, and can also be used for waste water treatment, thermal insulation, mortar and con-crete production, soil amendment, and silica production. Similarly, bagasse from sugarcane can be used to generate energy.\\nA recent Accenture study suggested that India can \\nunlock approximately half-a-trillion dollars of economic value by 2030 through adoption of Circular Economy busi-ness models. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 2, this could be achieved by \\na combination of strategies—reduction in wasted material and energy resources, improved utilization of products and capital assets, product life extension, and value recovery from waste streams.\\nFig. 2  Value Realization Potential from Circular Business Models by 2030 (Accenture 2019)  J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\nCase study: circular economy system \\nfor\\xa0urban electronic waste\\nThe World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) is a \\nnot-for-profit organization established in 2004, based in Pune, India. WISE is committed to the cause of promoting sustainable energy and sustainable development through the advancement of low-carbon, renewable, and energy efficient pathways that pave the way toward achieving the sustainability goals of energy security, livelihood security, and climate security. Mediating public policy through pro -\\nactive interventions is the prime objective of the Institute.\\nThis seed grant supported WISE’s efforts to engage \\nwith concerned stakeholders regarding the current elec-tronic waste (e-waste) management systems and practices in the city of Pune. The WISE team was able to identify the challenges and issues faced by the various stakeholder groups, including government authorities, civil society organizations, private entrepreneurs, citizens’ groups, waste-pickers, and household consumers. Based on these insights, WISE developed a comprehensive action plan that provides practical strategies to enable a circular econ-omy for urban e-waste management.\\nThe electrical and electronics market in India has grown \\nrapidly, and was projected to reach $400 billion by 2020 (ASSOCHAM 2018). However, rapid technological obsoles-\\ncence and increased consumer purchasing power have led a sharp increase in the generation of e-waste. India accounted for 2 million MT of global e-waste in 2016, ranking fourth in the world after China, the USA, and Japan. Within India, the state of Maharashtra accounted for the most e-waste genera-tion (about 20%). Pune is the cultural and educational capi-tal of Maharashtra, and one of the eight largest metropoli-tan cities in the country. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) estimated that the city generated around 16,000\\xa0MT of e-waste in 2016, of which only 8.64\\xa0MT was recycled.\\nRecognizing the urgent need for e-waste recycling, \\nWISE set out to conduct a detailed study of the challenges and gaps prevalent in Pune’s current e-waste management system. The objective of the study was to develop a plan for capturing at least 60 percent of e-waste generated in the next two years by enabling a circular economy system. The study methodology involved the following steps:\\nStep 1 Current scenario assessment\\nThe WISE team performed an assessment of the chal-\\nlenges, gaps, and issues present in the e-waste manage-\\nment system currently present in Pune city. This included:\\n• Assessment of the current practices and methods adopted by the stakeholders and analysis of their effectiveness at different levels—governance, technical, financial, etc.• Assessment of the circular economy framework for e-waste, both at the global and national level, with the objective of extrapolating best practices in the model e-waste framework for Pune city.\\n• Analysis of health and environmental risks associated with unscientific e-waste handling.\\n• Analysis of current e-waste management system and loss in value due to rudimentary techniques and improper handling of e-waste.\\nThe WISE team spent considerable effort to character -\\nize the e-waste regulatory regime and management prac-tices in India (see Fig.\\xa0 3). E-waste is primarily managed \\nby civil society organizations (CSOs) and the private sec-tor. Government legislation provides the framework for this process, and the 2018 E-waste Management Rules include Extended Producer Responsibility. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a statutory body under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), prepares guidelines for implementation of the e-waste rules by the respective State Pollution Con-trol Boards. For Pune, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is the state regulatory body responsible for granting and monitoring authorizations for e-waste man-agement. PMC is the urban civic body that governs Pune and is responsible for solid waste management in the city.\\nPMC currently has only a small e-waste cell. In the \\nabsence of appropriate guidelines, the role of the munici-pal corporation and the e-waste cell is not defined and there are no dedicated human resources for e-waste man-agement. While the PMC has designated 177 temporary centers for collection of e-waste in the city, there is an almost complete lack of awareness among citizens regard-ing these centers. This has resulted in the formal sector (comprising local NGOs and private organizations) taking up the responsibility of e-waste management in the city.\\nHowever, only a handful of formal e-waste collecting \\nand dismantling centers are currently functioning in Pune, and 95% of e-waste is managed by the informal sector (waste-pickers, known as kabadiwalas). WISE found that this group has a keen interest in being part of the formal chain and to work as licensed collectors, and expressed the need for regulatory initiatives to integrate them into the formal e-waste chain and assure them of healthy and secure work conditions.\\nIn summary, the following are the key findings of \\nWISE’s assessment of major gaps and challenges related to e-waste management in Pune City.\\n• The current mandate segregates only wet and dry waste. No guidelines exist for e-waste segregation and management. Steps toward\\xa0a\\xa0resilient circular economy in\\xa0India  \\n1 3\\n• There are no defined baseline targets, benchmarks or \\ntimelines for e-waste management.\\n• No monitoring and evaluation mechanism is in place, resulting in operational inefficiency at different stages of e-waste management.\\n• There is a lack of proper communication and coordina-tion among the key stakeholders, namely MPCB, PMC, and the formal sector, leading to ineffective e-waste gov -\\nernance and management.• Progress is inhibited by lack of appropriate infrastructure, capacity building, and information awareness, along with lack of funding and financial incentives for the formal sector.\\nStep 2 Action plan preparation\\nBased on the findings from the above assessments, \\nWISE proceeded to develop a Strategic Action Plan based \\nFig. 3  E-Waste Management Stakeholder Roles in India (derived from ASSOCHAM-EY 2019)  J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\non extensive engagement with key stakeholder groups. \\nThis plan includes:\\n• One-on-one discussions and roundtable meetings with stakeholders, comprising waste collectors, municipal authorities, NGOs, recyclers and dismantlers, estab-lished and non-established supply chain entities, and others.\\n• Separate interactions with domestic consumers to under -\\nstand their awareness levels and expectations.\\n• Development of an implementation strategy and corre-sponding Action Plan to be carried out over the short term (2\\xa0years) and long term (5\\xa0years) by the concerned stakeholders.\\nTable\\xa0 1 provides a detailed summary of the Strategic \\nAction Plan. (A list of acronyms used appears at the end of the paper).\\nStep 3 Knowledge dissemination\\nThe Action Plan was disseminated through a variety of \\nchannels including WISE and OSU websites, stakeholder \\nwebsites, email blasts, and social media. Additionally, focus group meetings were held to ensure the feasibility of plan implementation. The final report of the WISE project has met with wide acceptability among city officials and key stakeholders across the value chain. In particular, the WISE team briefed the Joint Municipal Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, PMC and other key stakeholders, and received an enthusiastic response (see Fig.\\xa0 4). It appears that the rec-\\nommended Strategic Action Plan can pave the way for more informed decisions by policy-makers and e-waste chain par -\\nticipants, leading to development of a circular economy in Pune.\\nThe following summarizes the strategic action recom -\\nmendations that were developed in this project.\\n• Draft guidelines for streamlining e-waste management in Pune; prescribe rules, regulations, and penalties, if any; define stakeholder roles, and integrate these into a circular economy framework.\\n• Conduct a baseline study to assess and evaluate the total consumption of resources in the electronics sector and the e-waste generated, thus enabling adoption of suit-able benchmarks and targets for reducing e-waste. Such a study would also be relevant for national-level targets.\\n• Develop a long-term resource efficiency strategy for Pune that would strive for a circular economy, reducing both virgin resource use by manufacturers and consumer con-sumption.\\n• Develop guidelines for mandating a certain percentage of recycled e-waste in manufacturing. This will enable strengthening of the formal e-waste sector (similar to the renewable purchase obligation that mandates a certain percentage of renewable energy in power purchases).\\n• Conduct impact assessment studies to analyze the health, environmental and economic impacts of improper e-waste recycling by the informal sector in Pune, and at a national level.\\n• Organize capacity building training programs and work -\\nshops (by PMC) for the formal and (especially) informal sectors, on the adverse health and environmental impacts of handling, dismantling, and recycling e-waste in an improper and unscientific manner.\\n• Develop appropriate business and financial models for a circular e-waste economy that would attract more fund-ing from private institutions into the electrical and elec-tronics sector.\\n• Undertake studies and organize conferences, seminars, community drives and workshops to educate citizens about the value of adopting a more sustainable lifestyle.\\n• Carry out feasibility studies for designing ‘product ser -\\nvice systems’ that would integrate products, services, supporting networks and infrastructure, to reduce waste and form a circular economy.\\n• Conduct research to facilitate adoption of the ‘cradle-to-cradle’ approach, transitioning from a resource-inten-sive to a resource-efficient economy that decouples the environmental footprint from economic prosperity and human well-being (i.e., doing more with less for longer).\\nCase study: waste management system \\nfor\\xa0rural villages\\nThe Social Work and Research Centre, widely known as \\nBarefoot College, is a voluntary organization founded by Bunker Roy in 1972. Full-time volunteers are working in the fields of education, skill development, health, drinking water, women empowerment and electrification through solar power for the upliftment of rural people.\\nRural areas of India present a different set of challenges \\nfrom those that exist in densely populated cities. In rural villages, there tends to be a lack of understanding of the importance of personal hygiene and proper waste disposal. The objective of this seed grant was to establish and dem-onstrate a low-cost, end-to-end rural solid waste manage -\\nment model that is designed by the local community. This model aims to ensure sanitation, environmental protection, and income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. Thus, the project not only addresses the UN SDGs mentioned earlier—responsible consumption and human health—but also contributes to poverty elimination (Goal 1), clean water (Goal 6), and sustainable communities (Goal 11).

Steps toward\\xa0a\\xa0resilient circular economy in\\xa0India  \\n1 3\\nThe village selected for this project was Nalu, near \\nthe campus of Barefoot College in the Ajmer district of \\nRajasthan. The population consists of approximately 660 families comprising a total of 3000 residents. The major occupations of these villagers include farming, animal husbandry, marble industry, firework factories. Many are employed as contract laborers, including work supported by the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by provid-ing at least 100\\xa0days of wage employment per year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.\\nDrinking water, electricity, education, and basic health \\nfacilities are available in the village. However, sanitation facilities and practices are notably deficient. Although 90% of the families have toilets, only about half of these families actually use their toilets. The rest practice open defecation in the fields, a traditional practice that they find more agreeable than being shut in a small room. Moreover, the community lacks any type of waste management system, so that most trash is simply burned or discarded in nearby fields.\\nBaseline survey In January 2019, a baseline survey was \\nconducted to understand the current knowledge, attitudes and practices of the community related to waste disposal and management. Each household in the village was visited to understand the general attitudes, and survey data were col-lected from 25% of the households. The survey results are shown in Fig.\\xa0 5. Key findings were as follows:\\n• Existing waste disposal system While organic waste and metals are largely disposed in a non-harmful manner (composting or selling), non-biodegradable waste mate-rials such as plastics, cloth, rubber are either dumped in the open or burned. These practices threaten the integrity of local soils and water bodies, and may endanger the health of both humans and grazing animals.\\n• Existing cleaning arrangements Members of the “sweeper community” are forced to clean villages for low and infrequent wages. They are a marginalized and oppressed group, treated as untouchables by the rest of the village, and are not allowed to engage in other liveli-hood activities.\\n• Interest in a waste management system All households agreed upon the need for a scientific waste management system and were prepared to support the system with a monthly contribution of Rs. 40 (about 60 cents) per household.\\n• Stakeholder involvement The local governance body (Panchayat), consisting of influential men and women from the community, was completely aligned with the \\nFig. 4  Joint Municipal Commissioner, PMC (Dnyaneshwar Molak, center) launches the WISE report on “Enabling a circular economy for \\nE-waste in Pune City” accompanied by stakeholders and WISE staff  J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\nidea of setting up a waste management system in the vil-\\nlage, and expressed support toward maintaining such a system.\\nSystem design Accordingly, the Barefoot College team \\nset out to design a low-cost, end-to-end rural solid waste management system with the participation of the village community, illustrated in Fig.\\xa0 6. The team estimated that \\nthe system would employ about 2 or 3 cleanliness work -\\ners per village, and that a supervisor would be appointed in each village. Once trained, the supervisor could most likely take responsibility for 3 or 4 neighboring villages in the region.\\nImplementation of this design in the village of Nalu was \\naccomplished by the fall of 2019, enabling the following key activities:\\n• Waste collection The cleanliness workers collect segre-gated waste from households every day. Waste is segre-gated into ‘Organic’, ‘Plastic and other recyclables’ and ‘Hazardous’ at the household level. Waste collection is accomplished using an electric-powered cart.\\nFig. 5  Percent of Nalu households following various disposal practices for different kinds of waste\\nFig. 6  Overview of the design and operation of a rural waste management system Steps toward\\xa0a\\xa0resilient circular economy in\\xa0India  \\n1 3\\n• Waste treatment All waste is transported to the recy -\\ncling facility for processing as follows:\\n(a) Organic waste is converted into nutrient-rich com-\\npost through a 3-month low-cost composting tech-nique.\\n(b) Recyclable waste is further segregated into plastic bottles, plastic food packaging, polyethylene bags, cloth, glass, rubber, metal, cardboard, and other materials. Each type of waste is stored separately and sold to recycling plants periodically.\\n(c) Bio-medical wastes such as sanitary pads, diapers, and blood-stained cloth are incinerated.\\n(d) Any other residual waste is sent to a sanitary land-fill. After implementation of this system, less than 5% of household waste is being sent to the land-fills.\\n(e) All the waste collected is weighed daily and docu-mented.\\n• Waste value recovery Compost and recyclable waste are sold and the revenue generated is reinvested into the system to offset operational cost. A service charge is also collected from the village residents to ensure long-term ownership of the system.\\nImplementation of this project proceeded through the \\nfollowing series of steps:\\nStep 1 Community sensitization\\nFebruary and March of 2019 were spent generating \\nawareness of the project and sensitizing the community \\nto the importance of waste management. Focus group dis -\\ncussions, mass awareness sessions using puppetry, house-hold-level awareness generation, and randomized aware-ness meetings were conducted to engage the villagers in dialogue and inform them about appropriate waste man-agement and source segregation methods. These activities included:\\n• Seven informal group discussions engaging 100 people\\n• Four ward level awareness presentations engaging 300 women\\n• One mass awareness puppet show engaging > 500 resi-\\ndents\\n• Two cleaning camps in the government school involving more than 250 students\\n• Sensitization workshops with a village youth group (12 members) and a group of local governance officials (nine members)\\nAs a result, almost every person in the village was made \\naware of the concept that was being introduced and was supportive of setting up a waste management system in the village.\\nStep 2 Leadership and commitment\\nIn March 2019, an all-female village committee was \\nformed to design, build and implement the waste man-\\nagement system. This approach ensures local relevance of the design as well as long-term sustainability and owner -\\nship of the system within the community. The committee mobilized residents to contribute money toward the waste management system, and was able to raise Rs 9600 (about $640) from the local governance (Gram Panchayat), and other influential village families.\\nStep 3 Recycling infrastructure.\\nDuring April 2019, the team focused on setting up \\nhousehold infrastructure to promote source segregation. \\nDiscarded oil cans were refurbished to create visually appealing and functional dustbins. In a period of one month, more than 1000\\xa0s-hand oil cans were washed, painted and marked with ‘Organic waste,’ ‘Plastic and other dry waste’ and ‘Hazardous waste.’ The bins were dis-tributed to 337 households as well as the shops, schools, and other publicly used spaces in the village. This activity had the following advantages:\\n• No new material was used to manufacture the dustbins, which served as a message to the community that old and discarded items can be refurbished into useful and attractive products\\n• The cost per dustbin was almost half of the price to pur -\\nchase new dustbins of similar quality\\n• Five local people were given employment for 2 to 3\\xa0weeks for preparation of the bins.\\nStep 4 Waste treatment infrastructure.\\nThe local governance body (Gram Panchayat) allocated \\nland to the organization to build waste management infra-structure. From April to June 2019, the land was leveled, cleared of bushes, fenced, and made ready for construction. Four compost pits and one segregation and storage unit were constructed to treat all the waste generated by the village.\\nStep 5 Village clean-up\\nFrom June to August 2019, two persons from the mar -\\nginalized Dalit community in the village were selected and \\ntrained to carry out the activities of sanitation workers. The two workers have taken on this role as a full-time job earn-ing a regular salary. Through their efforts, all the traditional village dumping spots were cleared and have since remained clear of open dumping. A landfill was created to replace the existing dump sites.  J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\nStep 6 Waste collection launch.\\nBeginning in July 2019, door-to-door collection was ini-\\ntiated using a manual cycle trolley. However, this mode of \\ntransport proved to be unsuccessful and laborious due to the many unpaved roads in the village. By September 2019, an electric three-wheeler was purchased, making waste col-lection much faster and easier. (See Fig.\\xa0 7) More houses \\ncould be covered each day and the team had more time for segregation and treatment of the waste. Each household has been trained on source segregation, and mixed waste is not accepted from the households. Student volunteers were engaged in conducting awareness sessions with households to promote source segregation.\\nStep 7 Waste management system\\nThe final step of implementation, during August to Sep-\\ntember 2019, was the establishment of an ongoing system \\nfor treatment, storage, and recycling of the collected waste. Wet waste is composted organically in aerobic NADEP (Narayan Deotao Pandharipande) method of composting, which uses a wide range of organic materials such as crop residues, weeds, forest litter and kitchen waste with an end-product of a fertilizer that serves as a good alternative to farmyard manure. Within 3\\xa0months of filling a pit, the pit can be emptied and the compost can be used in fields. Dry waste is segregated and stored under different categories—plastics, cardboard, glass, metal, cloth, etc.—for eventual recycling.\\nStep 8 Ongoing operation and monitoring.\\nDuring the final months of the project, the operation of \\nthe waste management system was closely monitored by \\nBarefoot College and a village-level supervisor. An ongoing process is being developed for supervision of the continued operation and maintenance of the system, including mainte-nance of the resource recovery site and overall performance tracking.\\nIn summary, this project was successful despite numerous \\nchallenges, including the following:\\n• Waste management and community hygiene are not a pri-ority for village residents; hence, it is difficult to support such systems solely through community contributions.\\n• Initially, the District Administration did not provide any support for this project. There was a month’s delay in obtaining the necessary documents for land allocation toward the project, which delayed the setup of infrastruc-ture.\\n• Existing waste in various dumping spots around the vil-lage was an ongoing hazard, since it could not be treated or recycled.\\n• Extreme weather conditions and the 2019 heat wave in Rajasthan resulted in fewer working hours per day; the team was able to work only during early morning and late evening hours.\\nNotwithstanding these challenges, the project demon-\\nstrated the feasibility of establishing a low-cost, community-driven waste management system in rural villages within the space of one year. The beneficial impacts of this work can be summarized as follows.\\n• Environmental protection All dumping areas in the vil-lage have been cleared, thus preventing animals from eat-ing plastic and other non-biodegradable waste littered on the streets. Clogged drains have been cleared of waste. Water bodies, soil, and ground water are no longer pol-\\nFig. 7  Villagers bring full \\ndustbins to the waste collection \\ntruck\\n Steps toward\\xa0a\\xa0resilient circular economy in\\xa0India  \\n1 3\\nluted by toxic non-biodegradable waste, making the vil-\\nlage hygienic and safe for living.\\n• Behavioral change The 3000 village residents, including men, women and children, have been sensitized regarding appropriate waste disposal and management. Almost all households practice source segregation and have ceased dumping and burning waste in the open.\\n• Livelihood generation Two persons from the village have been employed as cleanliness workers, earning a regu-lar income and considering themselves as members of a dignified occupational group with high social impact.\\n• Value recovery from waste In the space of 4\\xa0months, over 1000\\xa0kg of wet waste were converted to organic com-post that is being used to nourish farmers’ soil. Approxi-mately, 50\\xa0kg of dry waste have been segregated and diverted from landfills.\\n• Broader awareness Many neighboring villages have learned about this waste management model and are now demanding that it be set up in their communities as well. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Block Develop-ment Officer visited the waste management site and have expressed interest in funding replication of this project in other villages.\\nIt is important to ensure that these benefits are enduring \\nover time, and that villagers do not revert to their previous unhygienic practices. Monitoring of the waste management system is currently being performed by the Barefoot College team and the village committee representatives. The long-term aim is to fully transition the supervision of the system to the local governance authorities in order to ensure con-tinuity and sustainability. The Barefoot College team plans to reevaluate the impact of the program after 3\\xa0years, so that they can better understand and document the impacts of the waste management system on environmental and social parameters.\\nThe path forward\\nThe conference on Waste Management Innovation and the subsequent seed grants resulted in a number of use-ful insights and recommendations, which are summarized below.\\n• Based on circular economy principles, urban and agri-cultural wastes can be repurposed as industrial resources. There are a variety of proven methods and technologies available, ranging from centralized waste collection and processing to decentralized applications that could func-tion at a neighborhood or individual household scale.\\n• Circular economy advances will not only improve the resilience of urban and agricultural economies in the face of turbulent change, but also will deliver benefits including climate mitigation, food and water security, enhanced biodiversity, job creation, and empowerment of underprivileged communities.\\n• Innovations in design and communication are necessary to induce behavior change, ranging from recycling of trash to the use of toilets rather than open defecation. Customized strategies are needed due to the vast differ -\\nences between rural villagers and urban populations.\\nIn order to advance toward a circular economy, changes \\nin policy are needed to stimulate technological innova-tion and waste management improvements. The Swachh Bharat Mission represents a major step forward in raising consciousness and investing in cleaner practices. Indian industries and municipalities have shown that they can benefit from borrowing global best practices and proven approaches that provide benefits in terms of public health, sanitation, energy supply, water and land protection, and of course cost savings.\\nThere are a variety of instruments available to govern-\\nments in order to accelerate adoption of circular economy principles. These include regulatory requirements, market-based incentives such as subsidies, taxes, or cap and trade schemes, payments for enhancement of essential ecosystem services such as recarbonization of soil, and information campaigns to encourage voluntary initiatives.\\nA number of policy-based initiatives were recommended \\nby an expert panel that examined the potential for circular material and energy flows across key sectors of the Indian economy, including automotive, electronics, and construc-tion. (India Resource Panel, Ministry of Environment, For -\\nests and Climate Change 2016) The panel noted a need to improve the design and implementation of circular economy approaches, and offered a variety of policy recommenda-tions, including:\\n• Product eco-labeling schemes to disclose recycled con-tent and other environmental benefits\\n• Tax incentives to stimulate the use of greener and cleaner product and process technologies\\n• Design standards that include resource efficiency and use of secondary raw materials\\n• Standard business models and financial mechanisms for end-of-life product recovery\\n• Social innovations that support sharing, renting, leasing or pooling of products\\n• Special Economic Zones providing incentives for estab-lishment of recycling capabilities\\n• Preferential “green” procurement schemes based on cri-teria or approved product lists\\n• Raising consumer awareness through campaigns in print, broadcast, and social media  J.\\xa0Fiksel et al.\\n1 3\\n• Stakeholder consultations on policy implementation \\nexperiences and possible improvements\\nStimulation of voluntary compliance and innovation will \\nbe critical to the future success of waste management and circular economy programs. The systems approach sug -\\ngested in this paper can provide a holistic framework for understanding the challenges, opportunities, and benefits associated with various social, environmental, and indus-trial initiatives. Hopefully, this will lead to a coordinated portfolio of policies that will reduce waste proliferation and enable sustainable growth of the Indian economy.\\nIn summary, enlightened policies provide a foundation for \\nchange, but successful policy implementation will require stimulus for innovative demonstration programs at the local and regional level. The seed grants described here are exam-ples of initiatives that show the practical feasibility of circu-lar economy approaches and develop community commit-ment through active engagement of stakeholders.\\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank Neha Tiple and Debar -\\nshi Gupta of WISE, who co-authored several sections of this report. \\nWe are grateful to the US Consulate General, Mumbai, for funding the 2017 conference and the subsequent seed grants, especially the efforts of Tasneem Kalsekar and Tejaswini Karalkar.

In this article, we address this by examining the everyday practices\\nof food waste reduction in households as ethical work. We claim that the intertwined\\npractices, institutions and policies of the circular economy create moral categories andresponsibilities in everyday food consumption. Thus, the transition towards circular\\neconomy requires everyday ethical work carried out by consumers. However, our\\nanalysis also brings out some possible challenges related to this transition that hasnot yet been accomplished. Our research materials consist of 26 food waste diaries\\ncollected from Finnish households and participant observation in 4 leftover cooking\\nworkshops organized with the Finnish Martha organization.

Moreover, we utilize practice theoretical approach that has been widely used\\nin food waste and sustainable consumption studies and connect it with Foucault’stheory.

Due to\\nthe economic, environmental, and social signiﬁcance of food waste, reducing it is\\nalso part of the European Union’s Circular Economy Strategy (Prieto-Sandoval\\net al., 2018). The aim of this strategy is to increase resource efﬁciency by main-\\ntaining the value of materials, through closing the loop of the product life cycle\\n(EU Commission, 2014). Thus, the transition towards a circular economy (CE)\\nrequires changes in technological infrastructures, business models and consump-\\ntion practices (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017). However, research concerning the CE has\\nmainly focused on the engineering domain and the processes of manufacturing and\\nproduction (Korhonen et al., 2018). More research is needed for understanding the\\ntransition in the socio-material underpinnings of everyday life that the transition\\ntowards a CE requires (Mylan et al., 2016).\\nThis article argues that a CE is a moral economy (Gregson et al., 2015).\\nThis refers to an economic approach that aims to assess the moral justiﬁcations\\nof the economic organization and, moreover, the responsibilities and possibilities\\nof acting in its context (Sayer, 2015). In the context of the CE, moral categories\\nthat are created through the moral problematization of practices perceived as\\nunsustainable or morally wrong are part of the logic of economic organization\\n(Gregson et al., 2015). For example, such commonplace food consumption prac-\\ntice as reusing leftovers is a morally and ethically charged activity that constitutes\\nconsumer subjectivity. This article takes the practices of living with the abundance\\nof food as its starting point.1Thus, our perspective is based on the necessity of\\ndealing with excess production (Valkonen et al., 2019). As things stand, current\\nproduction volumes force people to ﬁnd environmentally and morally sustainable\\nways to live with food waste and other excess materials.\\nTo explore this subject, we adopt Foucault’s (1994) theory on ethical subjectiv-\\nity to examine the practices of reducing food waste. Foucault’s (2003) theory\\nenables not only the examination of individual consumer practices but also the\\nsuggestion of wider modes of ethical action in society as well. In addition to\\nFoucault’s conception of ethical subjectivity, our theoretical framework draws\\nfrom the practice-theoretical approach (Evans et al., 2017; Reckwitz, 2002;\\nShove, 2010). Practice theories have been previously used as an analytical frame-\\nwork in research concerning sustainable consumption in general (Gram-Hanssen,\\n2011; Plessz et al., 2014; Shove, 2003) and food waste in particular (Evans, 2011;\\nMattila et al., 2019; N €arv€anen et al., 2016; Southerton and Yates, 2015).2 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) We address the practices of food waste reduction as everyday ethical work on\\nthe self that aims to transform food consumption practices towards sustainability.Our research is guided by the question, how is ethical subjectivity constituted for\\nreducing food waste in the context of circular economy? Our research materials\\nconsist of participant observations from leftover cooking workshops organized\\nwith the Finnish Martha Organization and food waste diaries from Finnish house-holds. The study participants are mainly people interested in sustainability and thereduction of food waste and thus construct their ethical subjectivity in this context.\\nAlthough we adapt the Foucauldian approach to ethics, we also perceive that the\\nethical subjectivity in relation to food waste is constituted in situated and some-times ‘messy’ mundane events (Woolgar and Neyland, 2013). Based on this, weperceive the ethical relation as constantly produced and situated in everyday prac-tices, not simply internalized by our participants.\\nThe circular economy, food waste and practice theory\\nThe CE can be deﬁned as an alternative to the so-called linear economic model of\\n‘take, make, and dispose’ perceived as unsustainable (Ness, 2008). The transition\\nto a CE requires not only improved treatment of waste but also the curtailment ofdisposal (Ghisellini et al., 2016). Thus, the implementation of a CE calls for rad-ically alternative solutions in the whole economic model and resource management\\n(Ghisellini et al., 2016). Moreover, some researchers have also emphasized the\\nimportance of the connection between the generation of (food) waste and wastemanagement (Alexander et al., 2013) – in CE, the use of waste for proﬁtmay conﬂict with the aim to protect the environment by reducing waste\\n(Valkonen et al., 2017).\\nThe ﬁelds of industrial ecology and both ecological and environmental econom-\\nics have been the most signiﬁcant domains to date for research concerning CE\\n(Ghisellini et al., 2016; Korhonen et al., 2018). However, the research on CE has\\npaid less attention to consumers and consumption. This would be crucial for betterunderstanding the transformation to a CE, since the transition requires changes ineveryday consumption practices (Mylan et al., 2016). As Hobson (2016) has\\nargued, ‘[E]xtant academic, policy, and business-led analyses frame transforma-\\ntions towards the CE as predominantly issues of innovation, technical systems,ﬁscal and business incentives, and reformulated business models’ (p. 89). To ﬁll thisgap in research, we analyse the transition towards a CE from the viewpoint ofeveryday food waste practices in households.\\nOur research takes place in Finland, where food waste became a widely dis-\\ncussed problem after the Finnish Institute for Agriculture and Forestry (MTT)\\nbegan investigating it at the beginning of the 2010s (Raippalinna, 2019). Like in\\nother countries in the Global North, most of Finland’s food waste emerges inhouseholds – the amount of food wasted annually by households is 120–160 mil-lion kilograms (Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), n.d.). In addition,Lehtokunnas et al. 3 Finland’s public discourse is affected by EU objectives for consumer-level food\\nwaste reduction (Raippalinna, 2019).\\nWe adopt the practice-theoretical approach in our analysis (Hargreaves, 2011;\\nWarde, 2014). According to a much-cited deﬁnition by Reckwitz (2002), a social\\n‘practice’ (Praktik) is a routinized type of behaviour which consists of several ele-\\nments, interconnected to one other: forms of bodily activities, forms of mental activ-\\nities, ‘things’ and their use, a background knowledge in the form of understanding,\\nknow-how, states of emotion and motivational knowledge. (p. 249)\\nPractice theory is increasingly applied in the domain of sustainability research because\\nit allows consumption to be analysed as a social phenomenon (Corsini et al., 2019).Some of the previous practice-theoretical research concerning food waste and sustain-\\nable consumption has stressed that sustainability policies cannot be targeted only to\\nchange the actions of individual consumers while the material and social contexts of(over)consumption remain unchangeable (Evans, 2011; Evans et al., 2017; Shove,\\n2003). Thus, research on sustainable consumption should shift focus from individual\\nconsumers to the collective, routinized, and mundane aspects of consumption (Gram-Hanssen, 2011). Moreover, Sahakian and Wilhite (2014) state that in the context of\\nsustainable consumption, agency is distributed between people, objects and infra-\\nstructures that inﬂuence and are inﬂuenced by everyday life. Thus, unsustainablebehaviour cannot be changed simply through top-down management or behaviour\\nchange; rather, the surrounding circumstances must be addressed as well.\\nSocial scientiﬁc research concerning food waste and sustainable consumption has\\npaid little attention to the transition towards the CE, apart from the research of\\nMylan et al. (2016) on domestic food provisioning. However, practice-theoretical\\nfood waste research has shown, among other things, that the social, material andtemporal contexts of eating are important for understanding the production of food\\nwaste in households (Southerton and Yates, 2015), that preventing food waste\\nthrough cooking from leftovers requires varied culinary skills and knowledge(Cappellini, 2009; N €arv€anen et al., 2016), and that the production of food waste\\nis a consequence of keeping a family well-fed (Watson and Meah, 2012). It has also\\nacknowledged the signiﬁcance of nonhumans in the production and reduction offood waste (Mattila et al., 2019). Moreover, Alexander et al. (2013) have pointed out\\nthat the cause for household food waste can also sometimes be earlier in the food\\nchain – for example, household food waste might emerge from too big portion sizes.\\nFrom these viewpoints, the material and social contexts of everyday life and the\\nembodied knowledge are central to the production and reduction of food waste. In\\nline with the above, we approach food waste reduction as a social practice, empha-sizing the dynamics between ethical action and persistent socio-material practices\\nthat delimit transformation. We connect previous practice-theoretical work on\\nfood waste and sustainable consumption studies with Foucault’s (1994) theoryconcerning ethical subjectivity. According to Reckwitz (2002), Foucault’s late\\nwork on ethics can be perceived as ‘praxeological’. However, Foucault’s work4 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) has not been widely used in practice-theoretical research on food waste or sustain-\\nable consumption, apart from Hawkins’ (2006) research concerning the ethicalrelationship to waste. Thus, this article deepens the understanding of ethical sub-jectivity in practice-theoretical research on food waste.\\nMoral economies and the constitution of ethical subjectivity\\nin food waste reduction practices\\nWe approach the transition towards the CE in everyday practices through the\\nconcept of moral economy. Gregson et al. (2015) have pointed out, in theirresearch concerning the CE and resource recovery in the EU, that a CE is a\\nmoral economy, since there are right and wrong ways to circulate materials.\\nBy referring to the discussion concerning moral economy, we aim to highlightthat the practices, institutions and policies connected to the CE create moral cat-egories in the mundane practices of everyday life. These categories could be\\nexpressed, for example, through obligations such as recycling food waste.\\nThus, the concept of moral economy is useful in understanding the transition tothe CE at the level of everyday life.\\nOur analysis on the moralities of the CE is guided by Foucault’s (1994) con-\\nception of ethics as arts of existence. Foucault (1994) states that the self is not givento us and that to become ethical subjects, we have to constitute ourselves as ethical\\nbeings. For Foucault (1994), the constitution of the ethical self is not self-centred\\naction – it is about creating an ethos , a way relating to others. He divides the arts of\\nexistence into four techniques of the self: ethical substance, mode of subjectivation,self-forming activity and telos (Foucault, 1994: 263–266). Ethical substance refers\\nto the part of the self that is worked over by ethics, in other words, the matter of\\nthe ethical work (Foucault, 1994: 263–264). The mode of subjectivation means ‘theway in which people are invited or incited to recognize their moral obligations’(Foucault, 1994: 264). Self-forming activity refers to the measures we take to mod-\\nerate ourselves as ethical subjects. The fourth dimension, telos, means the objective\\nof our moral behaviour (Foucault, 1994: 263–266).\\nFoucault’s conceptualization of ethical subjectivity adds to the understanding of\\nthe ethical practices of food consumption and the CE as a moral economy byshowing the concrete work consumers do to evaluate, sustain and transformtheir practices. Through this, it enables us to address the possibilities for consumer\\nagency in the context of the transformation to a CE. Referring to Foucault (2003),\\nthe ways in which people form ethical subjectivity are not invented by the individ-uals themselves. Rather, they are based on the models suggested by society, socialgroup, or culture (Foucault, 2003). Thus, using Foucault’s conception enables us\\nto take a look not only at the ways our participants act as individuals but also at\\nthe modes of ethical action suggested more widely in the surrounding society orculture. It also allows us to examine the limitations that practices bring to theenactment of ethical behaviour and how these difﬁculties in following moralLehtokunnas et al. 5 principles are justiﬁed, explained and rationalized by our participants. Referring to\\nShove (2010), our analysis of the transformation of the practices does not perceiveour participants as ‘autonomous agents of change’ (p. 1279). Rather, we perceive\\nthat daily domestic conventions ‘are sustained and changed through the ongoing\\nreproduction of social practice’ (Shove, 2010: 1279).\\nResearch materials and methods\\nOur research material consists of participant observation in 4 leftover cookingworkshops organized with the Finnish Martha organization\\n2in spring 2018 and\\n26 food waste diaries collected from Finnish households during spring 2019.\\nThe participant observation material was collected as a part of a research projectconcerning the reduction of food waste on the consumer level, and the food waste\\ndiaries are part of the ﬁrst author’s PhD dissertation project. The workshops were\\ndocumented using the EthOS mobile application,\\n3designed for ethnographic\\nresearch. Our research can thus be seen as ethnographically informed. However,\\nit differs from traditional ethnographic research, since it did not include long-termﬁeld work in a ‘natural’ ﬁeld (Emerson et al., 1995).\\nIn any case, this kind of data enables us to observe the ethical considerations of\\nthe participants, since the cooking workshop focused on the reduction of food\\nwaste by cooking creatively from leftovers. Furthermore, while it is difﬁcult to\\ngain access to the participants’ everyday lives through traditional participantobservation at home, this method offers us a resource-efﬁcient way of accessing\\nthe phenomenon at hand (Sirola et al., 2019). Four workshops were designed\\nin cooperation with the Martha organization’s specialist, and they lasted from3–4 hours, with a maximum of 10 participants in each.\\nIn addition to the participant observation material, we analyse the food waste\\ndiaries to achieve a closer view of people’s everyday practices related to food in\\ntheir homes – the diaries enable us to observe the participants’ mundane, routin-\\nized practices. Diaries enable regularity, personality and contemporaneity in datacollection (Alaszewski, 2006). Thus, the diaries enable us to analyse concrete every-\\nday practices, rather than only observing the workshops and relying on partici-\\npants’ descriptions of their practices. Through these two data sets, we illustratehow consumers perform their everyday food-related practices and how they aim to\\nmodify and transform them. The diaries were kept by a casual sampling of people\\nrecruited mainly from different Finnish Facebook groups (Puskaradio Sein €ajoki,\\nRuokah €avikkiryhm €a, Tampere-ryhm €a, Vegaani-ryhm €a) and by sharing the\\nresearch call on the ﬁrst author’s Facebook wall. The diaries were kept for aperiod of 2–4 weeks by the participants.\\nThe participants of our study are mainly women, and most live in the biggest\\ncities of Finland. It is crucial to note that most of the participants are notably\\nconcerned about food waste and the environmental issues related to it.\\nThis emphasis in our data results from the simple fact that it is hard to getpeople with no interest in the subject to take part in the research. Participant6 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) backgrounds obviously affect the ways in which they verbalize their practices, and\\nthis unavoidably has an effect on the results of our research – but it would be hard\\nto answer our research question with data from people with little or no interest inthe subject.\\nThe quotes presented in the following section of this article have been translated\\nfrom Finnish to English by the authors, with the aim of retaining as much idio-\\nmatic meaning as possible. The diary material and the participant observationmaterial were both encoded using the Atlas.ti software. The ﬁrst author of this\\narticle did the preliminary coding, and the other authors commented on the emer-\\ngent ﬁndings. The codes were arranged according to Foucault’s (1994) four dimen-sions of ethical subjectivity.\\nAnalysis\\nIn this section, we analyse the four dimensions of ethical work carried out byconsumers in the practices of reducing food waste. Our focus is on how everyday\\npractices enable and restrict possibilities for making food consumption practices\\nmore sustainable through ethical work on the self.\\nEthical substance\\nThe ethical substance refers to the part of the self that is perceived to need moral\\nprocessing (Foucault, 1994). The ethical substance in the context of food consump-\\ntion is articulated very clearly throughout the data: Current food consumptionpractices are perceived as wasteful and unethical, and food consumption thus hasto be modiﬁed. In the data, the disposal of food is rather often described as a sin or\\nwaste. Wasting food raises feelings of annoyance, disturbance and anger. Frugality\\nwith food is seen as a moral duty. This is connected with the environmentalconcerns related to food waste, but it also reﬂects a more direct moral obligation\\nto respect food. In the following quote, a participant describes how she perceives\\nthe disposal of food as a sin:\\n[...] Though I have a passionate attitude towards the subject, since I think that dis-\\nposing of food is a kind of sin. Climate change forces people to observe their ownwastefulness. (Diary entry, a 43-year-old woman living with her 2-year-old child)\\nThe participant recognizes that food consumption is a signiﬁcant factor affecting\\nclimate change. She sees the wastefulness of people as the main reason for the stateof the planet; that is, the participant considers that people have to modify their\\nwasteful food consumption practices for environmental reasons. The participant’s\\nstatement has a strong moral charge – she connects Christian ethics (wasting foodis a sin) to the moral obligation to act in a way that minimizes the effects of theconsumption on the climate. Thus, the reason for avoiding food waste is not the\\nbiblical virtue of frugality but instead the current ecological crisis that forcesLehtokunnas et al. 7 people to observe their consumption behaviour. However, it is not enough to be\\naware of the problem; concrete and material actions must be taken to modify\\nconsumption (Koskinen et al., 2018; see also Evans, 2011; Southerton andYates, 2015). Unfortunately, awareness does not often easily translate into\\naction, as the following quotations on coffee consumption illustrate,\\nIn the morning, I realize, I always make 2.5 cups of coffee. I drink only one cup.\\nThis feels stupid, I have not ﬁxed it, I’ve been too lazy to do that. I count this as waste.\\nI decide to try to be better. (Diary entry 20.2.2019, a 22-year-old woman living alone)\\nI still haven’t learned to make less coffee. (Diary entry 23.2.2019, same person)\\nCoffee still ends up in the trash!! (Diary entry 4.3.2019, same person)\\nThe diary acts as a disrupting element that forces the participant to notice her\\nwasteful routinized behaviour. However, as the quote suggests, turning this obser-\\nvation into action and actually making less coffee is not straightforward. Referring\\nto Evans (2011), domestic conventions are intertwined with the social and materialorganization of everyday life. It is easy to make too much coffee because coffee is\\nreadily available and using a coffee maker is effortless. In this quote, the art of\\nexistence is formed through attempts to modify the resilient everyday reality.\\nThe rational objective to protect the environment is not the only reason raised\\nfor the avoidance of food waste. Previous research on food waste has shown that\\nexisting cultural logics make people feel guilty about throwing food away (Watsonand Meah, 2012). A large variety of emotions is often present in food-waste–relat-\\ned practices, such as excitement when preventing food waste by cooking from\\nleftovers or guilt when disposing of spoiled food. In the following ﬁeld note, aparticipant in a leftover cooking workshop describes her feelings towards the dis-\\nposal of food:\\nA participant tells me that soup is a dish that they usually cook from leftovers. In the\\nwinter, she does not buy tomatoes since they do not taste good and it is terrifying if\\nthey end up as waste. (A ﬁeld note from a food waste cooking workshop)\\nThe participant describes it as ‘terrifying’ to see food wasted. This participant does\\nnot articulate clearly why the disposal of food is so upsetting or terrifying, insteadassuming that her feelings are in some way commonly shared and understood.\\nAs Reckwitz (2002) has pointed out, ‘every practice contains a certain practice-\\nspeciﬁc emotionality’ (p. 254). Thus, according to him, emotions are not only theinternal feelings of individuals; they also belong to practices as a form of knowl-\\nedge (Reckwitz, 2002). Negative feelings are part of the practice of disposing of\\nfood. Thus, in addition to the rational objective to protect the environment fromthe effects of overconsumption, emotions are central to the modiﬁcation of food\\nconsumption practices.8 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) Mode of subjectivation\\nIn Foucault’s (1994) conception of ethics, the mode of subjectivation invites us to\\nrecognize moral commitments, and it further refers to the ways in which individuals\\nconstitute their relation to a moral rule and recognize themselves as obligated to put\\nit into practice (p. xxx). As our analysis concerning the ethical substance has illus-\\ntrated, the matter of ethical work is unsustainable food consumption practices and\\nthe emotions connected with them. Thus, the moral rule of food waste practices\\ncould be ‘do not waste food’. Based on this, the central moral commitment in our\\ndata is to avoid wasting food and thus make consumption volumes more reasonable.\\nThis has to be done in order to maintain the world that we live in – in other words,\\ntake care of the planet so that both we ourselves and future generations can live on it.\\nThe relation to this moral obligation to avoid food waste is formed through the\\nmodiﬁcation and observation of one’s own and other people’s behaviour. In the\\nfood waste diaries, this became particularly apparent when our participants told us\\nabout observing the actions of their family members and educating them. Many of\\nthe participants described irritation or frustration with how their family members,\\nfriends or acquaintances treated food. Thus, acting as an educator or observer is\\npart of forming the relationship to the moral obligation to avoid wasting food.A participant describes her frustration with her children as follows:\\n[...] The way our children treat food sometimes makes me angry. They do not scrape\\nkettles etc. properly and always leave a little food in the bottom of the kettle. They\\nmight also take too much food [ ...] I persistently try to eat their leftovers, even\\nthough I am 100% vegetarian and occasionally on a vegan diet. I also try to\\nremind my children that they should not dispose of food. (Diary entry, a 40-year-\\nold woman living with her husband, three children and three cats)\\nIt is important for the participant to train her children to consume food wisely and\\nmake a note of it if they do not act in the right way. Unfortunately, her children do\\nnot always act in the way she wishes, and she thus eats their leftovers, even though\\nthey do not ﬁt in her diet. Through these actions, she creates her ethical relation to\\nfood. Referring to Cappellini and Parsons (2013), revaluing and consuming leftovers\\nis a practice towards food that signals family membership. Thus, while striving for\\nthe ethical aim to avoid food waste, the participant also manifests her role as a\\nmember of the family by enacting the practice of eating her children’s leftovers. In\\ndoing so, she is giving up on her other preferences in order to fulﬁl a greater aim.\\nIn addition to the environmental concerns, the prevention of food waste is impor-\\ntant for our participants because they often feel a sense of moral duty towards\\npeople who do not have enough food. According to FAO of the United Nations\\n(n.d.), 820 million people are going hungry. Our participants often state that it is\\nimmoral to waste food while a large group of the world’s population suffers from\\nhunger. For example, one participant in the leftover cooking workshop told that she\\nconsiders her wasteful food waste practices ‘wrong’ since ‘half of the world’ suffersLehtokunnas et al. 9 from hunger. Based on this, a sense of moral duty towards people who suffer from\\nfood scarcity is often central to relating to the moral rule of not wasting food.\\nHowever, care of the self and family is also deeply connected with eating prac-\\ntices, and this might cause contradictions between the avoidance of food waste and\\ntaking care of one’s health. It is important that the family’s food is not spoiled, for\\nexample, and that no one overeats. One participant in a leftover cooking workshopconsiders the importance of safety:\\n[...] A participant is concerned about the safety of the food offered for the children.\\nShe would not offer the children ﬁsh after the expiration date has passed – she also\\nsays that she is very careful with what she eats, so if the food is ﬁne for her, it is ﬁne\\nfor the children. She also says that she sometimes calls her sister, who is a cook, andasks her opinion on whether some food item is still edible or not. (A ﬁeld note from\\nleftover cooking workshop)\\nIn this quote, the participant points out three methods for assessing the safety of\\nthe food: expiration dates, her own assessments and her sister’s expert knowledge\\nas a cook. Assessment of edibility based on expiration dates links food to institu-tional governance – an authority has provided guidelines regarding the safety of\\nthe food, and, since eating spoiled ﬁsh is a great risk, the participant relies on this\\nfor certainty. Moreover, the participant’s own assessment is based on her embod-ied knowledge regarding the safety of the food – ‘If it is ﬁne for me, it is ﬁne for the\\nchildren’. Finally, if the labelled date or the participant’s own knowledge is not\\nsufﬁciently reliable, she trusts her sister’s expertise as a professional cook to assessthe safety. These different techniques of assessment show the ethical complexity of\\nacting with surplus food in everyday life – you cannot dispose food if you are not\\ncompletely sure that it is not edible, but however, there is no room for mistakesregarding food safety when you cook for your family.\\nThus, the way the relation to the moral obligation to avoid wasting food is\\nformed has much to do with the unpredictable and complex nature of everydaylife. In addition to the avoidance of food waste, there are several other demands\\nthat shape everyday requirements related to food, such as caring for children.\\nAs Meah and Jackson (2017) have pointed out in their research concerning careand convenience, care can be manifested in many ways, and these manners of\\nexpressing care do not all cohere with normative beliefs regarding the ‘right’\\nways to, for example, take care of one’s health or environment. Thus, the relationto the obligation not to waste food has to be formed in a ﬂexible manner. The need\\nfor this ﬂexibility might emerge, for example, from the production of food waste\\nresulting from the unpredictability of how much the children will actually eat.In our data, this has usually been accepted as an unavoidable part of everyday\\nlife. A participant describes a frequent situation in her 2-week diary:\\nI threw away rice that was left on my child’s plate, and when we were having supper,\\nI threw away a half slice of bread that my child did not eat. I did not feel anything10 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) while doing this, since the food waste was not avoidable. (Diary entry, a 43-year-old\\nwoman living with her 2-year-old child)\\nChild care sometimes leads to food waste, and the participant’s acceptance of this\\nis manifested through her statement that she did not feel anything while discarding\\nher child’s leftovers. This was because the food waste was not avoidable.Obviously, being a good parent does not involve pressing your children to eattoo much.\\nThe willingness to take care of oneself by following a healthy diet can lead to\\nfood waste as well. For example, one participant describes in her diary how in theirhousehold, most of the food waste results from the jars of food stored in therefrigerator, such as pastes, mayonnaise and jam. She explains that these foodsusually spoil, since she and her spouse do not eat them regularly, and thus getdiscarded. In these situations, the commitment to healthy and diverse eating over-takes the moral obligation not to waste. As Evans (2014) has brought out, con-vention dictates that people should eat properly, and eating mayonnaise and jam\\nevery day or pressing children to eat too much does not ﬁt into ‘a proper diet’.\\nAll in all, even though there is a moral commitment to prevent food waste, theseunpredictable and ethically ‘messy’ situations illustrated by our participants showhow the relation to the moral rule against wasting food is not formed straightfor-wardly. Instead, it is affected by multiple and sometimes contradictory ethicalsensitivities, moral obligations, practices and conventions.\\nSelf-forming activity\\nSelf-forming activity means the techniques we use to become ethical subjects(Foucault, 1994). Our participants pointed out several techniques for modifyingtheir behaviour. These are often different techniques to disrupt the wasteful habitsrooted in everyday life, such as notes hung on the refrigerator, remedies learnedfrom the Internet, friends, or family, and an overall sense of respect towards thefood. In the leftover cooking workshops, participants described that the attitude\\ntowards food is very important – you should respect food and not be too picky.\\nHowever, eating leftover food does not have to be unpleasant at all. Cooking skillsand creativity are the key practical techniques to make leftover food desirable andaesthetic. A participant describes how she cooked from leftovers:\\nThere were some salad, sliced raw red cabbage, and a couple pieces of roasted carrot\\nleft from yesterday’s meal. At lunchtime, I added some tomatoes, sweet pepper, and\\nleafy greens to the meal. I fried the red cabbage and carrots in a pan with seitan\\nkebab. In addition, I cooked some broccoli from the fridge. (Diary entry, a 34-year-old woman living with her spouse)\\nThe participant knows in detail the ingredients that were left from yesterday and\\nwhat is needed to cook a new meal using them. Her actions show her knowledge,Lehtokunnas et al. 11 skills and creativity in cooking. In the data, participants often write that leftover\\nfood actually makes cooking easier, since you can just add some new ingredients to\\nan almost-ready meal. In one of the leftover cooking workshops, the participantsalso stressed the importance of aesthetics in cooking and serving the leftover food.\\nThey claimed that beautiful-looking food even tastes better. This is part of\\nthe constitution of the ethical self: Food waste is avoided, but in a mannerthat is pleasant.\\nHowever, leftover food is not always beautiful or aesthetic. Leftovers are some-\\ntimes eaten out of a sense of responsibility, not for pleasure. For example, eatingchildren’s leftovers was rather usual for our participants. A participant describes\\nhow he tries to avoid food waste when cooking for his two children:\\nI try to cook my children the kind of food they like, and if they do not eat all the food\\nfrom their plates or they have taken it too much, I usually tell them to leave their\\nplates on the table, and I then eat their leftovers. (Diary entry, a 51-year-old manliving with his two children)\\nThe avoidance of food waste requires knowledge of family members’ preferences.\\nPrevious studies on food consumption show that feeding children is demanding\\nwork – the food provided cannot be just any food; it has to satisfy the family\\n(DeVault, 1991: 40). Furthermore, eating children’s leftovers is a practice thatshapes the family’s relations – you would not eat leftovers from a stranger’s\\nplate, and it is usually one of the parents who eats the leftovers. Eating leftovers\\nis thus an expression of affection (Cappellini and Parsons, 2013). Based on this, inthis quote, eating the children’s leftovers constructs the ethical self in relation to\\nfood and family. This quote does not tell whether this is pleasant for the father or\\nnot, but in some parts of our data, food is eaten rather than discarded even if it isunpleasant. In these situations, disciplined elements deﬁne the ethical actions in\\nrelation to food. A participant describes eating spoiled food:\\nI ate the food that was left at room temperature overnight, and now my stomach\\nhurts ...It was worth it anyway, since I left the food there myself. (Diary entry, a\\n26-year-old woman living with her husband and dog)\\nIn the quote above, the participant seems to consider that she is responsible for\\nletting the food spoil and thus it is morally right to suffer from the illness that iscaused by it. Thus, the mistake of forgetting the food on the table is compensated\\nby taking the risk of falling ill. The sensitivity and intimacy of eating are revealed\\nin a very harsh manner when the food we eat makes us fall ill. However, it is notthat usual in our data that the participants would eat spoiled food. Because of the\\nrisks and disgust, we have a need to separate from spoiled food to maintain our\\nself, our own being. Thus, it is also important to note that discarding the food thatis not edible is an ethical act that constitutes the self (Hawkins, 2006). Based on\\nthis, disposing of spoiled food is an inseparable part of domestic practices (Evans,12 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) 2011) and cannot be deﬁned only as ‘unethical’ or careless behaviour. Even though\\nwasting food is morally problematic, separating from the spoiled food can be a\\nrevealing experience:\\nWe cleaned our fridge and disposed of a bit of spoiled yoghurt, the remainder of the\\niced tea, a couple of mouldy sweet potato balls, a bit of tofu, and a last piece of pastry\\nforgotten in the fridge. Cleaning the fridge felt good, even though it is a pity to throwfood away. (Diary entry, a 26-year old woman living with her spouse and dog)\\nIn the above quote, separating from spoiled food cleanses the personal environ-\\nment and the self. This kind of need to separate from the spoiled and dirty food is atechnique of the ethical self that might sometimes be contradictory with the morallogic of the CE. The disposal of food is unpleasant and problematic, but it is some-times necessary. Thus, the practices related to our conceptions of cleanliness might\\nsometimes contradict with the ethical aim to prevent food waste (Hawkins, 2006).\\nMoreover, conventions related to cleanliness, such as keeping the refrigerator free ofspoiled products, are a normalized part of everyday practices (Shove, 2003). Thus,disposal is also signiﬁcant for the practices of forming the ethical self (Hawkins,\\n2006). Most of our participants have the option to recycle their food waste with their\\ncondominium’s biowaste recycling bin. However, some of the participants have theirown compost bins. A participant tells about her recycling habits:\\nMy relationship to shrivelled carrots and dried bread might be of interest to you:\\nI think that they are material for my bokashi compost bin. They will transform intoself-made, nutritious soil for my vegetable garden. They are not worthless waste. I usethe bokashi around the year, and I use my condominium’s biowaste bin only forthe waste that emerges from my dog’s meat-based foods, such as chicken legs.\\nThus, the carbon emissions are really low, since using bokashi is a closed-circle activ-\\nity. (Diary entry, a 67-year-old woman living with her three dogs)\\nThe quote above shows how different recycling practices transform the relation to\\nfood and moreover the ontology of the food itself: The food that cannot be used\\nas human nourishment turns into nourishment for plants that are to be eaten.This constitutes a closed circle for food waste. Here, food waste is not shut outof the personal environment to the system of waste management; instead, its\\ntransformation becomes part of the daily routine. Thus, some new technologies\\nand material arrangements of living with food waste have potential for transform-ing food waste practices towards the acceptance of waste, rather than its avoidance(Hawkins, 2006).\\nTelos\\nTelos refers to the ultimate goal of the moral behaviour (Foucault, 1994). In our\\ndata, climate change is sometimes explicitly given as a major inﬂuence on theLehtokunnas et al. 13 willingness to transform wasteful food consumption practices. However, the rea-\\nsons for the willingness to avoid food waste are not usually stated clearly or\\nexplicitly in our data – instead, participants often merely say, for example, that\\navoiding food waste is important for them, that they have learned at home that\\nfood does not belong in the bin, that they avoid food waste for ethical reasons, or\\nthat they have an ‘inner will’ to avoid food waste. The following quote illustratesthis in more detail:\\nWhen asked about the reasons for participating in the leftover cooking workshop, the\\nparticipant responds that she felt a sense of responsibility towards the subject. (A ﬁeld\\nnote from a leftover cooking workshop)\\nIt seems that the appreciation of food by not throwing it away is a moral aim that\\nconnects the food to several different factors, such as environmental concerns, care\\nfor distant others, and overall emotional commitments related to food. Thus, wedeﬁne the telos of the moral behaviour as ‘becoming a responsible citizen by\\navoiding or recycling food waste’ in the context of the CE. In more detail, such\\na ‘responsible citizen’ aims to create a balanced relationship to the self, other\\npeople, and the environment. Through this, the aim is to create a thrifty ethos\\nby doing everything that is possible to avoid the disadvantages of food waste.\\nThe following quote illustrates this:\\nAvoiding food waste has always been important for me. If I go to a restaurant and do\\nnot eat all of the food, I always take the leftovers with me. I buy only as much food as\\nI eat. 10 years back, I was a regular dumpster diver, due to my small income andenvironmental reasons. It felt at the same time good and bad to ﬁnd raw fruit and\\ncakes in neighbours’ bins. (Diary entry, a 32-year-old woman living with her rabbit)\\nThe prevention of food waste is not limited only to the above participant’s own\\ndomestic practices. Utilizing other people’s waste through dumpster diving reveals\\nobjects that have been shut out, such as raw fruit and cakes. The participant writes\\nhow it felt simultaneously good and bad to ﬁnd completely edible food from the\\nbin: It is nice to ﬁnd something useful, but at the same time it reveals the magni-\\ntude of wastefulness. Dumpster diving is a radical practice that constitutes the\\nrelationship to food and waste in a completely different way from the usual prac-tices of use and disposal. The participant presents herself as a responsible consum-\\ner who does everything possible to avoid food waste. She thus points out the\\npractices through which she aims to constitute herself as a responsible citizen in\\nthe context of the CE.\\nConcluding discussion\\nBased on Foucault’s ethical theory, our analysis has explored through four differ-\\nent dimensions how the work on ethical subjectivity enables the transformation of14 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0) food consumption practices into more sustainable and circular ones. Foucault’s\\ntheory on ethical subjectivity, in combination with practice-theoretical research,\\nprovides a useful analytical framework for consumer researchers to address vari-ous aspects of ethical consumption, including energy consumption or air travel.\\nFurthermore, the CE literature currently lacks in-depth understanding about con-\\nsumer culture, which provides consumer researchers an opportunity for cross-fertilization, following the path set by this study.\\nOur analysis reveals that the ethical substance in our data is the unsustainable\\nfood consumption practices and the emotions related to them. Both are modiﬁedthrough ethical work. However, habits are sometimes rooted deeply in everyday\\nroutines and thus are not always changed easily. Our analysis suggests that the\\ntransition to a CE cannot be carried out only by teaching consumers the ‘right’way to do things and providing infrastructures to implement the CE – rather,\\nchanging consumption practices is a process of constant transformation and\\nmodiﬁcation.\\nMoreover, the mode of subjectivation to the moral rule not to waste food is\\nformed through observing and acting as an educator to the family and others. Our\\nparticipants felt a moral conviction to avoid food waste for environmental reasonsand because many people live with a shortage of food. However, as our analysis\\nsuggests, concerns about the safety and healthiness of the food, as well as the\\nunpredictability of everyday life with children, result in competing moral princi-ples. Thus, the relation to the moral obligation to avoid food waste has to be\\nformed in a ﬂexible manner.\\nThe self-forming activity in our data is based on creativity, skills, learning new\\nthings, anticipation and a right attitude towards food. The creative practices of\\nliving with excess food bring joy to everyday life, but however, avoiding food waste\\nalso sometimes involves strict self-discipline. All in all, the self-forming activityaims to transform the food consumption process through different techniques of\\ndisrupting wasteful consumption practices. However, separating from food waste\\nis also crucial for forming the ethical self. Finally, based on our analysis, the telos\\nof the ethical action is to become a responsible citizen in the CE. Through the\\nethos of thrift, the aim is to create a balanced relationship to the self, others and\\nthe nature.\\nIn contrast to those sampled in our data, it is crucial to note that there are\\nplenty of people who are not interested in transforming their practices into more\\nsustainable ones. This is problematic, since the transition to a CE requires, thatconsumers take the CE as their moral project. It would also be important to\\nresearch the practices of people who are not that concerned about the sustainabil-\\nity issues of food consumption.\\nIt is crucial to note that if we want to take seriously the moral complexity of\\neveryday life, we cannot assume the CE as a moral economy of simple ‘rights’ and\\n‘wrongs’. Thus, we must consider that if we want to have a clear view of the CE, wecannot perceive the role of citizens only through the acceptance or rejection of\\npractices that have been designed on their behalf (Hobson, 2016). This is in lineLehtokunnas et al. 15 with Mylan et al.’s (2016) notion that ‘consumption in the home is far more com-\\nplex than securing the “right” ﬂow of goods and disposing of the waste in the\\n“right” way’ (p. 10). Thus, the discourse on the CE should not slip into moralizing\\nand blaming overspending consumers (Evans, 2011). Instead of such sanctimony,\\nit is important to pay attention to the need for changes in political decision-making\\nand our whole way of life.\\nFinally, we want to present some possible policy implications related to food\\nwaste reduction and the implementation of the CE. Political programmes, such as\\nthe EU’s CE Strategy mentioned in the ‘Introduction’ section, appear quite distant\\nfrom the perspective of everyday life. Thus, more local initiatives to promote the\\nCE are needed. The leftover cooking workshop organized with the Finnish Martha\\nOrganization and food waste diaries that were used as research material in this\\narticle provide examples of this kind of local means of inﬂuence. Finally, although\\nwe do not claim that current volumes of disposal are reasonable, our results are in\\nline with sociological research’s ﬁndings that disposal and waste are necessary for\\nthe enactment of domestic practice (Evans, 2011). This is an inescapable impedi-\\nment to the CE’s ideal of ending the production of waste.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors want to thank the Finnish Martha Organization for their participation to the\\nresearch and all the volunteers that participated by writing the food waste diaries.

To curb this trend and reduce adverse\\nenvironmental impacts, food waste reduction has been sat on the political agenda, together with ambitious\\nmaterial recycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets.\\nThis study analyses the environmental bene ﬁts of two waste management systems for household organic food\\nwaste, namely recycling by anaerobic digestion (AD) and incineration. Recycling rates, energy eﬃciency andGHG emissions are reviewed to determine the environmental pro ﬁle of the downstream systems. The avoided\\nGHG emissions achieved by the respective waste management strategies are further compared with the ones\\nachieved by food waste prevention strategies. The study combines a material ﬂow analysis (MFA) assessing the\\ndownstream system with published life cycle analysis (LCA) results for the upstream system. The method wasdemonstrated as a proof-of-concept case study for the city of Trondheim, Norway.\\nIt was found that the recycling of food waste with AD performs better in terms of recycling rates and GHG\\nemissions than incineration, provided that diesel is substituted by biogas. However, the energy eﬃciency of the\\nincineration process was found to be slightly higher than of the AD option. Nonetheless, relatively small re-\\nductions in food wastage (15% and 30%) resulted in large amounts of avoided emissions, outweighing thebeneﬁts of recycling strategies. For mitigating climate change, the prevention of food waste clearly stood out as\\nthe most eﬀ ective strategy. Norwegian authorities should focus equally much on household food waste pre-\\nvention than on optimising food waste management systems.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe European Union's approach to waste management is currently\\nbased on two main pillars. On the one hand, the Waste Framework\\nDirective (2008/98/EC, Article 4) favours waste prevention over reuse,\\nfollowed by recycling, energy recovery and ﬁnally disposal\\n(European Commission, 2008 ).\\nOn the other hand, the Circular Economy package adopted by\\nEuropean Commission in 2015 advocates an economic system thatleaves no waste to be land ﬁlled and that keeps all material ﬂows in the\\neconomy through reuse, redesign, material recovery or energy recovery(European European Commission, 2015). Two main elements are in-\\ntroduced: the land ﬁll ban on speci ﬁc waste fractions such as organic\\nwaste, and speci ﬁc collection and recycling targets for the various waste\\nfractions.\\nSeveral European cities have in the context of a circular economy\\nrecently implemented source sorting of household organic waste, as thisfraction contains high energy and nutrient levels and has a high po-tential for recovery. Environmental and economic bene ﬁts have hence\\nled European authorities to focus on organic waste recycling and tolargely invest in biogas facilities, resulting in Europe now being the\\nworld's leading producer of biogas (Hamilton et al., 2015; Scarlat et al.\\n2018). Anaerobic digestion (AD) converts waste into biogas and di-\\ngestate, which can be used to produce electricity, heat, fuel and soil\\namendment products ( Bernstad and la Cour Jansen, 2011 ,2012;\\nBernstad Saraiva Schott and Andersson, 2015; Khalid, Arshad, Anjum,\\nMahmood, and Dawson, 2011; Modahl et al., 2016; Scarlat, 2018).\\nPrevious studies have concluded that AD as waste management optionresults in net environmental bene ﬁts when compared to incineration,\\ncomposting and land ﬁlling ( Bernstad and Andersson, 2015;\\nEdwards, Othman, Crossin, and Burn, 2017 ;Evangelisti, Lettieri,\\nBorello, and Clift, 2014 ;Khoo, Lim, and Tan, 2010; Raadal, Stensgård,\\nLyng, and Hanssen, 2016).

All rights reserved.\\nT based energy systems, especially when biogas substitutes fuel in\\ntransportation (Niu et al., 2013; Lozanovski et al., 2014; Lyng et al.,\\n2015). The environmental bene ﬁts, however, depend on technology\\nchoices, the substituted products, the impact categories analysed andthe area under study ( Bernstad and la Cour Jansen, 2011 ,2012;\\nModahl et al., 2016 ).\\nEven though waste prevention is a top priority in the European\\nwaste policy, reducing food waste has only lately been recognized as apriority area both at an international, European and Norwegian level.\\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 12.3 sat the topic on the\\nagenda in 2015 by aiming at “halving per capita global food waste at\\nthe retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along the pro-duction and supply chains, including post-harvest losses ”. In Europe,\\nfood waste reduction has become one of the priority areas in theCircular Economy package adopted in 2015. In Norway, an agreement\\nbetween the government and the food industry was concluded in June\\n2017, aiming at reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 (Klima og\\nmiljødepartementet, 2017).\\nThese resolutions are of importance as food waste is in fact a huge\\nchallenge. Approximately one third of the food produced worldwide is\\nwasted throughout the supply chain, representing loss of resources\\nconsumed, such as water, land, energy and labour ( FAO, 2013 ). 12% of\\nthe total Norwegian household food consumption is wasted(Stensgård and Hanssen, 2015 ), of which two thirds are avoidable food\\nproducts ( Bernstad and Andersson, 2015 ;Bjørnerud and\\nSyversen, 2017 ;Syversen, Hanssen, and Bratland, 2018 ).\\nVanham, Bouraoui, Leip, Grizzetti, and Bidoglio (2015) estimated that\\nas much as 80% the European food waste can be classi ﬁed as avoidable.\\nFood waste hence indirectly causes large environmental damages, inaddition to the direct impacts of waste treatment at disposal, and\\ntherefore give rise to ethical, social and economic concerns. The pre-\\nvention of food waste can remedy to several of these aspects ( Eberle and\\nFels, 2016; Salhofer, Obersteiner, Schneider, and Lebersorger, 2008 ;\\nUNEP, 2016), however, prevention measures have until now receivedfar less attention than waste treatment and recovery measures.\\nFew previous studies have compared the environmental bene ﬁts of\\nfood waste prevention with the ones of various waste handling solu-\\ntions for several indicators. This comparison has been partly covered by\\nBernstad and Andersson (2015) , who concluded based on LCA metho-\\ndology that food waste minimization strategies result in far greaterbeneﬁts for global warming compared to both incineration and AD.\\nThis supports the conclusions presented by Matsuda, Yano, Hirai, and\\nSakai (2012) . Further, Hamilton et al. (2015) concluded using MFA\\nmethodology that food waste minimization strategies result in greaterenergy saving potential compared to food waste recycling strategies.\\nThere is little literature on this topic, and since the Circular Economy\\npackage seems to focus mostly on recovery and recycling strategies,\\nwhile the waste hierarchy and overall policy should give highest\\npriority to prevention, this limited knowledge is seen as a problem.\\nThis study aims at analysing the performance of these two re-\\nspective strategies (transition to a circular economy and waste pre-\\nvention) for the case of food waste based on three relevant indicators in\\nthe light of CE: recycling rates, energy e ﬃciency and generated/\\navoided GHG emissions. For capturing these three indicators which areclosely interlinked, we use a multi-layer MFA framework to model the\\nwaste management system. The upstream (production system) en-\\nvironmental impacts and downstream (waste management system)\\nimpacts are linked by mass balance principles and CO\\n2calculations by\\ncoupling the MFA results with LCA literature for assessing the avoidedemissions indicator.\\nThe methodology is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept study for\\nthe city of Trondheim, representing a typical Norwegian city. The\\nfunctional unit is based on a food waste composition analysis for this\\ncity. The conclusions drawn from this study can be applied to other\\nEuropean cities facing the same waste management situation.2. Methodology\\nThis study aims at analysing the performance of two respective\\nstrategies: the transition to a circular economy and waste prevention for\\nthe case of food waste based on three relevant indicators. For doing so,\\nthe downstream and upstream systems are modelled separately. The\\ndownstream model is developed using material ﬂow analysis (MFA)\\nmethodology extended with energy and emission data for assessingrecycling rates, energy e ﬃciencies and emission levels for two di ﬀerent\\nrecycling systems. The upstream model calculates CO\\n2emission from\\nthe food production system, using data from LCA studies in literature.\\nBoth models are tailored to ﬁt the current food waste situation and the\\nactual plans for the city of Trondheim, with the 2017 system as re-ference and alternative scenarios in 2020 and 2025 as comparisons.\\nThis methodology is a proof-of-concept. The full MFA model is pre-\\nsented in S.I.\\nDiﬀerent de ﬁnitions and terms are found in literature when it comes\\nto food wastage. These should be deﬁ ned precisely as they are used in\\nthis paper to avoid any confusion. Note that neither the de ﬁnitions nor\\nthe scope of the study does not include packaging.\\n(1)Food waste is any food, and inedible parts of food, removed from the\\nfood supply chain to be recovered or disposed (including com-\\nposted, crops ploughed in/not harvested, anaerobic digestion, bio-\\nenergy production, co-generation, incineration, disposal to sewer,\\nlandﬁll or discarded to sea) ( Östergren et al., 2014 ).\\n(2)Avoidable food waste refers to materials that could have been eaten,\\nmaking no distinction between what is elsewhere called “possibly\\navoidable ”or“preference loss ”(e.g. peels, seeds). Moreover, food\\nwhich has passed its by-use date is also considered as avoidable, as\\nthe consumer could have planned more e ﬀectively ( Östergren et al.,\\n2014).\\n(3)Unavoidable food waste refers to materials that could not have been\\neaten under normal circumstances, for instance bones and orange\\npeels ( Östergren et al., 2014).\\n(4)Food waste prevention are measures taken before a substance, ma-\\nterial or product has become waste, that reduce: (a) the quantity of\\nwaste, including through the re-use of products or the extension of\\nthe life span of products; (b) the adverse impacts of the generated\\nwaste on the environment and human health; or (c) the content of\\nharmful substances in materials and products\\n(European Commission, 2008).\\n2.1. Case study description\\nAs of 2017, Trondheim had ca 191 000 inhabitants (SSB, 2017), plus\\nsome 10– 15 000 students with another formal home address, and is\\nthereby the third largest city in Norway. A large share of the waste is\\ntoday incinerated, with heat recovery feeding into a district heat net-\\nwork that serves 30% of the space heating demand of the city's build-\\nings. This provides annually some 600 GWh heat supply of which ca\\n80% energy from waste and the remaining 20% from peak load energy\\nsources ( Brattebø and Reenaas, 2012; Lausselet et al., 2016; Varme,\\n2017 ). Currently, paper, plastic, glass, metal, and residual waste are the\\nfractions sorted out from households. There are three main collection\\ntechnologies: surface bins represent the bins on wheel that are placed in\\nfront of each household; underground receptacles represent containers\\nusually placed at a central point in an urban area and serve multiple\\nhouseholds; and vacuum systems that are either stationary or mobile.\\nThese currently collect 83%, 12%, and 5% of the household waste re-spectively. The two latter technologies are underground systems, which\\ntogether aim at reaching a collection capacity of 50% by 2030. Hence,\\norganic waste is currently not sorted out or treated independently but is\\nsent to incineration in the residual waste fraction. The city adminis-\\ntration, however, today investigates the possibilities for building a\\ncentral sorting facility, including the use of near infrared technology,I. de Sadeleer, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 160 (2020) 104908\\n2 aimed at sorting out organic waste for biogas production and plastic\\nwaste for increased ratios of material recycling\\n(Trondheim kommune, 2017 ).\\n2.2. Data acquisition\\nA composition analysis was conducted to estimate the avoidable\\nfood waste amounts contained in household waste in Trondheim. Wastesamples of 400– 500 kg from ﬁve diﬀerent residential areas were col-\\nlected, re ﬂecting the social-demographic di ﬀerences of the city. This\\nwas important as it has been shown that the food waste amounts di ﬀer\\nwith factors such as age, sex, wages and time consumption on foodpreparation ( Stensgård, Prestrud, Jørgen, Og, and Callewaert, 2019 ).\\nThe residual waste was ﬁrst divided into non-food waste and food\\nwaste. The food waste was subsequently categorized as avoidable and\\nunavoidable, as recommended by Lebersorger and Schneider (2011)\\nandBernstad and Cànovas (2015) . Eight avoidable fractions were dis-\\ntinguished: fruits and vegetables, bread and bakeries, ﬁsh, meat, dairy\\nproducts, eggs, meal leftovers, and other usable products, as advocated\\nby the Norwegian national handbook for composition analyses (2015).\\nFor three of the sampling areas, the meal leftover fraction was further\\nclassiﬁed into the categories of bread, ﬁsh and meat, and others in order\\nto get an indication of the amounts of carbon-intensive products presentin that speci ﬁc fraction.\\nA composition vector was developed based on the average of the 5\\nareas, representing the share of unavoidable and avoidable and food\\nwaste fractions divided on the speci ﬁc fractions ( Table 1). Based on\\nweight, the meal leftover fraction was found to be the most importantfraction (28%) of avoidable food waste, followed by fruits and vege-\\ntables (25%) and bread and pastries (21%).\\nHowever, the uncertainties linked to the analysis are likely to be\\nsigniﬁcant due to errors that occurred during the out-sorting process. As\\nthe results are based on the fraction weight, incorrect out-sorting ofheavy products or the inclusion of packaging in ﬂuence the results.\\nNonetheless, the results are comparable to the ones presented in theliterature and therefore considered acceptable for the purpose of this\\nstudy.\\nBernstad and Casanovas ( 2015) present a graph compiling the\\navailable food waste fractions results across the literature. It is di ﬃcult\\nto compare in detail the di ﬀerent studies, as the classi ﬁcation of the\\nfood fractions di ﬀer across the studies, a ﬀecting the percentage-based\\nresults. However, the fruits and vegetable share nearly always the lar-gest, most often followed by bread and pastries and/or prepared food.\\nIn some studies, the categories “diary ”and “others ”were also sig-\\nniﬁcant. The study of Stensgård and Hanssen (2015) was\\n not included\\nin that overview, but the division of the categories and hence the results\\nare comparable to this study. Their result present that the meal leftover\\nfraction was the most important fraction (31%) of the avoidable food\\nwaste, followed by fruits and vegetables (27%) and bread (13%).\\nUnderstanding the composition of the food waste is a ﬁrst step for\\nproposing targeted and e ﬃcient reduction solutions.2.3. Downstream system\\nThe system boundaries are two-fold: the upstream and the down-\\nstream system ( Fig. 1). The ﬁrst one, representing the food production\\nsystem, is described in 2.4.1. The system boundaries of the downstreamsystem include the municipal household waste system for managing\\norganic waste. The system boundaries start with the collection of waste\\nfrom the households. The waste is transported either directly to the\\nincineration facility or to a central sorting facility. In the second option,\\nthe waste is, after further sorting in the central sorting facility, either\\ndirected to a biogas facility or to the incineration plant. The incinera-\\ntion process produces heat which is used for district heating purposes\\nand ashes which are disposed of. The biological treatment produces\\nbiogas which is used as fuel, and digestate which is used as fertilizers as\\nit recovers nitrogen and phosphorus.\\n2.3.1. System boundary description\\n.\\n2.3.2. Model description\\n.\\n2.4. Upstream system\\nFollowing the MFA modelling principles of Brunner and\\nRechberger (2004) , the model “A generic municipal solid waste man-\\nagement model ”developed at NTNU ( Callewaert, 2017 ) was adapted\\nand applied to the organic waste system of the municipality of Trond-\\nheim (see S.I.).\\nThe mass-balanced mathematical model analyses the resource and\\nemission ﬂows in the system, using three di ﬀerent system ﬂow layers\\nfor this system de ﬁnition. First, a material layer quanti ﬁes the annual\\nﬂows of goods (on a waste fractions level) in the system. Second, an\\nenergy layer evaluates the associated ﬂows of energy for each process in\\nthe system. Finally, an emission layer estimates GHG emissions (as CO\\n2-\\neq) from processes, transport and energy consumption. Due to the de-pendency between the layers, it is possible to examine how changes in\\nthe material ﬂows, as a consequence of system changes over time, will\\ninﬂuence the system-wide energy and emission performance.\\nTheﬁrst layer calculates all material ﬂows based on given waste\\nﬂows quantities, on the composition vector and on known or assumed\\ntransfer coe ﬃcients for each process. A transfer coe ﬃcient in MFA\\ntheory determines how much of the sum of in ﬂows to a given process is\\ndirected to a speci ﬁc outﬂow direction. Transfer coe ﬃcients hence tell\\nhow e ﬃcient a process is in directing the waste through ﬂow in the\\ndesired downstream direction.\\nThe calculated material ﬂows are used to estimate the energy ﬂows\\nentering and leaving the system. The energy e ﬃciency of the system is\\ncalculated by dividing the energy generated in incineration and biogasproduction with the feedstock energy from the waste and the con-\\nsumption of energy from waste treatment processes and transport ac-\\ntivities. This is used as an indicator for assessing the overall energy\\nperformance of the system.\\nThe emission layer calculates the generated GHG emissions based\\non the results from the material and energy layer. The emissions in-\\ncluded are caused by waste collection and transport, energy consump-\\ntion during waste treatment processes and direct emissions from AD\\nand incineration. Emissions caused by the life cycle of infrastructure are\\nexcluded. The emission factors are presented in S.I.\\nAdditionally, avoided emissions are calculated based on the quan-\\ntity of energy outputs calculated in the energy layer of the model. Onthe one hand, heat generated from the incineration process is assumed\\nto replace electricity as heating source in households, thanks to district\\nheating in Trondheim. On the other hand, biogas from the AD is as-\\nsumed to substitute diesel in transport. For the substituted products, the\\namounts of energy generated are multiplied with the emission factors ofTable 1\\nComposition vector of the reference scenario 2017.\\nWaste fractions Waste composition\\nkg/cap %\\nBread and pastries 8,61 14%\\nFruits and vegetables 10,05 16%\\nMeat 3,48 6%\\nFish 0,85 1%\\nDairy 2,54 4%\\nOther usable products 3,87 6%\\nEggs 0,16 0%\\nMeal leftovers 11,59 19%\\nUnavoidable food waste 20,07 33%\\nTotal 61,21 100%I. de Sadeleer, et al.

System boundary description\\nBoth the food supply chain and the waste management system are\\nessential in the environmental assessment of food waste prevention\\n(Bernstad and Cànovas, 2015). The upstream system, depicting the food\\nsupply chain, quanti ﬁes the embedded emissions of food commodities\\nin a cradle-to-gate perspective.\\nThe system boundaries of the upstream system follow the ones of\\nClune et al., 2017 ,Fig. 2.\\nAt the farm, inputs from chemicals and fertilizers, fuel and energyinputs from irrigation and machinery for cultivation, harvesting and\\nprocessing are included. In addition, transport and distribution to the\\nregional distribution centre are part of the analysis. Outputs include\\nemissions released from fertilized soils, plants and animals on the ﬁelds.\\nThe infrastructure, however, is not included.\\nIt should be noted that the use phase which includes how consumers\\ntravel to shops, store and cook food is not included in the analysis. Infact, the aim of the study is to quantify the impacts of di ﬀerent political\\nstrategies which are out of reach for consumers. If a share of theavoidable food waste is properly prevented from being wasted at the\\nhousehold level, it can be assumed that the in ﬂow of food commodities\\nto the household is equally reduced. Consequently, it can be consideredthat the same amount of food commodities is avoided from being\\nproduced, and that the associated production-related emissions are\\nFig. 1. Food chain system divided on upstream and downstream systems.\\nFig. 2. System boundaries of the upstream system. Source: Clune et al., 2017 .I. de Sadeleer, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 160 (2020) 104908\\n4 avoided simultaneously. This analysis hence neglects the environmental\\nimpacts arising at the household level.\\n2.4.2. Model description\\nClune et al., 2017 performed a meta-analysis of 369 LCA studies\\npublished between 2000 and 2015, from which they created a GHG\\nemission database for a large quantity of food products. In this study,\\nthe embedded GHG emissions of the di ﬀerent avoidable food waste\\nfractions were calculated ( Table 1) by aggregating the median GWP\\nvalues of the appropriate food products presented by Clune et al., 2017.\\nThe emissions were then multiplied with the composition vector in\\npercent, giving the amount of CO 2eq embedded in one kilo of avoidable\\nfood waste with the typical composition of the food wasted by house-holds in Trondheim. This composition was used as reference composi-\\ntion.\\nIt is unlikely, however, that all food fractions will be equally re-\\nduced by prevention measures. The change within the various fractions\\ntherefore follows the results of the ForMat project ( Stensgård and\\nHanssen, 2015 ). Two composition analyses were conducted in an in-\\nterval of 5 years in the Norwegian city of Fredrikstad and in the Hal-\\nlingdal valley. During this period, food waste prevention measures were\\nactively established. The di ﬀerence in food wastage between the two\\nanalyses was concluded to be a consequence of these measures. Thechange in shares within the composition vector in the various projec-\\ntions is subject to high uncertainty, but is the only available data in a\\nNorwegian waste prevention context. Table 2 presents the new com-\\nposition vector e ﬀected by food waste prevention measures.\\nThe production of the unavoidable food waste fraction is equal for\\nall scenarios and projections and was therefore left out of this study, assuggested by Martinez-Sanchez, Tonini, Møller, and Astrup (2016) .\\nFollowing the same approach as Bernstad and Andersson (2015) , only\\nthe avoidable food waste is prevented. For calculating the embedded\\nemissions from the meal leftover fraction, its composition had to be\\nestimated. During the composition analysis, the meal leftovers were\\nclassiﬁed in three categories: bread, ﬁsh and meat, and others. Based on\\nthe fraction weight, it was estimated that 15% of the meal leftover wasconstituted of bread and pastries, 15% of ﬁsh and meat, and 70% of a\\nmixture of all other fractions, mainly others and fruits and vegetables.The amount of embedded GHG emissions of this fraction was estimated\\nin accordance with this allotment.\\nThe emissions embedded in one kilo of avoidable food waste with\\nthe reference composition amounted to 3.44 kg CO\\n2eq/kg avoidable\\nwasted food. In comparison, the emissions released for producing onekilo of avoidable food waste with the prevention composition amountedto 3.88 kg CO\\n2eq/kg avoidable wasted food. These results are in line\\nwith the literature ( Bernstad and Cànovas, 2015).The di ﬀerence be-\\ntween these two values, i.e. 0.44 kg CO 2eq/kg, represents the change in\\nupstream emissions if the waste composition is altered through pre-vention activities. It can be noted that the embedded emissions of one\\nkilo avoidable food waste increase as the amounts of avoidable food\\nwaste is reduced, which is explained by a reduction of the low-carbonintensive product share (bread and pastries) but a stagnation in the high\\ncarbon-intensive product share (meat, ﬁsh, dairy products).\\n2.5. Scenario development\\nThis study compares 3 main scenarios for the years 2017, 2020 and\\n2025: a Reference scenario (RS), a Central sorting scenario (CS) and aPrevention scenario (PS).\\nReference scenario (RS) - describes the current waste management\\nsolutions in Trondheim in 2017 and assumes these solutions are used\\ntowards 2025. Organic waste is collected together with the residual\\nwaste and sent to incineration for district heating. Projections for 2020\\nand 2025 account for increased population and thereby increased food\\nwaste amounts. The share of collection technologies is adjusted with\\ntime, with above-ground bins decreasing to 80% and 70% for the 2020\\nand 2025 projections respectively, and the underground receptacles\\nand vacuum systems increasing to 14% and 20%, and to 6% and 10%,\\nrespectively. The collection technology inﬂ uences the energy require-\\nment of the collection process. The share of biodiesel used in transportis assumed to rise to 15% in 2020, and to 50% in 2025. The LHV of food\\nwaste is estimated at 2500 kJ/kg for fruits and vegetables, 9200 kJ/kg\\nforﬁsh and meat ( Christensen, 2011) and 4150 kJ/kg for all other\\nfractions ( Hung and Solli, 2012 ). The amount of organic waste per in-\\nhabitant was calculated based on historic organic waste generation data\\nfrom 2007, 2012 and 2015, which show a slight increase over the years.\\nA linear regression was applied and lead to the following: 61.21 kg in\\n2017, 68 kg in 2020 and 71.7 kg in 2025, which were used as reference\\nscenarios for the di ﬀerent years.\\nCentral sorting scenario (CS) –examines the e ﬀects of a new\\ncentral sorting facility separating organic waste and di ﬀerent plastic\\nwaste fractions with optical sorting and near-infrared technologies.\\nCentral sorting facilities are promoted as important technological tools\\nfor increasing collection and hence recycling rates. Variants of this\\ntechnology are currently spreading as state-of-the-art waste manage-\\nment practice in Norway and is therefore of importance to examine\\nmore closely. Based on data from a similar facility at ROAF outside\\nOslo, the organic waste separation e ﬃciency of the facility is set to\\n50%, which re ﬂects the performance of the currently existing tech-\\nnologies ( Callewaert, 2017). Half of the household food waste is thus\\ndirected to the incineration plant together with other waste fractions,while the successfully out-sorted second half is sent to AD for biogas\\nproduction in Verdal, 95 km outside Trondheim. The methane yield of\\nfood waste is assumed to be 153 Nm3/t ( Hung and Solli, 2012 ). Ac-\\ncording to the city's plans, the central sorting facility will not be inoperation before 2025 and is therefore only modelled for this year. The\\ncollection technologies, the share of transport fuel and the LHV of the\\nfood waste fractions are equal to those assumptions used in the RS\\nscenario.\\nPrevention scenario (PS) –investigates the consequences of pre-\\nvention measures, which decrease the amounts of avoidable food waste\\nin 2017, 2020 and 2025 with 10%, 15% and 30% respectively. The\\nmeasures themselves are not deﬁ ned, only the e ﬀects of reduced\\navoidable food waste amounts are analysed. These e ﬀects of prevention\\nare applied also to the CS scenarios, in a combined PS+CS scenario.\\nThe collection technologies, the share of transport fuel and the LHV of\\nthe food waste fractions are equal to the assumptions used in the RS\\nscenario. Like for the reference scenarios, the amount of organic waste\\nper inhabitant for the prevention scenarios were calculated based on\\nhistorical data on which a linear regression was applied. This lead to the\\nfollowing: 56.91 kg in 2017 including 10% reduction, 61.11 kg in 2020\\nincluding 15% reduction and 57.27 kg in 2025 including 30% reduc-\\ntion.\\n2.6.

Results\\nThe results are three-fold according to the three assessed indicators:\\nmaterial recycling, energy e ﬃciency, and emission levels.\\nRegarding recycling rates, there is a common understanding in the\\nEU that these must be increased in a circular economy. In addition to\\nproducing biogas, a biogas facility also creates biorest which recycles\\nnitrogen and phosphorus. The analysed biogas facility uses a dewa-\\ntering system, which leads to the nitrogen leaving the biorest stream.\\nOnly phosphorus is then recycled as fertilizer. However, the biogas\\nfacility under study has done tests regarding the use of liquid biorest,\\nwhich would allow a recovery of the nitrogen in addition to the re-covery of phosphorus ( Ecopro, 2012 ).\\nRegardless of the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus recycled, the\\nEuropean Commission de ﬁnes in the waste legislation that all inputs to\\nthe AD facility are considered “material recycled if the digestate is used as\\nfertilizer in agriculture ”(European Commission, 2011 ). This means that\\nthe scenarios using AD obtain increased recycling rates compared to theRS, as long as the digestate is used as fertilizers.\\nAs a result, CS and PS+CS scenarios reach 50% material recycling\\nfor the food waste fraction on the account that half of the waste is\\ntreated with AD. In comparison, the RS scenario obtains no material\\nrecycling as the total waste amounts are incinerated.\\nThe net energy generation for the three scenarios at all points in\\ntime are presented in Fig. 3, together with the disaggregated con-\\nsumption and generation factors. The net generation (yellow bars) isthe result of the energy generated as biogas and district heating (green\\nbars) minus the energy consumption in transport and processing (blue\\nbars).\\nGiven increased waste amounts, the energy consumption and gen-\\neration are slightly increased over time. Not surprisingly, the preven-\\ntion scenario at all times displays lower e ﬃciencies compared to the RS\\nscenarios because reduced waste amounts lead to reductions in con-sumed and recovered energy.\\nFor all scenarios except the CS scenario, the process energy con-\\nsumption is largely dominant over the transport energy consumption. It\\nis higher in the CS scenario because of the long transport distances to\\nthe biogas facility.\\nEven if AD is capable of recovering slightly higher energy amounts\\nthan incineration (CS and PS+CS scenarios compared to the RS and PS\\nin 2025), the net energy generation is slightly decreased due to the long\\ntransport distances.\\nThe amounts of generated and avoided emissions are presented in\\nFig. 4 for the three scenarios at all points in time. The bars on the upper\\nside of the graph present the amounts of generated emissions, whereasthe bars on the lower side represent the avoided emissions.\\nThe PS 2025 scenario and the PS+CS scenario clearly demonstrates\\nthe largest amounts of avoided emissions across all scenarios. Theprevention of food waste (green bars) has undoubtedly the highest\\nimpact as climate mitigation strategy.\\nThe substitution of diesel with biogas (dark blue bars) also leads toavoided emissions, as does the substitution of electricity with district\\nheating (light blue bars) although to a lesser extent. As diesel has a\\nmuch higher emission factor than electricity, its substitution highly\\nincreases the amounts of avoided emissions. Nonetheless, both sub-\\nstitution options result in far less avoided emissions than the prevention\\nof food waste. The bene ﬁts of fertilizer substitution with digestate was\\nneglected.\\nThe avoided emissions outweigh the generated emissions in all\\nscenarios, except in the current PS scenario. This latter is explained bythe fact that the composition of the food waste arising with the inﬂ u-\\nence of prevention measures include more carbon-intensive products.The prevention activities in the current RS are hence resulting in higher\\nlevels of GHG emissions, as the change in the share of fractions out-\\nweighs the bene ﬁts of 10% reduction in waste amounts.\\nThe amounts of generated emissions are higher in the CS and PS\\n+CS scenarios due to the increase of transport related emissions\\n(yellow bars) compared to the RS and the PS scenarios. Only small\\nemissions are released by the incineration process (orange bars) and the\\nrecycling process (red bars).\\nTo analyse the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis was\\nconducted for the most important parameters ( Table\\n 3). The food waste\\nseparation e ﬃciency of the central sorting facility was analysed in\\nterms of how it in ﬂuences the system recycling and energy e ﬃciencies.\\nAs expected, an e ﬃcient food waste out-sorting in the central sorting\\nfacility is crucial for improving the system recycling e ﬃciency. How-\\never, it turns out to only slightly in ﬂuence (reduce) the system energy\\neﬃciency. The energy e ﬃciency is in fact much more in ﬂuenced by\\nchanges in the methane yield and the LHV of “other food waste frac-\\ntions ”. Regarding emission levels, the emission factor for diesel used in\\ntransport was found to be very sensitive, as most of the waste truck ﬂeet\\nis fuelled on diesel.\\n4. Discussion\\nThis chapter ﬁrst discusses the results and assumptions used in the\\nstudy. Second, the limitations of the methodology are reviewed.\\nThe system boundaries in this study exclude the household level,\\nwith storage in refrigerators and food preparation. As the meal leftover\\nfraction stands for the largest share of avoidable food waste, its pre-\\nvention would also in ﬂuence the amount of energy consumed. Further,\\nthe study did not account for the rebound e ﬀect. As households spend\\nless on food when food waste is prevented, the environmental impacts\\nmight be reallocated with spending on other products. This aspect\\nshould be taken into account for a holistic environmental policy de-\\nvelopment.\\nComparing avoided emissions from improved waste management\\nsystems with the ones obtained from food waste prevention o ﬀer in-\\nsights in the environmental potential of upstream versus downstreamclimate change mitigation strategies. In that regard, prevention strate-\\ngies clearly result in larger bene ﬁts than recycling strategies. 30% re-\\nduction in avoidable food waste gave more than 5 times larger bene ﬁts\\nthan what was obtained with improved recycling strategies in the CS\\nscenario. It must be noted that these conclusions are based on the as-\\nsumption that a reduction in food waste leads to a reduction of food\\nproduction. Avoided emission from the food production process was\\nhence the determining factor for the overall bene ﬁts of food waste\\nprevention, as observed also by Bernstad and Andersson (2015) ;\\nGentil, Gallo, and Christensen (2011) andMatsuda et al. (2012) . There\\nis however a risk that the amount of food waste prevented at thehousehold level will arise higher up in the food chain, e.g. at the retailor production level. Such a shift in waste production will hence not\\nprevent any GHG emissions –it is then necessary to have good waste\\nmanagement recycling systems in place, and therefrom avoid emissionsthrough substituting carbon intensive products.\\nCombining prevention measures and a switch to AD would, none-\\ntheless, o ﬀer optimal solutions for food waste management based onI. de Sadeleer, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 160 (2020) 104908\\n6 the analysed indicators. It must be noted that the AD process depends\\non food waste as feedstock. Investing in a biogas facility will create amarket for the food waste and might therefore not incentivize the\\nprevention and reduction of food waste at the household level.\\nFurther, analysing the di ﬀerences between the RS 2025 and CS 2025\\nscenarios, excluding the upstream prevention results, allows for a\\ncomparison of the performance of the household food wastemanagement systems for the three assessed indicators.\\nFirst, in accordance with the de ﬁnition of the EU\\n(European Commission, 2011), AD is the only treatment option re-\\nsulting in material recycling. The sensitivity analysis disclosed that theeﬀectiveness of the central sorting facility is a crucial parameter, highly\\naﬀecting the recycling rate. Optionally, organic waste can be collected\\nin separate bins and directly transported to a biogas facility, avoiding\\nFig. 3. Energy consumption, generation and net energy consumption for all scenarios.\\nFig. 4. Total emissions generated and avoided in kg CO 2eq for all scenarios.I. de Sadeleer, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 160 (2020) 104908\\n7 the diversion through a central sorting facility. Based on the experi-\\nences from ROAF, this would reduce the contamination of the other\\nwaste fractions, especially paper and plastics, allowing for overall\\nhigher recycling rates ( Callewaert, 2017; Unander, 2017).\\nSecond, it is bene ﬁcial to recover the feedstock energy present in\\nfood waste, as the generated energy amounts largely outweigh con-\\nsumed energy across all scenarios. Even though the AD process gen-\\nerates slightly more energy than the incineration process, the CS sce-\\nnario requires higher energy amounts because of the longer driving\\ndistance to the biogas facility, causing the total energy e ﬃciency to\\ndecrease. The LHV, and especially the methane yield, were found to bequite sensitive parameters. The latter was assumed to be slightly\\noverestimated ( Hung and Solli, 2012 ), which might have given too high\\nenergy amounts generated for the AD process. However, the biogasfacility in the case study operates with co-digestion: a feedstock mix\\nconsisting of sewage sludge, organic household waste and ﬁsh sludge.\\nThis mix delivers higher amounts of biogas than if only organic wastewas used as input ( Edwards et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the methane yield\\nin use is higher than if only food waste would have been digested. Inaddition, it should be taken into account that the energy recovery from\\nincineration can easily be connected to a heat or electricity grid. In\\ncomparison, biogas and fertilizers from digestate are not necessarily\\nconvenient to use without any infrastructural changes and due to pre-\\nmature markets or policy constraints. This might lead to the results of\\nthe study being more theoretical than practically implementable.\\nThird, when comparing generated emissions with avoided emis-\\nsions, it is clear that the avoided emissions outweigh the generated onesin all scenarios. Nonetheless, the net bene ﬁt of the CS scenario is 5\\ntimes greater than of the RS scenario. From an emission perspective, itis hence bene ﬁcial to treat food waste by AD rather than by incinera-\\ntion, even though the generated emissions are larger in the CS scenario.It can be concluded that substituting diesel is more advantageous than\\nsubstituting electricity. It must be noted that the Norwegian electricity\\nmix was applied, in ﬂuencing the results by its low carbon-intensity.\\nThis assumption in ﬂuences the di ﬀerence between the scenario results\\nmore than it would if the Nordic or European electricity mix had been\\napplied. In addition, the sensitivity analysis disclosed that both the\\nemission factors for diesel and electricity were in ﬂuential, especially\\nthe latter one, which might also contribute to overestimate the lowemissions of the CS scenario. Additionally, the avoided emissions of the\\nCS scenario would have been increased if the substation of fertilizers\\nwith digestate had been included.\\nThe emission factor for diesel is rather in ﬂuential on overall emis-\\nsion results. This can explain the high values of the transport process in\\nthe CS scenario, where driving distance is decisive. An option for re-\\nducing the consumed energy amounts would be to either have a nearer\\nlocation of the AD facility, to fuel the trucks entirely on biogas or an-\\nother type of carbon neutral fuel, or to transport the waste by train.\\nThe methodology in use has clear limitations. The presented MFA\\nmodel is more appropriate for modelling complex waste management\\nsystems with several waste fractions. The downstream indicators giverelatively straightforward results for the analysed scenarios, but thelinks between them are not always obvious. The MFA system con-\\nsistently allows analysing these trade-o ﬀs, but is not used to its full\\npotential when applied to this simpli ﬁed system.\\nIn addition, the analysis would have been strengthened by a cost-\\nbeneﬁt analysis. However, the literature shows that using food waste\\nfor biogas production is socioeconomically pro ﬁtable compared to in-\\ncineration ( NIRAS, 2013 ; Randby, 2016). Therefore, Norwegian au-\\nthorities have proposed a regulation on the sorting of food waste from\\nhouseholds ( Miljødirektoratet, 2018 ). In this regard, a cost-bene ﬁt\\nanalysis\\ncomparing di ﬀerent treatment methods of food waste would\\nnot have political in ﬂuence, as the question has already been debated\\nupon. In the European context, the same argumentation yields: becausethe Circular Economy Package requires higher amounts of recycled\\nmaterials which can only obtained for food waste with biogas produc-\\ntion, the cost would not have a real in ﬂuence. A cost-bene ﬁt of pre-\\nvention measures compared to recycling measures would however beenof interest and is suggested as further research.\\nIn the author's eyes, the most interesting result is the comparison of\\nthe avoided emissions obtained by the upstream and various down-\\nstream strategies. It can be argued that an LCA would have been a more\\nrobust and appropriate methodology for analysing this question. The\\naim of this study was however to analyse di ﬀerent indicators for the\\ndownstream system in the context of a transition to a circular economy;and compare the energy and emission performance with the potential\\nupstream energy and emission savings. For this aim, we view the pre-sented methodology as robust.\\nOne should be cautious in applying the actual values presented in\\nthe results chapter. Due to the uncertainties introduced with the com-\\nposition analysis, this study only aims at ranking the performance of the\\nvarious strategies and reveal critical parameters that in ﬂuence the\\noverall performance level.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe environmental bene ﬁts of household food waste prevention\\nwere compared to the bene ﬁts from various waste management stra-\\ntegies in regard to recycling rates, energy e ﬃciency and emission e ﬃ-\\nciency, using MFA methodology combined with published LCA results.\\nThe method was demonstrated as a proof-of-concept case study for the\\ncity of Trondheim, Norway. In a reference scenario, food waste is\\ntreated together with residual waste and sent to incineration. A central\\nsorting facility is introduced in a central sorting scenario, aiming at out-\\nsorting parts of the household food waste for use as feedstock in biogas\\nproduction. A food waste prevention scenario was also tested, con-sidering the e ﬀects of a reduction of 10%, 15% and 30% avoidable food\\nwaste in 2017, 2020 and 2025, respectively.\\nThe most e ﬀective food waste management strategy seems to be a\\ncombination of prevention and recycling strategies. On the one hand,focus should primarily be on prevention strategies for mitigating cli-\\nmate change.

On the other hand, emphasis should\\nbe placed on the use of AD for biogas production as the future waste\\nrecycling option.

Introduction\\nHousehold waste management (HWM) has been a major chal-\\nlenge for governments across developing countries. Population\\ngrowth, rapid urbanisation, economic development, and rising\\nstandards of living in cities have greatly increased solid waste\\ngeneration across the globe ( Minghua et al., 2009 ), especially in\\nurban areas ( Xu et al., 2016 ). These trends pose challenges, partic-\\nularly for environmental protection and sustainable development.\\nA possible solution to overcome the challenges is to adopt a sus-\\ntainable HWM system in line with the cleaner production (CP)\\nconcept and circular economy (CE) philosophy. CP approaches aim\\nto contribute to sustainable development by means of increased\\nproduction ef ﬁciencies, improved environmental management,and sustainable societal development ( Hens et al., 2018 ). The CP\\napproaches are key to achieving the CE vision, in which waste is\\nconsidered a resource for value recovery ( Veleva et al., 2017 ;\\nFarooque et al., 2019b ). Both CP and CE have received increasing\\nworldwide attention and feature prominently in Chinese and Eu-\\nropean governmental policies ( McDowall et al., 2017 ;Hens et al.,\\n2018 ;Farooque et al., 2019b ).\\nIn the context of sustainable HWM, source separation by the\\nperson who disposes of the rubbish has been widely accepted as an\\nethical behaviour ( Xu et al., 2017 ) and best practice for reducing,\\nreusing, and recycling waste ( Karim Ghani et al., 2013 ;Zhang and\\nWen, 2014b ;Yuan et al., 2016 ). Previous research has analysed\\nand compared various collection systems for source-separated\\nhousehold waste in many developed countries such as Japan\\n(Matsumoto, 2011 ), Sweden ( Dahl /C19en et al., 2007 ), and Spain\\n(Gallardo et al., 2010 ,2012 ). Relevant studies in China have sug-\\ngested that source separation makes recycling more ef ﬁcient (e.g.,\\nbetter quality compost and recyclables) ( Zhang and Wen, 2014a )\\nand optimises incineration operations ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ).*Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: bill.wang@aut.ac.nz (B.

All rights reserved.Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773 Furthermore, an increased rate of source separation improves the\\nvalue recovery from waste ﬂows and facilitates a move towards a CE\\n(Ranta et al., 2018 ).\\nChina, the world ’s largest generator of municipal solid waste\\n(MSW) ( Wang, Y. et al., 2018 ), has been encouraging source sepa-\\nration of household solid waste (approximately 80% of MSW)\\nthrough policy instruments and directives ( Zhang and Wen, 2014b ).\\nIn the past two decades, several source separation pilot projects\\nhave been carried out in a number of Chinese cities. However, most\\nof these projects have failed except for some very recent projects\\nwhere accountability mechanisms were integrated through the use\\nof Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies ( Xu, 2017 ). The extant\\nliterature has primarily focused on identifying the factors inhibiting\\nthe successful implementation of the earlier pilot projects ( Zhang\\nand Wen, 2014b ;Zeng et al., 2016 ;Xiao et al., 2017 ), instead of\\nunderstanding the reasons for success in the most recent pilot\\nprojects. On the other hand, Knickmeyer (2020) argues that suc-\\ncessful implementation of source separation projects require a\\ndeeper understanding of public (household) behaviours and atti-\\ntudes towards ethical approaches to waste separation ( Xu et al.,\\n2017 ). A number of studies have attempted to identify the ante-\\ncedents ( Wang, Z. et al., 2018 ), inﬂuencing factors ( Zhang et al.,\\n2017 ), and key determinants ( Xu et al., 2017 ) of waste sorting be-\\nhaviours at the individual and household levels. However, the\\nbehavioural aspects of accountability and ethics has been largely\\noverlooked.\\nWhile there are many ways to establish accountability mecha-\\nnisms in a given setting, in recent years, the application of IoT\\ntechnologies has received growing attention ( Boos et al., 2013 ).\\nDespite some implementation barriers, the use of smart enabling\\ntechnologies, including IoT in waste management, has been iden-\\ntiﬁed as one of the pathways towards a CE ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). In\\nthis regard, IoT technologies can offer dual bene ﬁts: they facilitate\\nthe establishment of an accountability mechanism and they can\\nalso support the transition towards smart waste management for a\\nCE. No prior research exists, as far as the authors of this paper know,\\nthat links household waste source separation (HWSS) with\\naccountability and IoT technologies.\\nThis study aims to conceptualise IoT-enabled accountability in\\nHWSS. Inspired by the recent success of implementing IoT tech-\\nnologies in several HWM projects in China, this study addresses a\\nkey question: How do IoT technologies enable accountability in\\nHWSS?\\nThis paper focuses on residential everyday household waste in\\ntypical residential communities in Chinese cities, where many\\nfamilies live in apartment buildings managed by an estate man-\\nagement organisation. The following research objectives drive this\\npaper:\\nRO1: To establish the concept of IoT-enabled accountability in\\nHWSS.\\nRO2: To develop theoretical propositions on the multiple di-\\nmensions of IoT-enabled accountability mechanisms in HWSS.\\nThis paper adopts a case study approach to answer the research\\nquestion and to achieve the research objectives. It presents four\\ncases from different parts of China to establish the concept of IoT-\\nenabled accountability in HWSS. By utilising the lens of account-ability theory, this study is a major departure from the prior liter-\\nature which has utilised various behavioural theory lenses (such as\\nthe theory of planned behaviour) to predict and explain behaviour\\nrequired for source separation of household waste rather than\\nfocusing on ways of shaping this behaviour. By drawing on the\\nmultiple dimensions of accountability as a mechanism, this\\nresearch advances several propositions to provide speci ﬁ\\nc answers\\nto the “how ”type of research question from different perspectives.\\nIn addition to offering new theoretical contributions to theliterature on source separation, this paper makes important prac-\\ntical contributions by identifying appropriate solutions to chal-\\nlenging HWM problems that occur in China and in other countries.\\nIt also provides insights to researchers and policymakers on how to\\novercome the behavioural challenges in source separation for\\nsustainable HWM through the innovative use of IoT technologies.\\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2\\nreviews the relevant literature. Section 3presents the research\\nmethod and case data. Section 4conducts case analyses and pro-\\nposes several propositions on IoT-enabled accountability. Section 5\\ndiscusses the research and practical implications before Section 6\\nconcludes the research.\\n2. Literature review2.1. Accountability theory\\nAccountability theory explains how the perceived need to justify\\none ’s behaviours to another party (that has the authority to\\nadminister rewards or punishments), causes one to consider and\\nfeel accountable for the process by which decisions and judgmentshave been reached ( Tetlock, 1992 ;Vance et al., 2015 ). As a result,\\nthe likelihood that one will think deeply and systematically about\\none ’s procedural behaviours increases signi ﬁcantly ( Vance et al.,\\n2015 ).\\nAccording to Vance et al. (2013 ,2015) , accountability theory\\nproposes four major dimensions of accountability mechanisms:\\nidenti ﬁability, expectation of evaluation, awareness of monitoring,\\nand social presence. Identi ﬁability is the individual ’s“knowledge\\nthat his outputs could be linked to him ”(Williams et al., 1981 ,p .\\n309). Hence, individuals modify their behaviours if they believe\\ntheir identity might be revealed in the process ( Reicher and Levine,\\n1994 ).Expectation of evaluation is the belief that one ’s“perfor-\\nmance will be assessed by another [party] according to some\\nnormative ground rules and with some implied consequences ”\\n(Lerner and Tetlock, 1999 , p. 255). This expectation increases so-\\ncially desirable behaviours in individuals ( Lerner and Tetlock, 1999 ;\\nHochwarter et al., 2007 ).Monitoring is the process of watching or\\ntracking an individual user ’s activities ( Grifﬁth, 1993 ). An aware-\\nness of monitoring fosters the expectation of evaluation (\\nVance\\net al., 2015 ).Social presence is the awareness of other users in the\\nsystem ( Walther, 1992 ). It is widely accepted that individuals\\nexhibit increased conformist behaviour in the presence of another\\nperson even when that person is not directly present and cannot be\\nobserved ( Bond and Titus, 1983 ).\\nAccording to Ferris et al. (1995) , the source of accountability\\nmay be internal or external to the actor. When individuals perceive\\ninternal accountability, the obligation to perform certain behav-\\niours is caused by the actor ’s own commitment to the behaviour.\\nHence, no formal control mechanism is required and, rather, in-\\ndividuals act out of a sense of personal control ( Dose and Klimoski,\\n1995 ). Conversely, under external accountability, actors feel\\nresponsible and obligated to perform certain behaviours because\\nthey are expected to do so by others. Thus, an external controlsystem would be required to satisfy the accountability demands\\n(Erdogan et al., 2004 ;Merchant and Otley, 2006 ;Boos et al., 2013 ).\\nInsights from control theories suggest that human actors can\\nonly be held accountable if they can understand, predict and in-\\nﬂuence work processes ( Grote, 2009 ). In the case of perceived in-\\nternal accountability, theories suggest that actors should only be\\nheld accountable for outcomes if they had the freedom to choose\\nbetween two or more alternatives and to act in a chosen manner\\n(Boos et al., 2013 ). In this way, individuals feel that they have\\nenough control over the situation to achieve the end results ( Dose\\nand Klimoski, 1995 ). In cases of perceived external accountability,B. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\\n2 however, the expectations must be appropriately structured and\\nexplicitly communicated prior to the performance period for actors\\nto assume responsibility ( Dose and Klimoski, 1995 ;Merchant and\\nOtley, 2006 ). During the performance period, the evaluators\\nmonitor reports of what the individuals were being held account-\\nable for. Mitchell (1993) argues that, for accountability to have an\\ninﬂuence on behaviour, there is a need to associate a reward or\\npunishment system based on the individual ’s performance. This\\nwould make the evaluation process more meaningful to the actors.\\nThus, behaviour results from control mechanisms, including\\nperceived accountability ( Beu and Buckley, 2001 ).\\n2.2. Accountability and IoT technologies\\nWhen accountability is used for monitoring and evaluation\\npurposes, IoT technologies are considered to be key enablers of the\\ncontrol capabilities of the actor demanding the accountability\\n(Winthereik et al., 2007 ;Bose et al., 2009 ;Boos et al., 2013 ). The IoT\\nrefers to an integrated network of physical objects that are equip-\\nped with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity\\nfunctionalities so that they are able to connect and exchange data(Atzori et al., 2010 ). IoT technologies can generate large amounts of\\ngranular and accurate real-time data automatically ( Brous et al.,\\n2020 ), which is very important in the accountability process. For\\nexample, automatic identi ﬁcation and data capture (AIDC) tech-\\nnology, one of the key elements in IoT, is able to automatically\\nidentify objects without human involvement, in order to collect\\ndata ( Stojkoska and Trivodaliev, 2017 ). IoT technologies make\\ncertain aspects of the work process –which previously may have\\nbeen considered to be inaccessible and opaque –visible and\\navailable for analysis. For example, big data powered by IoT tech-\\nnologies (e.g., sensors and devices) coupled with supply chain an-\\nalytics can be used to discover new insights for better and faster\\ndecision-making based on data that was previously inaccessible\\nor unusable ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). In principle, this characteristic of\\nIoT technologies is well-aligned with the accountability mechanism\\nwhich attempts to make the invisible visible ( Munro, 1996 ). How-\\never, it is important to evaluate the IoT application used for\\naccountability in the ﬁrst instance, as the extent of control depends\\non the capacities of the technology in use ( Boos et al., 2013 ).\\n2.3. Accountability and household waste source separation\\nSource separation of household waste is considered an effective\\nmethod for enhancing recycling and minimising waste ( Chung and\\nPoon, 2001 ). According to Gu et al. (2015) , the recyclable compo-\\nnent of household solid waste may reach up to 89.3%. Hence,\\nincreased levels of household-level source separation can facilitate\\nthe transition towards CE. Given their huge potential in achieving\\nsustainable development, many developed countries use system-\\natic and integrated waste source separation programs ( Xu et al.,\\n2017 ). However, low recycling rates of household solid waste\\nhave been observed and reported in the extant literature ( Fan et al.,\\n2019 ). For example, the cross-country report of MSW in 32 Euro-\\npean countries indicates that eight member countries achieved a\\nrecycling rate of less than 10%, eleven countries recycle between10% and 20%, seven countries between 20% and 30%, and only six\\ncountries achieve material recycling levels that are higher than 30%\\n(European Environment Agency, 2013 ). Similarly, the recycling rate\\nin the United States is equivalent to 35.2% ( United States\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 2017 ).\\nUntil now, most efforts (both academic and practical) to improve\\nsource-separated collection rate can be classi ﬁed into two main\\nstreams. The ﬁrst stream has been focused on exploring charac-\\nteristics of an effective HWSS program, including strategies,methods, practices, and impact assessments (see, for example,\\nBernstad et al., 2011 ;Rousta et al., 2015 ;Eriksen et al., 2019 ;\\nPedersen and Manhice, 2020 ). The second stream has been focused\\non understanding the behavioural factors affecting household\\nwaste separation at source, including public assessing, public\\nawareness, opinion, and attitudes (see, for example, Sekito et al.,\\n2013 ;Bernstad, 2014 ;Parizeau et al., 2015 ;Xiao et al., 2017 ).\\nHowever, technology deployment (for example, IoT applications)\\nfor improving source-separated collection rate as evident from the\\nrecent successful pilot projects has not been reported in the aca-\\ndemic literature. It is also argued that household waste separation\\nat source requires considerable behavioural change and effort from\\nindividual households ( Karim Ghani et al., 2013 ). This is dif ﬁcult to\\nachieve in the absence of a reliable accountability mechanism.\\nThe accountability concept has a widespread application across\\nvarious disciplines, including environmental and social issues that\\ninvolve multiple stakeholders ( Tomasini Rolando, 2004 ;Parmigiani\\net al., 2011 ;Spence and Rinaldi, 2014 ).Zakaria (2011) suggests that\\nstakeholder engagement has a great potential to in ﬂuence\\naccountability in complex systems. As a major subset of municipal\\nsolid waste management, HWM is a truly complex system withsigniﬁcant environmental and social impacts. It involves multiple\\nstakeholders, including governments, enterprises, non-\\ngovernmental organisations, waste collectors, residents, and so\\non (Xu et al., 2015 ). Therefore, stakeholder engagement and inter-\\naction with an effective accountability mechanism become\\nextremely important for the success of HWM source separation\\nprojects.\\n2.4. IoT applications in CE and waste management\\nIn transitioning to a CE, IoT technologies can facilitate the\\nmanagement of restorative and regenerative resource ﬂows. IoT is\\nable to help with the collection of data generated from various\\nsensors such as smart meters so that stakeholders across the value\\nchain can be connected ( Pagoropoulos et al., 2017 ). IoT not only\\nprovides real-time data, it re ﬂects the consequences of particular\\nactions by stakeholders. Thus, CE models based on IoT-captured\\ndata may be established for evaluation throughout the lifecycle of\\ncertain products such as smartphones ( Alcayaga et al., 2019 ).\\nRecently, researchers and practitioners refer to the concept of a\\n‘smart CE ’, which is enabled by key technologies such as IoT.\\nKristoffersen et al. (2020) presented a smart circular strategies\\nframework for manufacturing companies using IoT which is used\\nfor aligning activities across the CE and information systems. Its\\ncapacity for data collection has led to the wide usage of IoT for\\nsupporting the CE in terms of system development and imple-\\nmentation (\\nLin et al., 2019 ;Rajput and Singh, 2019 ).\\nSome real-life cases of adopting IoT in CE for sustainability have\\nbeen reported. For example, Fatimah et al. (2020) introduced an\\nadvanced technology like an IoT-based sustainable CE method from\\nIndonesia for a smart waste management system. IoT technology\\nhas also been used in waste management ( Hong et al., 2014 ;\\nMedvedev et al., 2015 ;Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017 ) to achieve\\nsustainability in smart cities ( Al-Turjman et al., 2019 ). Arguably, the\\ninformation collection ef ﬁciencies and high levels of data sharing\\nthat has been achieved through IoT technology has made feasible\\ndata-driven decision-making models. Gonz /C19alez-Briones et al.\\n(2020) proposed an agent-based IoT platform to encourage citi-\\nzen participation in recycling tasks through gami ﬁcation mecha-\\nnisms. The work was mainly motivated by the lack of a common\\nmethod of waste management in the European Union. Similarly,\\n‘Heat Wave Mitigation in M /C19etropole de Lyon ’, reported by Robert\\net al. (2017) , is a recent example of an IoT-enabled smart city.\\nThis example is based on the European Union Horizon 2020B. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\\n3 program, aiming to improve the interoperability between a number\\nof system components. Kang et al. (2020) discussed the applica-\\nbility of an IoT-enabled smart collection system to manage house-\\nhold e-waste in the Malaysian e-waste recycling sector. This system\\nimproves the ef ﬁciency and effectiveness of household waste\\nmanagement in terms of saving time and maximising the uti-\\nlisation of equipment such as trucks. Centenaro et al. (2016)\\nintroduced some IoT scenarios for typical smart city applications\\nin terms of ef ﬁciency, effectiveness, and architectural design. Hong\\net al. (2014) presented an IoT-enabled smart garbage system,\\npiloted in Seoul, the Republic of Korea, for ef ﬁcient food waste\\nmanagement. The system was capable of exchanging the IoT-\\ncaptured data using wireless mesh networks, and the data could\\nbe analysed for service provisioning. Anagnostopoulos et al. (2017)\\ndiscussed the challenges and opportunities of waste management\\nin the IoT-enabled smart cities based on a survey study in the city of\\nSt. Petersburg, Russia. They focused on IoT-enabled smart devices\\nand proposed a novel framework for waste management. Wen et al.\\n(2018) presented a case study of an IoT network system for\\nrestaurant food waste management in Suzhou, China. This system\\nhas been running for some years and has achieved signi ﬁcant\\nbeneﬁts, including a 20.5% increase in food waste collection.\\n2.5. Research gaps\\nA thorough review of the literature suggests that IoT-enabled\\naccountability for sustainable HWSS is an emerging research\\ntopic. The following research gaps were identi ﬁed, which moti-\\nvated the authors to conduct this research.\\n1. In the extant literature, HWSS is highly regarded as an effective\\nmethod for recovering value from waste ﬂows and facilitating\\nthe transition towards a CE. Despite an abundance of research\\non HWSS, the low rate of HWSS is a commonly reported issue in\\nmany countries including China, which is the context of the\\ncurrent study. Evidence from very recent pilot projects suggests\\nthat technology deployment (i.e., IoT applications) has played a\\nsigniﬁcant role in improving the source-separated collection\\nrate. However, such cases have not been reported in the aca-\\ndemic literature.\\n2. Most of the research efforts to date have been put into pre-\\ndicting and explaining the behaviour required for source sepa-\\nration of household waste. Invariably, the questions such as\\n“what shapes an ethical HWSS behaviour ”and “how does\\ntechnology deployment shape an ethical HWSS behaviour ”\\nremain unexplored.\\n3. The majority of the source separation pilot projects carried out\\nin several Chinese cities in the last decade or so have failed to be\\neffective except for some very recent projects where account-\\nability mechanisms were integrated through IoT technologies.\\nHowever, IoT technologies ’role in enabling accountability in\\nHWSS remains unclear in the literature.\\n3. Research method and data\\nFig. 1 outlines the methodological procedures of the research.\\nThis study adopts a qualitative research approach using multiple\\ncase studies for two reasons. First, there is scant research exploring\\nIoT-enabled accountability in HWSS, although IoT technologies and\\naccountability have been studied separately. In focusing on how IoT\\ntechnologies enable accountability in HWSS in China, this study\\naims to contextualise, interpret and understand the innermechanism through inductive reasoning in order to generate a new\\ntheory ( Yilmaz, 2013 ). Qualitative research methods, such as mul-\\ntiple case studies, are appropriate for this under-investigated topic,\\nas case studies can “present data of real-life situations and provide\\nbetter insights into the detailed behaviour of the subjects of in-\\nterest ”(Zainal, 2007 , p.5). Second, HWSS has emerged as a major\\nchallenge for many countries across the world, including developed\\ncountries such as Japan, Germany, and the United States. Since\\n1997, China has attempted to implement HWSS systems, but most\\nof the pilot projects had achieved poor results ( Zhang et al., 2008 ),\\nexcept for some trials of IoT smart HWSS systems in the last four\\nyears. Given the limited evidence of successful HWSS projects in\\nChina to date, there is a need to adopt a more exploratory approach,\\nfor which a qualitative method is more suitable.\\nFollowing the replication methodological logic, multiple case\\nstudies can either predict similar case results to strengthen the\\nemerging theory, or generate contrasting results to extend theory\\n(Yin, 2011 ). As advised by Eisenhardt (1989) , the researchers\\nselected four cases which were suf ﬁcient for generalising empirical\\nﬁndings while avoiding the data complexity resulting from too\\nmany cases.\\n3.1. Case selection\\nCase selection was purposive and theoretically directed ( Strauss\\nand Corbin, 1998 ) based on the following criteria: (1) the\\ngeographic setting: considering China has a vast territory, cases\\nwere selected to represent major areas including the east coast\\n(Case A), the capital city in the northern area (Case B), the western\\narea (Case C), and the southern area (Case D); (2) successful out-\\ncomes: the researchers selected cases which have successfully\\nstrengthened accountability; (3) the system had to be in practice\\nfor a minimum of three years. Table 1 summarises the main char-\\nacteristics of the four cases. Pro ﬁles of each case are provided\\nbelow.\\nCase A. In 2012, a source separation project started in the\\nHuachuan residential community, Ningbo. Despite source separa-\\ntion promotion and education campaigns, a breakthrough in\\nchanging the residents ’waste disposal behaviours did not occur\\nuntil IoT technology was introduced. Since 2016, 2D barcodes\\nunique to each household in the residential community have been\\nprinted on all rubbish bags. A database was established to track the\\nuser of each rubbish bag. Every morning at 8 a.m., a community\\nworker visits the rubbish collection point to conduct a sampling\\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of research methodology.B. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\\n4 check of about 50 e80 rubbish bags on source separation. He uses\\nan app installed on a smartphone to scan the 2D barcodes on the\\nrubbish bags to identify the owners. If any noncompliance is\\nidenti ﬁed in rubbish sorting, the community management acts to\\nre-educate the noncompliant users. Some volunteers from the\\ncommunity have also been actively involved in educating and\\nassisting their neighbours in source separation. The IoT-enabled\\nsystem rewards credit points to compliant residents. The commu-\\nnity management regularly gives awards to the best-performing\\nhouseholds and publicizes the names of winners. Because of the\\naccountability achieved through the innovative use of IoTtechnology, the source separation rate has steadily improved,\\nreaching above 70% in less than two years.\\nCase B. An IoT source separation project started at Xinyi Homes\\nresidential community, East-City, Beijing in 2018. Governmental\\norganisations such as street agencies, administrative of ﬁces, and\\nenforcement departments work together to advance the project.\\nThey run education campaigns to promote the source separation\\nproject by using an IoT system for different users: smartphone users\\ncan download a “separation ”application to register their identi ﬁ-\\ncations (ID) while non-smartphone users can register their IDs from\\na local street agency and obtain a barcode card.

Before\\ndisposing household waste, a resident needs to verify their identity\\nby using smartphone to scan a 2D barcode on the machine (a non-\\nsmartphone user can scan his/her low-carbon card from the system\\nto verify their identity). Then, the machine will open its collection\\ndoor. The smart equipment can recognise the waste type (glass,\\nmetal, plastics, paper, textile, kitchen waste, and other) and weigh\\nthe waste and reward the compliant resident with credits. The\\ncredits earned can be used for shopping in the local markets and\\ncan even be withdrawn as cash from local banks. The system runs\\non a cloud-based platform. It can monitor whether the IoT collec-\\ntion containers have been fully loaded or not. The fully loaded IoT\\ncontainers can automatically send signals to the control centre for\\narranging timely collection. It can also improve route management\\nby tracking how trucks collect the waste from stations.\\n3.2. Data collection, validation, and analysis\\nThis research uses secondary data. Secondary data has its dis-\\nadvantages because it has been collected by others for different\\npurposes but for the context of this study, it offers relevant infor-\\nmation to address the research questions posed and it enables a\\nmeans of understanding and explaining the research problem at\\nhand ( Ghauri and Gronhaug, 2005 ) The objective of exploring how\\nIoT technologies enable accountability in HWSS is served by the\\ndata drawn from over ten reliable sources for each case (see the\\naccompanying Supplementary Data). The collected data elaborate\\nthe entire process ﬂow and illustrate how IoT systems can compel\\nthe accountability of residents and collectors in HWSS. The data\\nalso show how stakeholders, such as the government and its\\nrespective organisations, help to train, educate, re-educate, reward\\nand/or punish to enforce the accountability of residents in IoT\\nHWSS systems.\\nValidity and reliability tests have also been performed in this\\nstudy. In terms of constructive validity, multiple sources ofevidence were applied to triangulate the data, including webpages\\ndescribing the IoT systems, and of governmental and semi-\\ngovernmental organisations, in addition to catalogues and maga-\\nzines articles ( Ghauri and Gronhaug, 2005 ). The draft report was\\nalso reviewed by four researchers. Internal validity was enhanced\\nthrough (1) a clear research framework (refer to Fig. 1 ); (2) dis-\\ncussing the ﬁndings among the researchers; (3) triangulating to\\nconﬁrm the emerging ﬁndings; and (4) re ﬁning the theoretical\\norientation of the research. External validity is improved by (1)\\nrationale for the case selection (refer to 3.1); (2) details of the case\\nstudy context; (3) the case study being guided by the accountability\\ntheory (refer to section 2.1\\n); and (4) comparing across the four case\\nstudies. The development of the case study database (refer to the\\naccompanying Supplementary Data) also serves to enhance the\\nreliability of this study ’sﬁndings.\\nThe data coding and analysis proceeded through two main\\nphases. Firstly, the researchers searched more than ten secondary\\ndata sources for each case and scrutinised them to identify the\\nconceptual themes that emerged. Then, the researchers with Chi-\\nnese and English language skills analysed the descriptive tran-\\nscripts and coded for conceptual content on the identi ﬁed themes\\nincluding accountability, reward, and punishment. Data analysis\\nwas an iterative process between reviewing theoretical concepts\\nand identifying patterns in the case data. Finally, the results were\\nanalysed and synthesised into case ﬁndings.\\n4. Case analysis and research propositions\\nThe four IoT HWSS cases (A-D) have been analysed and Fig. 2\\nprovides an overview how the six resulting propositions have\\nbeen induced and synthesised into a theoretical framework. The\\nframework integrates multiple dimensions of IoT-enabled\\naccountability and depicts the relationships between the account-\\nability dimensions. The detail of the induction is described as\\nfollows.\\nAlthough the four cases (A-D) differ from each other in their\\nlocation, sample populations, history, and the technologies used,\\nthere are some commonalities which can be drawn for an\\naccountability related study (Refer to Table 2 ).\\nThe four cases involve different levels and complexities of\\ntechnology usage, however, all of these cases share a common\\ndenominator: the necessity of education and monitoring from\\ngovernmental workers and volunteers to implement IoT HWSS\\nsystems. Since IoT HWSS systems are new in their philosophy,\\ndesign, processing, and administration, residents need to become\\nfamiliar with the system they are required to use. Residents are\\ncompelled to change their old habits and to form new habits in\\nusing the IoT HWSS system. Education and re-education can help\\nresidents to become familiar with the disposal processes of the new\\nFig. 2. Theoretical framework of IoT-enabled accountability.B. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y.

Meanwhile, monitoring\\ncan affect past behaviour, attitudes, normative beliefs, and\\nperceived control ( Webb et al., 2014 ). From an accountability the-\\nory perspective Vance et al. (2013 ,2015) , the identi ﬁability factor\\ncould encourage residents to better educate themselves about the\\nnew IoT system and related administration; the monitoring from\\nstakeholders can foster the expectation of evaluation and related\\nsocial presence to modify the residents ’disposal behaviour.\\nTherefore, education and monitoring are the necessary pre-\\nconditions for using IoT to establish accountability. Thus, the\\nfollowing proposition is proposed.\\nP1. Education and monitoring of residents are preconditions for\\nIoT-enabled accountability in household waste source separation\\n(HWSS).\\nThe success of HWSS depends greatly on its two responsible\\nstakeholders (residents who dispose waste, and collectors who\\ntransit the waste) at the front end. Since the traditional HWSS\\nsystem has its innate imperfections with pre-separation collector\\nbins, the system ’s capacity to succeed relies heavily on residents ’\\naccountability to put the waste into the right bins. Waste that is\\nincorrectly sorted may be the result of certain behaviour-related\\nattributes, such as carelessness, ignorance, lack of education, etc.\\nMoreover, a lack of effective onsite supervision and administrative\\nsystems to incentivise the desired behaviours also undermine at-\\ntempts to hold residents accountable, which leads to the poor levels\\nof performance reported. A case study of Suzhou, China indicatedthat 43% of the respondents thought they knew how to source-\\nseparate waste, but only 29% of them actually source-separated\\nwaste accurately ( Zhang and Wen, 2014b ).A system enabled by IoT technologies, however, can avoid such\\nﬂaws. With IoT-enabled HWSS, the resident needs to scan their\\nfamily ID-related barcode, or QR code, to open the correct bin in\\norder to dispose of the waste. In this way, the IoT system can easily\\nlink the residents ’identities with their waste disposal behaviours,\\nthus improving their identi ﬁability ( Williams et al., 1981 ) which,\\naccording to accountability theory ( Reicher and Levine, 1994 ),\\nshapes their behaviour. The IoT system can immediately detect if\\nthe waste has been disposed of accurately. Also, it simultaneously\\nrecords the disposal data such as disposal time, weight, category,\\naccuracy, as well as the corresponding reward or credit. All infor-\\nmation can be checked at the IoT HWSS online system by residents\\nusing devices such as smartphones and computers. Meanwhile, the\\ninternal motivation of residents to sort waste can be reinforced by a\\nreward system: the correct separation behaviour can gain credits as\\na bonus. Consequently, a reward system can train and educate\\nresidents to improve their awareness of expectations of evaluation\\n(Vance et al., 2015 ) and commitment ( Ferris et al., 1995 ). With the\\npassage of time, residents ’waste disposal behaviour can be\\nchanged, and their accountability can be strengthened. This leads to\\nthe following proposition.\\nP2. IoT systems can enable residents ’accountability in HWSS by\\nchanging their waste disposal behaviour.\\nThe other key entity in a HWSS system is the waste collection\\nstations ( “collectors ”). In the traditional HWSS system, the collectors\\nreceive the discarded waste at temporary depots and passively waitfor instructions or orders from the waste management company to\\nempty the bins and redirect the waste for appropriate treatment.\\nSince this traditional HWSS system was designed based on aTable 2\\nComparison of the selected cases.\\nCommonalities\\n$Implement local government Regulations on the Management of Domestic Wastes.\\n$Train residents to improve the awareness of the signi ﬁcance of garbage sorting and to cultivate the habit of waste sorting.\\n$Educate and re-educate the noncompliant users based on sample checking and inspection.\\n$All stakeholders work together to promote and enforce the project.\\n$Fine up to RMB200 for non-compliant residents.\\nDifferences\\nCase Waste classi ﬁcation Technology application Processing Reward\\nA\\n(2016d)hazardous, recyclable,\\nkitchen waste, otherPreliminary IoT system:\\nhand scan 2D barcodeon rubbish bagGovernment invests in infrastructure and provides free rubbish bags\\nwith 2D barcodes.

Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\\n7 stationary concept –that is, to collect waste in a pre-set geographic\\narea at a pre-set time –it lacks the ﬂexibility to deposit and clear the\\nwaste on time. Meanwhile, the collectors ’capacity remains\\nunderutilised or, at other times, insuf ﬁcient to meet the actual HWSS\\nrequirement in the clearance cycle. Since the amount of waste pro-\\nduced is signi ﬁcantly affected by many factors such as seasons,\\nweather, festivals, parties, holidays etc., the traditional system suf-\\nfers from low ef ﬁciency, poor performance, delayed operation, and/\\nor under-optimisation. To arti ﬁcially maintain the HWSS account-\\nability levels, the collectors ’bins in some communities are even\\nlocked when administrative supervision is not available.\\nThe IoT-enabled HWSS system, however, has been designed to\\nhave the dynamic ability to detect the real-time ﬁll level informa-\\ntion of rubbish bins and to notify the backend waste management\\ncompany to clear the bins in time. The backend operations can also\\nanalyse each collector ’s information and optimise the collection\\nand transport capacity in the whole area. With the real-time data\\nand monitoring mechanism provided by the IoT systems, the col-\\nlectors have no excuse of not achieving a high level of ﬂexibility and\\nefﬁciency in their waste collection operations. According to\\naccountability theory, such visibility in the operations enhances theexpectation of evaluation which, in turn, increases the collectors ’\\naccountability ( Boos et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the following propo-\\nsition is proposed:\\nP3. IoT systems can augment the collectors ’accountability in\\nHWSS by providing real-time visibility in their operations.\\nThe accountability of the residents and the accountability of the\\ncollectors interact with each other. Firstly, the residents ’account-\\nability is the prerequisite for the collectors to achieve their\\naccountability. If the residents do not feel accountable in correctly\\nsorting their waste, the collectors will not be able to realise their\\naccountability, regardless of how advanced and smart the systems\\nare. Indeed, there have been cases of residents whose lack of\\naccountability have directly impacted on the collectors ’account-\\nability. For example, many rubbish bins are burnt in China each year\\ndue to irresponsible disposals of cigarette butts.\\n1The collectors,\\nhowever, can also be regarded as a type of external source of\\naccountability for the residents ( Ferris et al., 1995 ). The account-\\nability of the collectors is the necessary condition for the residents\\nto achieve their accountability as it prompts residents to feel\\ncomfortable and con ﬁdent that they can control the waste disposal\\nresults ( Dose and Klimoski, 1995 ) given an increase in the expec-\\ntation of evaluation and social presence to satisfy their demands of\\naccountability ( Boos et al., 2013 ).\\nThe success of HWSS systems relies on the positive interactions\\nbetween residents and collectors and their respective account-\\nabilities. While traditional systems fail to achieve this interaction\\nbecause of their limitations in system design, IoT HWSS systems are\\nable to promote the interaction based on their inherent smart\\nsystems. When residents discard the waste into collectors ’bins, IoT\\nHWSS systems can detect the accuracy of the sorting from the\\nresidents. IoT HWSS systems can also measure the real-time situ-\\nation of the ﬁll rate of collectors ’bins; that is, when the “bins full ”\\nwarning is triggered and sent to the control centre, the centre will\\nassign the waste clearing team to empty the bins in a timely\\nmanner. Thus, residents can dispose of their waste without anylimitations related to time of disposal or bins ’capacity. In fact, the\\nless internal accountability is present in the residents, the greater\\nthe need to use external accountability, which can be effectively\\nenabled by IoT. Based on the above discussion, the following\\nproposition is proposed:P4. IoT systems can lead to positive interactions between the\\nresidents ’accountability and the collectors ’accountability.\\nNearly all the residents understand the importance and signif-\\nicance of HWSS to the environment, but this does not necessarily\\ntranslate to their correct separation and disposal of waste since\\ngood intentions may be forgotten ( Verplanken and Faes, 1999 ).\\nSince habits are forms of goal-directed automatic behaviour ( Aarts\\nand Dijksterhuis, 2000 ), the waste disposal habits of residents can\\nbe changed to achieve certain goals. Behaviour is the reaction of\\nstimulation from the external environment ( Weiner, 2010 ;Gneezy\\net al., 2011 ). If the result from the incentive is bene ﬁcial to oneself,\\nthe behaviour will be strengthened and repeated; if not, the\\nbehaviour will fail to be sustained. Although punishment can pre-\\nvent the enactment of undesirable behaviours, it cannot encourage\\ndesired behaviours and can instil resistance and boredom in the\\npunished ( Trevino, 1992 ). Rewards, however, can increase one ’s\\nintrinsic motivation and sense of self-determination, depending on\\nwhat is required of one to perform ( Eisenberger et al., 1999 ).\\nReward and punishment incentives, however, can only work\\nwhen there is support from all stakeholders, in this case, the gov-\\nernment, local council bodies, the community, and the residentialcommittee. This is because reward incentives need strong ﬁnancial\\nsupport from the government. For example, Shenzhen spends more\\nthan 60 million RMB in rewards each year.\\n2Equally, punishment\\nmechanisms can only work when the system is supervised and\\nimplemented by all the stakeholders involved.\\nReward and punishment incentives are less effective if they\\noperate in isolation –a successful system normally involves both\\ndimensions to simultaneously reward appropriate and punish\\ninappropriate behaviour ( Litzky et al., 2006 ). If the lens of\\naccountability theory is applied here, the moulding of desired be-\\nhaviours by residents can be explained in the following way: pos-\\nitive and negative incentives instil recognition in residents that\\ntheir disposal behaviour has consequences ( Williams et al., 1981 );\\nresidents ’expectations of having their disposal behaviour contin-\\nually evaluated are raised and normalised ( Lerner and Tetlock,\\n1999 ); and ﬁnally, the desired behaviour is reinforced through\\nthe perceived social presence of others ( Bond and Titus, 1983 ).\\nIndeed, the four cases (A-D) examined in this study proves that a\\ncombination of reward and punishment systems in IoT-enabled\\naccountability is more effective for motivating the public to\\nparticipate in source separation of household waste, and to form\\ncorrect behaviour, especially in the early stages. One testimony is as\\nfollows:\\n“The close combination of the rules and reward incentives is a\\nhighlight of our waste sorting work in Luohu District, and it is\\nalso a magic weapon for us to achieve the goal of waste sorting\\nwork. ”\\nWenzhi Lin (Deputy Director of Luohu District Urban Manage-\\nment Bureau, Case D).\\nOnce residents acquire the desired behaviour of correctly sort-\\ning waste, incentives may play a less signi ﬁcant role but can still\\nreinforce the desired behaviour. Therefore, the following proposi-\\ntion is advanced:\\nP5.IoT-enabled accountability can be most effective by applying\\nboth positive and negative incentives in the early stage imple-\\nmentation. Incentives, however, may be gradually phased out once\\nresidents have formed the habit of sorting rubbish.\\nThe accountability of the residents, however, may weaken if\\n1http://news.stcn.com/2019/1109/15486935.shtml (9 Nov 2019, Reporter: Yahua\\nSun).2http://news.stcn.com/2019/1109/15486935.shtml (9 Nov 2019, Reporter: Yahua\\nSun).B. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\\n8 they were to perceive a reduction in the system ’s capacity to\\nidentify users, or if the level of ongoing scrutiny that they have\\ncome to expect is somehow lessened over time ( Vance et al., 2013 ).\\nThe continuation of an accountability mechanism to shape and\\nsustain desired behaviours relies on the collaboration of all stake-\\nholders, including administrative supervision from the national\\ngovernment, city council, community, non-governmental organi-\\nsations, media organisations, and volunteers. In the four IoT-\\nenabled source separation projects examined in this paper, the\\ngovernment has played a central role, even though the projects are\\nestablished in different regions of China with different economic\\nand cultural backgrounds. When implementing IoT-enabled source\\nseparation in a residential community, only the local government\\nand its agencies have the authority, resources, and power to employ\\nits legal and administration system to enforce compliance. After an\\nIoT-enabled system is in place, there are on-going requirements to\\neducate residents, to monitor the participation of residents, and to\\ngive rewards and penalties to sustain the positive behavioural\\nchange in the public. The effort involved in managing and admin-\\nistering this programme may initially form and consolidate the\\nresidents ’accountability for an initial period but long-term\\naccountability requires an IoT system to make the HWSS work\\nsustainable and durable. This leads to the next proposition:\\nP6. To sustain a source separation programme over the long\\nterm, all the involved stakeholders must cooperate to play their\\nroles; IoT can facilitate such ef ﬁcacy by providing a platform to\\noperationalise the processes and to enable accountability effec-\\ntively and ef ﬁciently .\\n5. Discussion\\n5.1. Theoretical implications\\nThis study makes a theoretical contribution by establishing the\\nconcept of IoT-enabled accountability and its multiple dimensions.\\nFrom a systems perspective, a traceability service offers great\\nsupport to establish accountability. In the extant literature, most of\\nthe traceability applications are associated with non-human ob-\\njects. However, waste separation behaviour requires effort from\\nindividuals as proper household waste separation is essential for\\nthe achievement of a CE ( Stoeva and Alriksson, 2017 ). This is where\\nthe accountability principle becomes important as it deals with\\nhuman participants and often incorporates rewards and penalties\\nto reshape behaviour. Although the importance of people ’s\\nbehaviour is widely recognised ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ;Bernstad,\\n2014 ;Zhang and Wen, 2014b ), little research has investigated the\\nrole of IoT in bringing about a behavioural change in a source\\nseparation and CE context. This study advances the ﬁeld by moving\\nbeyond IoT-enabled traceability to IoT-enabled accountability.\\nIoT-enabled accountability is not only useful for waste man-\\nagement, but for any contexts where it would be bene ﬁcial to hold\\nhuman participants accountable. For example, IoT has been used to\\ntrack the location and speed of automobile vehicles. Applications\\ncan be developed for monitoring drivers, holding them accountable\\nfor irresponsible driving behaviours. On a manufacturing shop\\nﬂoor, IoT can be used to trace which workers perform certain pro-\\ncess steps. If defects and quality issues are a concern, accountability\\napplications can be developed for monitoring individual workers ’\\nquality performance. There is great potential for IoT technology\\nproviders to market IoT-enabled accountability applications, and\\nfuture research can explore innovative marketing mechanisms.\\nThe IoT-enabled source separation mechanism presented in thisresearch contributes to the rapidly-growing literature on smart\\nwaste management. Smart waste management is a relatively new\\nconcept ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) that offers a promising future but also\\nfaces many challenges ( Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017 ). An IoT-\\nenabled source separation mechanism could overcome a major\\nchallenge that is prevalent in many countries: speci ﬁcally, the\\nmajor obstacle to source separation posed by the culture and the\\npublic ’s behaviours. This is in line with the ﬁndings of Zhang et al.\\n(2019) that a lack of environmental education and a culture that is\\nnot oriented towards environmental protection is a key cause of\\nbarriers to smart waste management for a CE in China.\\n5.2. Practical implications\\nThe general propositions advanced from the case studies on IoT-\\nenabled accountability have extensive practical implications for\\nimplementing source separation of waste. Propositions 2 e4 sug-\\ngest that IoT systems can enable the accountability of waste gen-\\nerators (residents) and waste collectors, as well as supporting and\\nenabling positive interaction between their respective account-\\nabilities. The case studies show that it is technically feasible to trace\\nthe households which dispose of bagged rubbish in a residential\\ncommunity and to hold them accountable for their waste disposal\\nbehaviour. In the past, there lacked an ef ﬁcient means to identify\\nnoncompliant citizens with regard to correct source separation of\\nhousehold waste. However, the advancement of IoT technology\\ncould be a game-changer to enforce accountability in household\\nwaste source separation. Similarly, the IoT system enables the\\naccountability of waste collectors by providing real-time ﬁll rate\\ninformation to the waste management companies operating at the\\nbackend. The data generated by the IoT system would not only be\\nuseful in optimising the waste collection systems already in place,\\nthe data could also be used to design the new source separation\\nprojects as part of the nation-wide expansion of the proposed IoT-\\nenabled source separation program.\\nTheﬁfth proposition suggests that a combination of positive\\n(i.e., reward) and negative (i.e., punishment) incentives should be\\napplied to effectively and ef ﬁciently implement IoT-enabled source\\nseparation. Employing a “positive ”or a “negative ”reinforcement\\napproach alone cannot fully achieve the desired outcome. For\\nexample, Shanghai City in China recently started to enforce the very\\nstringent “Regulations on the Management of Household Waste ”from\\nthe July 1, 2019. An individual may be ﬁned 50 to 200 RMB, and an\\norganisation may be ﬁned up to 50,000 RMB for an infringement of\\nthe regulation. On the 1st July, 623 organisations were ﬁned in\\nShanghai ( Xinhaunet, 2019 ). The determination of the Shanghai\\ngovernment is commendable. However, the Shanghai government\\nfaces the key challenge of identifying non-compliant citizens. The\\nlong-term effectiveness of using punishment alone to enforce\\nsource separation also remains questionable. In light of the case\\nstudy ﬁndings, an IoT-enabled HWM system can help to accurately\\nand ef ﬁciently identify non-compliant citizens. The researchers\\nrecommend a combination of a “positive ”and “negative ”rein-\\nforcement approach in the early stages of implementing IoT-\\nenabled accountability, which is more likely to achieve a long\\nterm and sustainable change in the waste disposal behaviours of\\nthe public.\\nLastly, the sixth proposition suggests that all the involved\\nstakeholders must cooperate to play their roles in order to sustain\\nthe IoT-enabled source separation programme over the long term.\\nDespite having a long history of piloting various source separation\\nprojects and promoting CE nationwide, the Chinese enforcement ofB. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\\n9 environmental regulations has been considered weak ( Farooque\\net al., 2019a ;Zhang et al., 2019 ). With the introduction of IoT-\\nenabled accountability for source separation, the Chinese govern-\\nment and policymakers now have a reliable and robust evidence\\nbase on which they can con ﬁdently enforce legislation on\\ncompulsory source separation. It is now time for the Chinese gov-\\nernment to unify the waste separation and management standards,\\nto make more strategic investments in supporting infrastructure\\nand systems, and to develop speci ﬁc guidelines and educate the\\npublic about them. The resulting changes would have signi ﬁcant\\nimpact on China ’s sustainable development. Of course, there is a\\nneed for policy-makers to consider potential privacy issues in IoT-\\nenabled applications to secure data and channel accesses to pre-\\nvent the misuse of data ( Al-Turjman and Alturjman, 2018 ).\\nResidential communities and their estate management need to\\nplay an important role in enforcing source separation. With the\\nrapid progress of urbanisation in China, more and more people\\nhave moved to cities, where they live in residential communities.\\nTheir estate management bears the responsibility of managing the\\nhousehold waste that is discarded. They charge the residents a fee\\nfor their services. However, their traditional role is simply to co-ordinate rubbish collection by the waste management organisa-\\ntions and to keep the estate clean and tidy. The sorting of rubbish, if\\ndone at all, is undertaken by local waste management organisa-\\ntions. To implement an IoT-enabled source separation mechanism,\\nthe estate management needs to be equipped with IoT technology\\nand deploy manpower to monitor residents ’compliance in prac-\\ntising source separation. They also need to tailor training programs,\\nawards, and penalties for their estates to optimise the likelihood of\\nsuccessful implementation.\\nWaste management organisations need to shift their opera-\\ntional focus from land ﬁlls to value recovery from waste based on CE\\nphilosophy. Because about 60% of the household waste is food\\nwaste, there will be a great need to invest in food waste treatment\\nfacilities after implementing source separation. These facilities\\nneed to be capable of using food waste to generate biogas, organic\\nfertiliser, and protein feed. It is advisable for waste management\\norganisations to collaborate with a wide range of industry sectors to\\nmaximise value recovery. As an example, textile materials may be\\nrecycled to produce insulation products for the construction sector\\n(Nasir et al., 2017 ).\\n6. Conclusions\\nMany countries have faced serious challenges in managing ever-\\nincreasing household waste. The challenges are especially dif ﬁcult\\nfor developing countries due to rapid urbanisation and population\\ngrowth. Source separation in line with the philosophies of CP and\\nCE is a best practice for sustainable waste management. However, it\\nhas been little practised in China and many other developing\\ncountries due to complex issues with infrastructure, culture, envi-\\nronmental education, and the public ’s waste disposal habits. The\\nlack of accountability for these habits has been a major obstacle to\\nenforcing source separation by the households which dispose of\\nrubbish. This research addresses this challenge by investigating the\\nrole of IoT technologies in some of the most recent source separa-\\ntion projects, which have achieved considerable success.\\nIn establishing the concept of IoT-enabled accountability by\\nstudying multiple cases of innovative use of IoT technologies in very\\nrecent years in China, this paper offers a number of original con-\\ntributions. Earlier studies on source separation in China focused on\\nthe inhibiting factors which undermined many earlier pilot pro-\\njects; comparatively, this research reveals the reasons for success insome of the more recent projects. Earlier studies have also reported\\nIoT-enabled traceability applications, but the use of IoT to achieve\\naccountability in managing human behaviour is a new research\\ntopic, which warrants further studies. Furthermore, this paper ad-\\nvances six theoretical propositions which explain the multiple di-\\nmensions of IoT-enabled accountability.\\nThis study ’s results have signi ﬁcant practical implications. IoT-\\nenabled accountability in HWM contributes towards the develop-\\nment and adoption of CP technologies for improving environmental\\nsustainability. The results of this study are of global signi ﬁcance\\nbecause more and more countries are grappling with the challenge\\nof HWM. The underlying mechanism of IoT-enabled accountabilitythat is demonstrated by the case studies outlined in this paper offer\\nguidance to other countries that are facing similar challenges in\\nreshaping their citizens ’waste disposal behaviours.\\nThis paper has its limitations, of which one is its narrowed focus\\non accountability. Although lack of accountability is a key barrier to\\na successful source separation program, there are many other\\nbarriers that also need to be overcome, including issues in infra-\\nstructure and legislation. There is scope for future studies to\\ninvestigate such other relevant factors. Moreover, the context of thestudy is limited to China. Given that waste disposal behaviours are\\ninﬂuenced by culture, it is worthwhile to broaden the scope of the\\nresearch to different cultural contexts. Future studies should also\\ninvestigate ways of determining the ideal levels of reward and\\npunishment in order to reshape people ’s behaviour effectively. A\\nreward that is too small will be insuf ﬁcient to change people ’s\\nbehaviour, while overly generous rewards will lead to excessive\\ncosts in the long run. Quantitative research is required in the design\\nof the right reward/penalty scheme in order to elicit the desired\\nbehaviours.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nBill Wang: Methodology, Investigation, Writing eoriginal draft,\\nWriting ereview &editing.
