wmkousk yk  received june received in revised form july accepted july journal of hazardous materials introduction as one of the fastestgrowing global industries the booming healthcare industry is increasingly generating waste more than ever by providing a multitude of goods and services to control diseases and treat patients kenny and priyadarshini the generated healthcare waste hcw can highly affect environmental sustainability alharbi et al and community health dang et al furthermore with an increase in population index and growth in healthcare facilities thakur et al the global generation of hcw follows a growth rate of the hcw growth rate is even faster in china which is expected to reach a volume of million tons in li et al therefore hcw as a major environmental concern needs proper management and adopting suitable treatment strategies before final disposal to reduce its harmful impacts alam and mosharraf in this vein safe mechanisms to accurately segregate collect transport treat and dispose of hcw are pivotal for hcw management to ensure environmental protection and socioeconomic sustainability however properly implementing hcw management policies is facing many challenges such as lack of budget allocation by the hospital adminis tration unskilled workers handling the infectious waste and outdated technologies and methods used to dispose of hcw thakur et al for instance according to the assessment provided by the world health organization who in only of the sampled facilities from countries all around the world had proper systems to deal with the safe disposal of hcw who a a tremendous amount of research on different streams of hcw has been carried out over the last decade efforts within the existing liter ature have been mainly focused on but not limited to perceived risk and associated factors of hcw karki et al developing indicators for hcw management barbosa and mol ferronato et al hazardous medical waste komilis et al marinkovi c et al hcw incineration anastasiadou et al gidarakos et al sustainable environmental management of hcw alharbi et al hcw treatment technologies li et al and more recently hcw management challenges during the covid pandemic de aguiar hugo and lima although delivery of highquality care is the main priority for the healthcare industry waste minimization and preparation for reuse recycling and recovery programs based on the circular economy ce model should be considered to save both envi ronmental and financial resources voudrias nevertheless the literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of how a ce model can take in place to deal with hcw due to its infectious and hazardous na ture which poses a serious threat to the environment and human health on the other hand the outbreak of the covid pandemic has even made the disposing of hcw in a sustainable manner more complicated with highly infectious waste coming from patients and healthcare workers chauhan et al moreover due to the fragmented literature of hcw research an inclusive framework of hcw research themes and trends towards a ce transition and sustainable environment is still blurred calling for more investigation the main purpose of the current research is to provide a compre hensive image of the body of research on hcw management taking the ce and environmental sustainability into account to this end an analytical method combining bibliometric text mining and qualitative content analyses is employed to address three research questions rqs as follows rq how has the research landscape of hcw management developed rq what are the prominent research themes and areas of hcw rq what are the future research directions for hcw management towards a ce transition and sustainable environment the present research is the first broadbased study that employs a mixedmethod approach to render a stateoftheart review of hcw streams considering the ce and environmental sustainability to the best of the authors knowledge thus our review study broadly contributes to i understanding the field of hcw and its main research themes and subject areas towards a cleaner environment ii providing insightful guidelines and policies for practitioners and policymakers involved within the hcw supply chain to support environmental sustainability and transitioning towards a ce and iii identifying research gaps and offering future avenues for research on sustainable hcw management towards implementing a ce within the healthcare industry the remainder of the present paper is organized as follows section provides an overview of the current challenges of hcw streams to wards a ce transition and sustainable environment the research design and methodology are presented in section the main findings of the research are analyzed and discussed in section section shares the implications for research by offering future research directions followed by section that concludes the remarks and highlights the limitations of the study healthcare waste streams an overview the concept of hcw refers to any waste generated through the process of delivering healthcare services by healthcare facilities such as hospitals and clinics or in any other place by individuals or households a diversity of classifications exists for hcw mainly dividing the total stream into hazardous and nonhazardous fractions representing and of the total hcw respectively who as illustrated in fig s in supporting information nonhazardous fraction of hcw also known as general hcw is usually similar to municipal solid waste and includes paper plastic glass and food residues and containers generated mainly from the kitchen administrative and housekeeping activities within the healthcare facilities odur okwarteng et al in contrast with nonhazardous waste that does not result in any particular chemical or physical hazard the hazardous fraction of the hcw may result in a range of environmental and health risks domingo et al the hazardous hcw is classified into different categories according to the type source and risk factors related to its handling transport storage and final disposal who this waste stream includes sharps infectious waste obsolete or expired chemical products pharmaceuticals anatomical and patholog ical waste and radioactive waste un notably the disposal costs of hazardous wastes are ten times more than nonhazardous waste amariglio and depaoli therefore when reporting hcw gen eration rates adequately identifying the types and quantities of hcw produced is significantly crucial in proper and safe hcw management minoglou et al the who and international atomic energy agency have elaborated some policy documents and guidelines to support countries in imple menting better hcw management systems un furthermore many countries have signed and ratified such international conventions as basel convention on hazardous waste stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants and minamata convention on mercury in addition most of the developed countries adopted national legislative and administrative regulations to create a sustainable hcw manage ment system rizan et al fig summarizes the various levels of hcw governance with a focus on european union countries obviously in line with the global agreements and conventions set by the who and the international atomic energy agency european union has also laid several legislations directives strategies and action plans to improve waste management practices in europe part of which refers to hcw these directives and action plans include but are not limited to the waste framework directive european council european green deal european commission circular economy action plan european commission and directive on singleuse plastics eu furthermore at the regional level the european commission has adopted an economic and investment plan for the western balkans european commission a and the green agenda in the western balkans european commission b to support the green recovery of the countries of the region furthermore as a regional cooperation m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials program the environmental partnership program for accession was funded by the european union for a duration of three years to support the development in environmental governance in the western balkans and turkey eu these initiatives are followed by laws policies strategies action plans guidelines and steering committees at the national level in each country and are considered and followed by local communities including zerowaste ngos business sectors local scientific communities and other local stakeholders the status of hcw management systems in most western pacific region and southeast asia region countries is presented in the who reports who b despite some good practices outlined in these reports compliance with hcw management remains a significant challenge in many countries for instance some developing countries use open burning and incinerating in singlechamber incinerators as the major means of treating waste khan et al who furthermore in low to middleincome countries hcw is mixed with general domestic waste and disposed of in municipal waste facilities or dumped illegally as the main disposal route in these countries balde et al un consequently a proper approach for hcw management seems to be vital to be adopted in these countries and continued or improved in countries already considering them the ce has been introduced in the literature as a potential approach to reduce the negative environmental impacts of the hcw kane et al van straten et al the ce approach refers to a regenerative system in which through slowing closing and narrowing supply chain loops material input waste and emissions are minimized geissdoerfer et al accordingly the design framework for the ce is increas ingly used in industry to build up product circularity in terms of its multipleuse and recycling linder et al shevchenko et al and product sustainability in terms of minimizing its negative impact on the environment dyllick and rost some limited ce practices already exist within the hcw management system in various forms and maturity levels kane et al for instance the ce approach has been highlighted in the literature as a means of reducing hcw through reusing and recycling durable medical equipment ordway et al repairing and recycling hospital instruments and surgical stainless steel wastes van straten et al and replacing disposable products with reusable ones in medical and dental sectors antoniadou et al besides recovering value from disposables such as using medical nee dles in concrete production has also been stressed in the existing studies hamada and ismail however there is a lack of decent academic discussion regarding the application of ce principles and practices to increase resource efficiency in the healthcare industry and reduce the adverse environmental effects of both hazardous and nonhazardous hcw research design the present research followed a mixedmethod approach adopted from ranjbari et al b by employing an analytical method to map the scientific literature of hcw as illustrated in fig the rationales behind adopting this mixedmethod approach are unfolding the theoretical foundations and developments of hcw research by con ducting an analysis based on a massive database and taking advan tage of the ability of bibliometric and text mining analyses to identify established past evolutions and emerging topical areas ertz and leblancproulx within a huge amount of publications in the literature in a reasonable manner data collection and the process of analyzing the data are explained in the following sections data collection and preparation the web of science wos database as one of the most trusted publisherindependent global citation databases in academia was selected for collecting data herein a combination of different keywords directly addressing the scope of our study was extracted from literature and elaborated to design the following search string healthcare waste or medical waste or hospital waste or clinical waste or infec tious waste or sharps waste or pathological waste or pharma ceutical waste or biomedical waste search in the title of articles fig various levels of healthcare waste hcw governance with a focus on european union countries m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials and environment or sustainab or circular economy or circularity or closed loop or reduc or reus or recycl or hazard or manag search in the title abstract author keywords and keywords plus of articles only peerreviewed journal articles in the english language were considered ie conference proceedings edito rial reports book chapters etc were excluded with no time limit the search process was started in early march and stopped on june with a final sample consisting of articles table s in sup porting information summarizes the search protocol data cleaning was carried out in a reasonable manner on the final database to prepare the input for the keywords cooccurrence and text mining analyses ranjbari et al hence the singular and plural forms and the full and short abbreviation forms of author keywords were unified to avoid separately counting words with the same mean ings furthermore while different words with similar meanings such as social impact and social effect were unified within author keywords titles and abstracts general words without explicit meaning for the main focus of the current study such as article and review were removed from the author keywords to enhance the solidity of the ob tained results from the analyses the unification of writing styles was also done to merge the words and terms with a different spelling but the same meaning such as optimisation and optimization or modelling and modeling within the author keywords titles and abstracts of the articles data analysis as an effort to map the scientific literature of hcw the present research employed a mixed analytical method the applied research method was informed by incorporating a bibliometric analysis a text mining analysis and a qualitative content analysis to effectively extract information from a huge database of documents and draw an inclusive snapshot of hcw evolution characteristics practices challenges major research themes and trends and future perspectives the use of large datasets and keywordbased analyses in reviewing the academic literature has been growing over recent years bibliometric analysis is a systemic approach that quantitatively analyzes scientific literature zhang et al to provide the main research trends of a field of study and measure the research performance of journals re searchers institutions countries and research fields within academia li et al scholars have widely used this analysis as a powerful statistical tool to evaluate the scientific progress of various streams of waste management research such as food waste zhang et al and ewaste gao et al the bibliometric analysis herein was con ducted using the vosviewer software version van eck and waltman to map the hcw literature taking environmental sus tainability and the ce into account for the first time hence a compre hensive overview of the bibliometric status of hcw research including publications trends core journals and articles scientific coauthorship networks bibliographic coupling of documents and keywords cooccurrence analysis are presented herein moreover a text mining analysis was conducted on the titles and abstracts of the articles based on a term cooccurrence algorithm to unfold semantic conceptual struc tures and latent research themes which best characterize the relevant literature consistent with the research carried out by jia and jiang and ranjbari et al b a qualitative content analysis was also con ducted herein as a complementary layer to deepen the provided insights of the study accordingly due to the high number of articles within the dataset a bibliographic coupling analysis was conducted to cluster the articles with similar characteristics consequently the contents of the most recent articles over the last five years within each cluster of articles were scrutinized to investigate the theoretical orien tations in hcw management results and discussion the obtained results are presented and discussed in the following three subsections first the main findings of the bibliometric analysis are presented to reveal the general status of hcw research in section fig research framework adopted for mapping healthcare waste hcw management research from to m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials second the identified main hcw research themes are analyzed and discussed through text mining analysis in section and finally the insights provided by the content analysis are discussed in section findings of the bibliometric analysis the bibliometric parameters analyzed in this research including chronological distribution of publications analysis of core journals influential articles collaboration networks funding agencies analysis and keywords cooccurrence analysis are presented in the following subsections chronological distribution of publications searching in wos revealed that a total of articles had been published between and june that fits our search string and selection criteria the first research was conducted by mailhson and published in american journal of infection control as a critical review of the draft manual for infectious waste management from the environmental protection agency according to fig s in supporting information the overall growth of the published peerreviewed journal articles has increased since with some minor dints in the number of publications up to now analysis of core journals with respect to the source journals the articles of our sample have been published in journals indexed in wos among all the journals journals only published one article the top ten most productive journals in terms of the number of publications in the hcw research domain accounting for of the total published articles in our database out of are presented in the upper part of fig based on the results waste management research is the most pro ductive journal with articles and therefore plays a significant role in the hcw research domain the second and third most productive journals are waste management and fresenius environmental bulletin with and publications respectively the number of articles published by each of the mentioned top ten most productive journals during the recent five years is shown in fig s in supporting information waste management research the leading journal in terms of the publications number in the whole dataset has followed a growing trend within the recent year period and has managed to be the leading journal within this period conversely waste management the second most productive journal in our dataset has not shown a growth rate in terms of productivity during the past five years despite publishing five articles in be sides although journal of hazardous materials and journal of hospital infection are ranked th and th productive journals respectively they have had no record of publication from onwards in our database however a jump could be observed in terms of the number of publi cations by journal of cleaner production in and a considerable increase in the number of publications by fresenius environmental bul leting in and fig s in supporting information shows the publication trend of the journals with at least five articles in the period in our dataset reappearing waste management research waste management fresenius environmental bulleting environmental science and pollution research journal of material cycles and waste management and journal of cleaner production in fig s in supporting information shows that not only these journals are among the top ten most productive journals in this field of study but also they could retain their success in being among the most productive journals over the past five years however journal of the air waste management association journal of hazardous materials journal of hospital infection and americal journal of infection control have not appeared in fig s in supporting information sus tainability journal of environmental and public health and science of the total environment are the recent journals in the list of most productive journals in the past five years on the other hand the lower part of fig shows the top ten most influential journals regarding the number of citations they have gained until june based on the wos database with a total of citations waste management is the mostcited journal attracting the great atten tion of scholars in the hcw research area the following influential journals are waste management research journal of environmental management and journal of hazardous materials with and total citations respectively influential articles the number of citations to scientific articles could be used to fig top ten most productive journals in terms of the number of publications upper figure and top ten most influential journals regarding the number of citations lower figure m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials measure their influence on the related research area merig o et al table s in supporting information lists the top ten most influ ential articles within the hcw research domain in our dataset as shown in table s the most influential article with citations is an inclusive review paper conducted by windfeld and brooks that has pro vided an overview of medical waste management practices focusing on the common sources governing legislation and handling and disposal methods consistent with the previous article jang et al carried out the second highly cited article with citations to present an image of the current medical waste management practices considering gener ation composition segregation transportation and disposal of hcw in korea a system dynamics modeling research developed by chaerul et al is ranked the third among influential articles which has determined the interaction among factors in the hcw system high lighting the importance of proper waste segregation and infectious waste treatment prior to disposal in developing countries suitable toxicity evaluation of hcw tsakona et al and the issues regarding safe management of hazardous medical waste generated by hospitals marinkovi c et al are also included in the most influ ential articles moreover among the top ten most influential articles iranian authors with two case studies from iranian hospitals were ranked fourth askarian et al and tenth taghipour and mosa feri focusing on the characterization of hcw the journal waste management with six influential articles out of ten has a considerable contribution to the hcw research collaboration network analysis and funding agencies a total of countries contributed to the hcw research in our dataset among all these countries there were countries connected to others constructing a collaboration network as illustrated in fig s in supporting information the size of the circles and the thickness of the links between each pair of circles in the networks correspond to the number of articles of a country or institution and the strength of collaboration between the two entities respectively as shown in fig s in supporting information india with hcw related articles is placed in the topmost position of productive countries india is closely followed by china as the second most productive country with articles in this vein the usa iran england and turkey are the following productive countries with and hcwrelated research respectively moreover with respect to the number of collab orations with other countries china with international collabora tions mostly with pakistan the usa england and japan is ranked first england with and india with international links come next as the second and third most collaborative countries on the contrary taiwan with one and greece and brazil with three links have the lowest level of collaboration among the top ten countries in the list the results show that developing countries have had a considerable role in constructing the body of knowledge in the hcw research since six out of the top ten productive countries are from these countries including india china iran turkey brazil pakistan and taiwan nevertheless hcw management in developing countries has not received sufficient attention abd elsalam and many of these countries still suffer from inappropriate medical wastes disposal and treatment methods this issue may be due to the lack of required infrastructure technological advancements budget regulation and legislative enforcement however the gap between high scientific hcwrelated production in academia and low adaptation of suitable hcw strategies in practice to take a sound hcw management system in place could be an issue of debate for more investigation within the context of developing countries in terms of institutional contribution a total of institutions in our database have conducted research in the hcw context to illustrate the collaboration network among institutions the largest set of con nected institutions consisting of unique institutions were plotted as shown in fig s in supporting information chinese academy of sci ences with articles and zhejiang university with articles both from china and tehran university of medical sciences with articles from iran are the most productive institutions in hcw research moreover the top three actively collaborating organizations in the studied data base are tehran university of medical sciences chinese academy of sciences and university of northampton with and collabo ration links respectively iranian institutions appeared as the leading organizations in shaping the literature of hcwrelated research since four institutions out of the top ten contributing institutions are from iran tehran university of medical sciences is notably highlighted as the first institution in terms of the number of collaboration links with other institutions and the third institution in terms of the number of contributions only out of the articles in our database received funding supports however many of these research projects were funded by more than one source more specifically funding agencies were involved in supporting these research works fig s in supporting information presents the funding agencies supporting more than three research pieces in our database notably out of these funding agencies are from china which significantly highlights the important role of china in supporting research in the field of hcw management national natural science foundation of china with funding records is the leading funding agency in this field followed by the national basic research program of china with records as the second most sup porting program fundamental research funds for the central univer sities and the national key research and development program of china each with records of financial support are ranked third in terms of funding the research projects in this field of study european com mission which is the only nonchinese funding agency on the list of most supporting funding agencies comes next with records of funding remarkably although india has contributed more than china in terms of the number of publications in this field of research no indian program appeared on the list of top funding agencies besides while the usa iran england turkey brazil pakistan greece and taiwan are ranked the top ten productive countries there is no funding agency from these countries within the top contributing funding agencies keywords cooccurrence analysis the rationale behind conducting keywords cooccurrence analysis is that authors keywords can effectively convey the main idea and border of the scope of articles and their content comerio and strozzi the keywords cooccurrence analysis as a tool to identify research hotspots and focal nodes within the context of a particular subject gao et al has been widely used in recent bibliometric studies cooccurrence of keywords refers to the appearance of two keywords together in a single publication indicating that a relationship link exists between the two concepts baker et al after data cleaning and unifying keywords as explained in the methodology section the top most frequent author keywords used in the hcw research among the keywords in our database are presented in table s in supporting information on this basis medical waste waste management hcw biomedical waste and incineration are the top five most frequent keywords with and frequency of occurrence respectively the focus of these keywords is mainly on managing the hcw systems and proper disposaltreatment methods with an emphasis on the incineration of the hospital and clin ical wastes hospital waste hospital hcw management infectious waste heavy metal medical waste management environment haz ardous waste knowledge management incinerator segregation covid biomedical waste management and clinical waste were the next most frequent keywords in the hcw literature while total links denotes the number of keywords with which each keyword has a connection link total links strength shows the number of connection links each keyword has with other keywords therefore medical waste waste management and hcw have both the highest total links and total links strength scores in our database highlighting the significant role of these keywords within the body of knowledge in hcw research m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials the cooccurrence network of the keywords within the hcw research is visualized in fig due to the large number of keywords only keywords with a minimum occurrence of two have been plotted keywords out of to increase the visibility of the network map as shown in fig more occurrences of the keywords are reflected through larger circles and thicker links between them show a higher number of cooccurrence of a pair of keywords besides the colors of keywords circles moving from blue older to red more recent are based on the average publication year in which a keyword occurs the top most frequent pairs of keywords that most cooccurred in hcw research are listed in table s in supporting information the link between the medical waste and waste management nodes in the co occurrence network is the most prominent cooccurrence link with a strength score of indicating that hcw research has primarily centered on waste management practices moreover waste management has appeared six times among the nodes contributing to the top most frequent cooccurrence links this shows an overwhelming interest in academia in the issue of developing effective managerial frameworks for hcw towards a sustainable environment the second most cooccurred nodes are incineration and medical waste with cooccurrences in the database highlighting the importance of safe and proper disposal of medical waste to mitigate the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and public health notably mitigating the environmental and healthrelated consequences of the incineration process is a matter of the utmost importance for hcw management practitioners and policymakers adopting proper segregation and collection methods for biomedical waste particularly in dealing with hazardous waste has also appeared in the most salient nodes and links of the cooccurrence network of hcwrelated keywords text mining analysis identifying salient research themes having conducted a text mining analysis on the concatenation of the titles and abstracts of all articles a total of terms was detected according to the relatedness of the terms based on a co occurrence links algorithm the extracted terms were clustered a threshold of at least five occurrences of terms was applied for more visibility of the identified themes and their associated terms as a result four main hcw research themes were discovered including i hcw minimization sustainable management and policymaking ii hcw incineration and its associated environmental impacts iii hazardous hcw management practices and iv hcw handling and occupational fig

ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials safety and training fig visualizes the conceptual structure of hcw research and its four main research themes in the literature moreover a sample of the most relevant terms included in each research theme and also some recent exemplary references are provided in table one of the four identified dominant hcw research themes is modeling approaches towards hcw minimization sustainable man agement and policymaking the studies corresponding to this research theme have been mainly focused on the optimization issue for increasing the performance of hcw management systems such as routing opti mization for urban medical waste recycling networks gao et al and infectious waste disposal methods wichapa and khokhajaikiat on the other hand multicriteria decisionmaking methods have been widely employed within the first research theme for different purposes such as developing assessment models for hcw disposal geetha et al and choosing proper locations for infectious waste disposal as a critical issue in hazardous waste management to decrease the risk imposed on the environment wichapa and khokhajaikiat moreover optimization methods have been found useful in hcw management during the covid pandemic through developing cooperative models for the collection of infectious waste generated due to the pandemic valizadeh and mozafari sustainable multitrip locationrouting problems for medical waste management during covid tirkolaee et al and reverse logistics network design for medical waste management after covid kargar et al the second main research theme within the hcwrelated academic literature is incineration of hcw and its associated environmental im pacts incineration is the most frequently used treatment technology for hcw due to its capability to sterilize the pathological and anatomic waste reduce the volume and mass and recover energy zhao et al however the incineration process produces solid residues such as bottom and fly ash and offgas cleaning residues containing heavy metals and inorganic salts anastasiadou et al moreover waste incineration due to incomplete combustion may generate byproducts with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are highly carcino genic teratogenic mutagenic and genotoxic mahdi and gomes besides the improper disposal of bottom ash remaining from the in fectious hcw incineration has caused significant damages to the envi ronment and public health due to its high contamination effect on the soil and surface and underground waters gidarakos et al the articles within this research theme have been mainly focused on the influence of incinerated biomedical waste ash as a fine aggregate replacement on the properties of concrete kaur et al developing effective circulating systems for removing hazardous heavy metals in medical waste incineration fly ash ym li et al removal of alkalinity and metal toxicity from incinerated biomedical waste ash kaur et al the application of clean and safe technologies such as pyrolysis technology su et al and mi crowave disinfection in the hcw treatment mahdi and gomes and the quantities and characteristics of pollutants emitted during the incineration of medical waste ma et al zhang et al hazardous hcw as an increasing environmental concern has sha ped a major research theme in hcw research due to its adverse effects on environmental sustainability and human wellbeing the main focus of the research in the theme hazardous hcw management practices has been on the adequate proper and safe identification quantification segregation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous hcw which poses a significant risk to the environment and public health hence scholars have highlighted several issues in dealing with haz ardous hcw such as barriers to taking a proper hcw management in place including limited documentation regarding generation handling and disposal of waste and failure of planning and training in fig visualization of the main identified research themes of healthcare waste hcw research in the literature m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials particular in developing countries hassan et al mohamed et al the lack of wellestablished waste segregation and handling in many hospitals and medical center indicating the need for activation and enforcement of medical waste laws alkhatib et al the role of pharmaceutical waste management in collecting and disposing the medicinal waste of the population bungau et al and making the public aware of the significance of proper disposal of medications manojlovi c et al evaluation of hazardous medical waste generation from different categories of healthcare facilities komilis et al and developing integrated frameworks for medical waste management marinkovi c et al the last identified hcw research theme is hcw handling and occupational safety and training which refers to awareness and adequate knowledge about safe and proper handling and disposal of infectious and hazardous hcw the sufficient knowledge and practice of healthcare workers to sustainably deal with hcw and its potential risks are indispensable to perform any effective hcw management system akkajit et al the effectiveness of educational intervention programs based on the knowledge attitude and practices kap framework on hospital waste management abdo et al and assessing the impact of educational training on the behavioral intention for hcw management robat et al have mainly constructed the body of knowledge of this research theme moreover developing a kap model for implementing biomedical waste management practices in primary healthcare facilities gonibeedu et al and for reflecting the inadequacies in existing hcw management practices behnam et al has been widely considered the evolution of the selected main subject areas and research topics within the identified hcw research themes over the recent years is mapped in fig considering their average publication year average publication year calculated based on a binary counting of the terms refers to the average publication year of all the documents that contain a specific term in their titles or abstracts therefore more than one occurrence of a term in an article s title and abstract does not result in a higher weight for the article in the average calculation considering the growth of the number of articles on hcw as previously illustrated in fig s in supporting information since the number of articles has notably increased after the average publication year of the main terms in this field usually appears after as illustrated in the timeline in fig research topics such as life cycle assessment needle stick injury human health risk social responsibility objective function kap radio frequency identification technology and covid have been attracting attention very recently since their average publication year is between and based on the results covid and pandemic have been appeared as the most recent research topics with an average publication year of and respectively this result is due to the recentness of covid and the surge of research to respond to the urgent call for action against the pandemic ranjbari et al c a subject areas focusing on unused medicine biomedical waste management sharps waste personal protective equipment healthcare disposal pharmaceutical waste environmental hazards medical waste incinerator fly ash treatment technology in fectious hcw sanitary landfill and toxicity have been located in the average publication year period of moreover incineration polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon infectious agent landfilling waste management policy body fluid bottom ash pyrolysis liquid waste and

investigation as a result having checked the relevancy of the selected papers to the main focus of the present research a total of recent articles were chosen as the final sample for the content analysis cluster the application of modeling methods for effective hcw management systems modeling approaches have been widely used in developing hcw management systems to conceptualize design and optimize different hcw activities and practices such as designing collection and disposal networks transportation routes optimization selecting the optimal treatment technologies and locations due to the infectious nature of a portion of hcw effective planning is required in hospital waste trans portation liu et al developed a location optimization model for urban hcw storage sites based on the immune algorithm to increase the efficiency of hcw transport from hospitals to disposal stations homayouni and pishvaee presented a multiobjective robust optimization model to design a collection and disposal network of hazardous hcw to minimize the transportation and operations risks and costs gao et al extended an integrated optimization model of urban hcw recycling network considering differentiated waste collec tion strategies with time windows establishing proper hcw disposal centers is crucial to reduce the environmental and public risk of hcw pollution yao et al proposed a softpath solution to minimize risks and mitigate the associated costs by optimizing the hcw disposal centers locationallocation problem torkayesh et al proposed a decisionmaking model for hcw landfill location selection with a sus tainable development perspective to identify the most convenient lo cations for landfilling a biobjective mixedinteger linear programming model was provided by nikzamir et al to design a logistic network of infectious and noninfectious wastes to minimize the network costs and the risk of exposure to contamination besides a multiobjective mixedinteger program for reverse logistics network design for effective management of hcw in epidemic outbreaks such as covid was proposed by yu et al to identify the best locations for temporary facilities selection of the optimal treatment technology for medical waste is a complex multicriteria decisionmaking problem due to the conflicting and intertwined quantitative and qualitative evaluative criteria hin duja and pandey hence an integrated decision support frame work was developed by hinduja and pandey to assess hcw treatment alternatives and prioritize and select the optimal treatment technology among incineration autoclaving microwave disinfection chemical disinfection reverse polymerization and pyrolysis in line with the research conducted by hinduja and pandey nar ayanamoorthy et al developed a multiobjective optimization model and showed that autoclaving is the best alternative for biomedical waste disposal treatment methods on the other hand li et al proposed a multicriteria decisionmaking method for evaluating hcw treatment technologies in the emerging economies and indicated that steam sterilization is the best hcw treatment technology among mi crowave incineration and landfilling cluster hcw management practices mismanagement of hcw owing to its potential hazard can signifi cantly pose environmental and occupational health risks to the global community however implementing

a survey in bangladesh hasan and rahman stated that of hospital workers do not receive any form of training to deal with hazardous waste and of them do not use any safety equipment or clothing besides a suitable approach to select an effective hcw treatment technology particularly for treating hazardous waste is still challenging for municipal authorities hasan and rahman gunawardana in an empirical analysis of healthcare service providers in sri lanka outlined an urgent need for training the top managers involved in the healthcare industry to create a positive attitude towards adopting new hcw treatment technologies and trends proper actions regarding hcw identification prediction segrega tion collection transportation and disposal in hospitals could control putting the workers safety at risk the importance of timely and pre cisely determining the quantity and quality of infectious hcw was highlighted by yousefi and avak rostami in effective hcw management systems moreover sustainable hcw management could be implemented only if an adequate waste generation prediction is made otherwise investment in this sector would be inefficient etin kaya et al in this context santos et al in a study to evaluate the hcw management in a brazilian context showed that more than of the generated hcw is general waste followed by infec tious sharps and chemicals wastes with the shares of and respectively mmereki et al showed that current hcw collection and storage facilities in botswana in africa do not operate efficiently and more focus should be on the segregation of infectious and noninfectious from general waste pollution prevention and re covery of valuable materials from healthcare facilities in another study conducted in representative clinics in indonesia wilujeng denoted that segregation collection and storage of the waste generated by clinics comprising of sharps infectious and general waste did not comply with the government regulatory standard eslami et al reported that of private hospitals and of government hospitals in iran lack any treatment devices and hazardous hcw is disposed of without any treatment showing poor hazardous treatment services khan et al highlighted the need for replacing outdated incineration plants with autoclaving steam sterilization and new practices of pyrolysis to avoid the emission of toxic gases in the asian developing countries which lack proper waste segregation collection storage transportation and disposal developing hcw in dicators to continuously monitor handle and manage hcw generation and its associated risks significantly improves hcw risk management barbosa and mol and hcw operation systems from identifica tion at the beginning to the disposal at the end cluster hcw treatment technologies and methods implementing effective hcw management practices to a large extent is determined by the treatment technology applied the application of an hcw technology which is simultaneously inexpensive liu et al and environmentally friendly ethica et al has been a subject of research interest over recent years according to the study conducted by jang et al hcw treatment technologies such as steam sterilization chemical disinfection microwave sanitation recy cling reverse polymerization dry heat disinfection autoclaving and incineration are considered as alternatives some studies highlight that due to the advantages of the incineration method for instance destruction of bacteria or viruses reduction of the waste volume and the potential for energy reuse many countries incinerate hcw tre booniti zhang et al moreover incineration is used to dispose of of the general hcw worldwide li et al zhang et al however the medical waste incinerator is considered a key source of hypertoxic pcdds and pcddfs emission and heavy metals according to stockholm convention therefore various technologies to remove or reduce these chemicals from bottom ash and fly ash are table selected most recent

et al singh et al woromogo et al mannocci et al m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials actively being developed to avoid secondary pollution the academic discussion is still ongoing with a focus on the emission characteristics of pcddfs and heavy metals resulting from the incineration ma et al zhang et al technologies for the reduction of the emission li et al qin et al and techniques to remove ym li et al or reduce the concentration of heavy metals from the medical waste fly ash ababneh et al shen et al or detoxify the fly ash liu et al in particular various treatment techniques for medical waste fly ash and their merits demerits applicability and limitations have been reviewed by liu et al an effective circulating system based on using edta disodium naedta was developed by li et al to remove cu pb zn cd and ni from medical waste fly ash shen et al proposed a technology to reduce dioxin formation during the incineration process based on using activated carbon which adsorbs dioxin and pelletizes it with adhesive material the treatment technology for medical waste incinerator fly ash which is considered hazardous to simultaneously detoxify both pcddfs and heavy metals through a successive flotation process was proposed by liu et al exploring the possibilities of medical waste fly ash recycling in mortar mixtures ababneh et al proposed using ethylene diaminetetra acetic acid disodium as a chelating agent allowing the reduction of the heavy metals concentration in medical waste fly ash in addition the study by anastasiadou et al demonstrated the feasibility of using fly and bottom ash in cement matrices to dispose of them safely in nonhazardous landfills or even to reuse these materials in the con struction industry another line of studies in academia considered hos pital wastewater and focused on the pollution of the groundwater near the biomedical waste treatment facilities samad et al migration of heavy metals from the biomedical waste autoclave to groundwater pant and hospital wastewater treatment using hydrolytic bac teria ethica et al even though recycling is an effective way to reduce the amount of hcw there is a lack of academic debate on the segregation techniques to reduce regulated medical waste at the source of such waste generation for example shinn et al showed that almost of all regu lated medical waste in korean hospitals comes from operating rooms according to their research while regulated medical waste notably consists of disposable packaging and wrapping materials for sterilization of surgical instruments the nonregulated medical waste includes recyclable materials such as plastics cardboards papers and different wrapping materials therefore the reduction in hcw generation could be achieved through the systematic segregation of hospital operating room wastes furthermore researching the hospital recycling issue mcgain et al argued that due to the lack of appropriate hospitalrelated recycling companies there is a necessity to encourage local manufacturers to reduce the amount of packaging used or to change the materials used which is still challenging cluster pharmaceutical waste from the waste management perspective two main streams of pharmaceutical waste are pharmaceutical wastes produced by households and in primary care treatment facilities including unused unwanted or expired drugs or medicines with vials and syringes and pharmaceutical wastes including at least one type of medical waste generated by pharmacies clinics hospitals and other healthcare and research facilities vallini and townend voudrias et al environmental contamination in the wake of active ingredients in pharmaceutical waste has become an emerging global concern chung and brooks for the environment and ecosystem which calls for more preventive actions and inclusive environmental stewardship of pharmaceuticals chung and brooks in an instreet survey in hong kong with respondents showed that of the population has unneeded medicines at home they also came to know that each household is storing on average g of unnecessary medicines of which the main type is medicines for cold based on their research more than of people dispose of unwanted or expired medicines in garbage cans along with the usual solid waste this highlights the role of households as a primary source of pharmaceutical pollutants to affect environmental sustainability adversely in another study to assesses the public perception of environmental effects caused by pharmaceutical waste in malaysia ariffin and zakili denoted that while of the respondents believe that their household pharmaceutical waste should be separated from other households solid waste only return their unused or expired medicines through the medicine returnback pro grams they highlighted an urgent need to develop effective returnback programs and channels for pharmaceutical waste particularly house hold medicine waste as a safer and environmentally sustainable disposal method to avoid posing hazardous risks to the environment and human health to tackle the pharmaceuticals in the environment problem mitkidis and mitkidis proposed to redesign current pharmaceutical takeback schemes and regulations to facilitate the interdisciplinary research collaborations between the fields of psychol ogy law public health and medical science to mitigate the problem moreover the need for developing an integrated treatment system for pharmaceutical waste sarkar et al and designing green effi cient and scalable extraction platforms and separation methods to valorize the active pharmaceutical ingredients from pharmaceutical waste mari c et al have been highlighted as the current chal lenges faced towards sustainable pharmaceutical resource management cluster knowledge attitude and practice of hcw management healthcare facilities such as hospitals clinics and nursing homes as the main producers of hcw are responsible for segregation collection insite transportation hcw pretreatment and hcw storage before such waste is collected by common hcw treatment facility operators gonibeedu et al therefore training and monitoring programs on hazards linked to hcw to increase awareness and responsibility among healthcare personnel are crucial to implementing effective hcw practices and management gonibeedu et al in a study to evaluate the knowledge attitude practice and gaps in implementing the hcw practices in the primary healthcare facilities in india showed that the efficiency scores of knowledge attitude and practice are good average and average respectively they high lighted the need for retraining all the personnel involved in the healthcare facility and periodically supportive supervision by health authorities to foster the implementation requirements parida et al observed that while only of healthcare workers in an indian context know that the most important step in hcw management is waste segregation only of them correctly answer the questions regarding the associated hazards of hcw moreover they found that laboratory waste handling is the least understood area of hcw management in another survey to assess the awareness of biomedical waste manage ment among dental students in nepal singh et al denoted that although the majority of the studied dental students have positive attitudes towards safe management of biomedical waste more than half of them have no idea of the guidelines laid down by the government including mandatory attendance in regular training workshops in the annual performance evaluation of all staff to increase compliance in line with periodic monitoring is the only way forward to reinforce knowledge attitudes and practices towards achieving sus tainable hcw management parida et al woromogo et al showed that a good level of knowledge among medical staff more likely leads to favorable attitudes towards hcw management besides a good level of both knowledge and attitudes positively affects the asso ciated hcw management practices indicating the important role of knowledge and attitudes in successfully adopting hcw management m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials policies and strategies however mannocci et al outlined the need for crosssectional studies to develop a standardized and method ologically validated tool to assess the knowledge attitude and practices of healthcare professionals to better manage hcw activities due to the differences in national legislation the healthcare industry settings ed ucation systems and cultural contexts assessing the level of knowledge attitudes and practices regarding hcw management seems challenging and needs specific customizations on predesigned questionnaires future research directions for hcw management towards a ce transition in general despite its potential to contribute to the ce transition the healthcare industry has been overlooked in the ce discourse compared to other sectors such as food plastic and manufacturing industries this may be due to the singleuse mindset of the healthcare industry setting in the wake of infectious toxic and hazardous nature of different hcw streams which makes implementing ce strategies such as reuse recycle and recover more challenging than ever in particular based on the results provided in previous sections potential research avenues for further research in the future regarding hcw management towards implementing a ce are presented in this section and summarized in fig overall three lines of research were identified to support the ce transition in the healthcare industry and hcw management context as follows effective pharmaceutical waste management from the ce perspective the pharmaceutical industry has been mainly focusing on reducing waste generation within the manufacturing processes over the recent years in general the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector through the use of current sustainability models eg environmental quotient environmental factor life cycle assessment process mass intensity and green chemistry model has reduced waste generation ang et al however existing pharmaceutical waste research lacks a compre hensive study of the role of consumers and their consumption pat terns towards implementing a ce in the pharmaceutical industry as a result developing a consumercentric framework in line with ce principles highly deserves to be considered by researchers in future research to see how consumers could effectively contribute to pharmaceutical waste reduction hence some potential directions would be designing optimal returnback channels for expired medicines and developing medicine sharing platforms under the required sanitary monitoring conditions for sharing unneeded or unwanted medicines among local communities to maximize the idle capacity ranjbari et al prevent the households pharma ceutical waste generation and increase the pharmaceutical resource efficiency developing a ce transition framework for hcw management activities all together a few pieces of research regarding the adoption of a ce perspective for healthcare organizations have been conducted recently for instance voudrias highlighted some steps that should be taken by healthcare facilities including designing reusable items instead of singleuse materials adequately measuring waste pro duction and taking waste mitigation actions moreover chauhan et al proposed a smart hcw disposal system enabled by in dustry that takes ce perspectives into account nevertheless putting an integrated ce model in place to deal with hcw as a whole is still lacking in the literature a potential research direction for the future is designing developing and implementing a comprehensive ce transition model for hcw management as a whole considering all activities involved within the waste hierarchy in particular the following five areas are recommended to be addressed in the future of the circular healthcare industry setting a clear agenda and drafting a ceoriented healthcare industry action plan educating and more importantly activating healthcare facilities to change their routine from singleuse mindset to embracing the ce transition optimizing healthcare asset sharing platforms among healthcare facilities such as hospitals clinics and medical centers devel oping ce indicators for the healthcare industry to adequately mea sure and monitor the progress of hcw management strategies and actions towards establishing a circular healthcare industry and encouraging crosssectional partnership among medical de partments healthcare manufacturers reprocessing companies and suppliers to i close slow or narrow healthcare supply chain loops and ii develop reusing and reprocessing infrastructures towards achieving a ce innovative solutions for creating circularity within the health care industry business model the complex issue of reusing and reprocessing healthcare materials products and instruments has been discussed in the waste management debate over recent years on the one hand disposable and singleuse materials and products are widely used to control infection in the healthcare industry increasing hcw generation replacing singleuse products with reusable ones can significantly reduce the rate of hcw produced by healthcare facilities particularly hospitals for instance kwakye et al denoted that a bed hospital is estimated to reduce waste kgyear and save usyear only by using reusable sharp containers instead of disposable ones on the other hand although reprocessing of singleuse products by healthcare facilities which refers to reusing singleuse products after repairing cleaning and sterilizing could save costs and reduce waste it faces many challenges such as ethical legal and patient safety issues voudrias the ce discourse in the healthcare industry is still in its infancy stage and highly needs more innovative approaches towards creating circularity and closing the loops in delivering highquality healthcare services with fewer materials used and less hcw produced therefore investigating innovative solutions for creating circularity within the business model and supply chain of the healthcare industry through policy incentives and technological advancements is recommended as another potential future research avenue in this vein three identified research areas to support the ce transition in the healthcare industry are technolog ical and methodological advancements for safely recovering as much value as possible from hcw hence various solutions should be devel oped and investigated at different scales to ensure maximal energy re covery from hcw streams these solutions should be thoroughly scrutinized using advanced sustainability assessment tools which have been effectively employed in various sectors of the waste management and valorization domain such as life cycle assessment khoshnevisan et al rajaeifar et al exergy analysis barati et al tabatabaei et al exergoeconomic analysis aghbashlo et al b soltanian et al and exergoenvironmental analysis aghbashlo et al a optimizing tradeoffs between singleuse and reusable healthcare materials products and instruments to replace as much singleuse as possible with reusable ones to close the supply chain loops and maximize the healthcare resource efficiency and policy incentives to encourage financing in the hcw management sector and enforcing authorities regulations to foster the ce transition in particular within the context of developing countries concluding remarks the present research as an attempt to map the past evolution and the current status of hcw research and discover its main research themes and trends was conducted by following a mixedmethod approach on articles in wos from to having scrutinized the m ranjbari et al journal of hazardous materials literature our study particularly contributes to the existing body of knowledge of the hcw management domain by i providing a comprehensive overview of hcw management research and its associ ated research themes and trends and ii identifying research gaps and proposing future avenues for research on sustainable hcw management towards implementing a ce within the healthcare industry based on the results four main research themes of hcw manage ment were identified including hcw minimization sustainable management and policymaking hcw incineration and its associ ated environmental impacts hazardous hcw management practices and hcw handling and occupational safety and training despite its great potential to contribute to the ce transition the findings showed that the healthcare industry has been overlooked in the ce discourse compared to other industries such as food plastic and manufacturing this may be due to the singleuse mindset of the healthcare industry settings in the wake of infectious toxic and hazardous nature of different hcw streams which makes the implementation of ce strate gies such as reuse recycle and recover more challenging than ever three research avenues were provided for further research towards putting a ce in place for the healthcare industry and hcw management including i effective pharmaceutical waste management through reduction of household pharmaceutical waste ii developing a ce transition model for the healthcare industry and its associated hcw management practices and activities as a whole and iii providing innovative solutions for creating circularity within the business model and also supply chain of the healthcare industry through policy in centives and technological advancements the theoreticalpractical implications of this inclusive review for researchers practitioners and policymakers involved in the healthcare industry and hcw management practices are outlined herein re searchers and scholars are served by i rendering a comprehensive image of hcw management developments over time ii identifying the most influential articles and journals that mainly have directed this field of study iii mapping collaboration networks of contributing countries institutions and funding agencies iv providing hotspots in the hcw management through employing keywordbased analyses v unfolding prominent research themes and subject areas which have shaped the main body of knowledge in hcw management and vi drafting a research agenda for the healthcare industry and accordingly hcw management in line with ce principles for practitioners policymakers and official authorities the findings of the present study can be used as a guideline to i increase the understanding of different hcw manage ment practices from waste identification and prediction to waste disposal and incineration and their impacts on the environment human health and workers safety ii support implementing effective hcw management practices according to ce principles towards a cleaner and sustainable environment the present study is no exception to the limitations which can be addressed for further developments firstly the nonenglish research was excluded from the database used herein although they may add more value to the obtained results and provided insights secondly the wos database was the only database of the current study leading to missing some relevant research in this area and finally we employed bibliographic coupling as the data clustering technique to group the articles for conducting content analysis in this research applying other methods and algorithms to cluster articles might help improve the clustering results and accordingly content analysis for future studies credit authorship contribution
