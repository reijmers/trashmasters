d municipalities on the SNIS database. Municipal gross
domestic product (GDP) ( IBGE, 2016 ) and the human development
index (HDI) ( UNDP, 2010 ) were used as independent variables for
projecting selective collection masses.
The SNIS (2017a) report presented a proportional rate of MSW
selectively collected by public agencies, private agencies, and for-
mal waste picker organizations. Thus, we determined transfer coef-
ﬁcients for each agency who undertook the selective collection by
extracting their respective rate information from the SNIS (2017a)
report.
After calculating the masses of MSW collections, we estimated
the proportion of plastic packaging in the MSW. For the proportion
of plastic from selective collection, the SNIS (2019a) information
was taken from 2017 as published in its report. For the proportion
of plastic from mixed collection, information was taken from IPEA
(2012) study, which is the only national research on Brazilian MSW
composition. The proportion of plastic waste that is packaging in
selective and mixed collections was expressed by Geyer et al.’s
(2017) worldwide estimate, because there are no Brazilian studies
about the levels of PPW in MSW.
Finally, the mass of PPW which was recycled was obtained from
the Technical Report of the Brazilian Sectoral Agreement for the
implementation of reverse logistics of general packaging ( SINIR,
2017 ).
Data on manufacturing new products by recycling PPW was
extracted from the Brazilian PET Industry Association ( ABIPET,
2016 ) report, which referred to PET products. The report presents
the breakdown of ﬁnal uses of recycled PET in Brazil in 2016. The
rates of PPW recycled for new plastic packaging and for non-
packaging applications were extracted from this report and used
as a transfer coefﬁcient in the MFA system.
2.3. Data quality
Data availability to quantify material ﬂows is often limited,
owing to data scarcity or missing data ( Laner et al., 2016 ). Data
used for MFA are interdisciplinary, have heterogeneous sources,
and may vary on formats and qualities ( Schwab et al., 2017 ). There-
fore, assessing the reliability of the ﬂows provides the quantiﬁca-
tion of the data limitations for system understanding.
The quality of the data sources was assessed using the uncer-
tainty characterization method developed by Laner et al. (2016) .
The approach was developed to include data quality indicators
within the pedigree matrix presented by Weidema and Wesn æs
(1996) , combined with the quantiﬁcation of uncertainty based on
data source classiﬁcation as proposed by Hedbrant and Sörme
(2001) . Firstly, data quality of all MFA input ﬂows was evaluated
by data quality indicator scores ( Sieber et al., 2020 ), presented in
Support Information S8. These indicators encompass the geograph-
ical and temporal representativeness, the investigated material,
and the completeness and reliability of the source ( Sieber et al.,
2020 ). The assigned scores for each information source are pre-
sented in Support Information S10.
These various data quality indicators were translated into
uncertainty by coefﬁcients of variation (CVs) ( Muchangos et al.,
2019 ). Uncertainty was assumed to increase exponentially with
poor data quality ( Laner et al., 2016 ). Data uncertainty was
assumed to be normally distributed, because of its mathematical
convenience ( Tran et al., 2018 ). These assumptions have also been
made by Muchangos et al. (2019), Eygen et al. (2018), Tran et al.
(2018), Makarichi et al. (2018) , and Warrings and Fellner (2018)
while executing Laner et al. (2016) approach. The CVs are the stan-
dard deviation divided by the mean ( Eygen et al., 2017 ). The
detailed procedure for the CV calculation is shown in the Support
Information S9.2.4. MFa
The input ﬂows that we used to perform the MFA are summa-
rized in Support Information S7. We used the previously calculated
CVs as input uncertainty values for the input ﬂows (Support Infor-
mation S11).
MFA is based on the law of conservation of matter within the
system and all its processes ( Brunner and Rechberger, 2004 ). The
ﬂows are calculated by using a material balance to compare the
mass of all ﬂows entering, leaving, and stocked at a process
(Eygen et al 2017 ). Therefore, the mass of all ﬂows entering a pro-
cess must equal the mass of ﬂows leaving this process plus the
stock change ( Allesch et al., 2017 ). Support Information S12 pre-
sents the mass balance equations. Using this procedure, unknown
ﬂows can be calculated by balancing the system ( Eygen et al.,
2017 ). Therefore, the previously unknown ﬂows of the system —
the informal collection of PPW, the PPW tailing in sorting units,
and the amount of non-monitored PPW— were estimated by the
MFA (Table S2.3).
We used STAN 2.6 software, developed by Tu Wien, to perform
the MFA and for data visualization through a Sankey diagram, in
which the thickness of the ﬂows was proportional to their value
(Cencic and Rechberger, 2008 ). We used STAN to reconcile data
and to perform error propagation. STAN is a free software that
has been used widely in the scientiﬁc literature for several MFAs,
such as the studies performed by Boh and Clark (2020), Tazi
et al. (2019) and Brouwer et al. (2018) .
Input redundant information are used to reconcile the MFA
input data ( Cencic and Rechberger, 2008 ). The method of least
squares is used for data reconciliation, in which uncertainties are
used as weighing factors ( Cencic, 2016 ). By data reconciliation,
we calculated the values for the MFA output ﬂows – with previous
information. Subsequentially, the reconciled values were used to
calculate previously unknown ﬂows ( Cencic and Rechberger,
2008 ) by balancing the system.
STAN presents a data reconciliation quality (DRQ) indicator
(Brouwer et al., 2018 ), which expresses the difference between 1
and the mean value of measurement adjustments per maximum
allowed adjustment. DQR ranges from 0 to 1 ( Cencic, 2016 ), and
DQR close to 1 indicates that the reconciled data matched the orig-
inal data well ( Brouwer et al., 2018 ).
3. Results and discussion
Firstly, we present the results for the projections of the selec-
tive and mixed collections of MSW. Subsequently, we show the
input data quality uncertainty of the MFA input ﬂows. Finally,
we display the PPW modeled system and the values of the out-
puts ﬂows.
3.1. MSW collections projections
There were 1,771 municipalities served by a selective collec-
tion service in Brazil, accounting for 32% of all Brazilian munici-
palities. The SNIS (2019b) database lacked information on
selective collection mass for 536 of these municipalities, which
had their mass estimated by linear regression. The multiple linear
regression equation, established to predict the mass of selectively
collected MSW in Brazil in 2017, is shown in Formula (3),i n
which SCM is the selective collection mass (t). This regression
model explains 36% of the original variability (Table S5.1). The
regression residuals follow the normal distribution ( Figure S5.1
and Figure S5.2 ).
