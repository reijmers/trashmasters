VolJ Mater Cycles Waste Manag DOI s SPECIAL FEATURE REVIEW A review of waste prevention through R under the concept of circular economy in China Lili Liu Yangyang Liang Qingbin Song Jinhui Li Received May Accepted January Published online April Springer Japan Introduction The present period can be seen as the most active time regarding material production and consumption in the history of humans although there are great differences in these activities depending on the part of the world Increasing population booming economy rapid urbanization and the rising living standards have greatly accelerated the depletion of natural resources and waste generation in the world especially in developing countries How to deal with the resource scarcity and waste issues has become one of the global issues Through promoting the adoption of closingtheloop production patterns within an economic system circular economy aims to increase the efficiency of resource use with the special focus on urban and industrial waste to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy environment and society The circular economy has most often been considered as an approach for more appropriate waste management The circular economy is rapidly landing on the world of waste and resources management and becoming a dominant concept to establish the sustainable society and world So far various literature case studies reviews scientific reports etc on circular economy studies have been published worldwide A large number of these studies concern the implementation of circular economy in China because huge environmental human health and social problems posed by its rapid and continuous economic development pattern and China strongly need and commit circular economy The traditional way of natural resources utilization in China was to increase the product output by consuming more materials and energy and huge amounts of waste generated during production but it was an unsustainable development pattern With the enormous consumption of Abstract The large waste generation has become one of the worldwide environmental problems Circular economy has been seen as a way to tackle its urgent problems of environmental degradation and source scarcity In recent years under the concepts of circular economy waste prevention through Reduce Reuse and Recycle R rules have attracted a broad concern in China China has made some great achievements on waste management and at the same time is facing many challenges It is very necessary to share the management experiences and practices with the scholars and managers in other countries This review covered the current situation and progress of circular economy development from the perspective of the legal regime and project practices and the recycling practices of typical waste The typical household wastes including municipal solid wastes MSW ewaste and end of life vehicles ELV were studied as the typical cases Based on an examination of the statistical results we also identified the potential problems and challenges for waste prevention through R in China Finally we provided some effective measures to further improve the waste management and recycling in China Keywords Solid waste Circular economy R rules Experiences and challenges China Waste Prevention Researches Jinhui Li jinhuitsinghuaeducn Key Laboratory for Solid

Technology Macau Peoples Republic of China J Mater Cycles Waste Manag resources and energy a high amount of solid waste was generated According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection in China the total solid generation was about million tons in with an average annual increasing of Meanwhile due to the wide varieties and complex composition of solid waste it has brought the significant threats to the environment and human health Generally speaking the waste has become one of the main influence factors on the environmental protection Apart from the pollution property waste also includes many valuable materials and resource eg ewaste contains a considerable quantity of copper iron aluminum gold silver etc and their contents are much higher than that of natural mineral resources With the large exploitation and consumption of natural resource the available resources in China are becoming less and less As the largest energy production and consumption country in the world primary energy output summed to about billion tons of standard coal equivalent in and the total consumption was higher up to billion tons of standard coal equivalent The greenhouse gases GHGs emissions in China have a rapid growth accounting for about of global GHGs emission Waste reuse and recycle can relieve the shortage of resources and environmental pressure in China In the case of China the circular economy has been introduced as a new development model to help China leapfrog into a more sustainable economic structure According to the Circular Economy Promotion Law of the Peoples Republic of China the Circular Economy refers to the general term of the activities on reducing reusing and recycling in production circulation and consumption A consensus has been reached whereby Chinas circular economy concept in many ways which emphasizes the benefits of utilizing residual waste materials including energy water various byproducts as well as information Under the circular economy concepts the treatment and recycling of solid waste in China was greatly improved As the relevant implementation field of circular econ omy concepts China has made great efforts including the laws and policies and some pilot projects to deal with the waste issues and reduce the waste generation volume from the source In the reuse field it mainly refers to encouraging the remanufacturing and the Measures for the Administration of Remanufactured Product Certification Scope was released by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Now remanufacturing is under the pilot stage and the critical area focuses on vehicle parts machine tools engineering machinery mining machinery agricultural machinery metallurgical roller copier computer servers and remanufacturing cartridges and drums etc Currently China has accumulated some useful experiences and is also facing with many challenges for the waste prevention This study aims to provide some compelling information on the sustainable waste management under the concepts of the circular economy and it is expected to be useful for the other countries This study mainly focuses on the household waste particularly municipal solid wastes MSW ewaste and end of life vehicles ELV Firstly the current situation of circular economy development from the perspective of the legal regime and pilot projects are introduced Then the typical household waste generation and recycling status are summarized Finally the potential challenges and opportunities for waste prevention through R in China are identified and effective measures for future improvement are proposed Policies and legislations on circular economy in China At present over national circular economy standards and laws established the systematic system of the circular economy in China and can be divided into four levels State laws Administration regulations Ministry regulations and Local statues The detailed legal regime of circular economy in China is shown in Fig The first level State lawsSince Environmental Protection Leading Group established in the waste management treatment and disposal were started in China The fundamental environmental law Environmental Protection Law was enacted in which stipulated that Producers should use high resource utilization equipment and process with less pollution and the waste should be recycled and utilized comprehensively The laws related to circular economy mainly include Solid Waste Pollution Prevention Law Circular Economy Promotion Law and Clean Production Promoting Law Thereinto Solid Waste Pollution Prevention Law enacted in had already involved some basic system of circular economy Circular Economy Promotion Law implemented from January marked our countrys legalization management track of circular economy which takes R rules reduce reuse recycle and priority to reduce as the essential principles for Chinas economic and social development and puts forward the extended producer responsibility EPR The Circular Economy in the law refers to the general term of the activities on decrement recycling and resource recovery in production circulation and consumption Besides it is the third law associated with the circular economy in the world after those of Germany and Japan Furthermore it serves as a fundamental law guiding all circular economy policies and a solid foundation for depth development of the circular economy in China J Mater Cycles Waste Manag The state also formulated related development plan ning and policies to promote the development of the cir cular economy The twentythird chapter of th FiveYear plan for national economic and social development of the Peoples Republic of China is energetically developing the circular economy And the State Council also adopted a th FiveYear plan for the development of the circular economy in which cleared the primary objective essential tasks and safeguard measures of the development of the circular economy Several Opinions on Accelerating the Development of the Circular Economy was a programmatic document for the development of circular economy in China The second level Administration regulationsThe second level in the legal regime of the circular econ omy are some regulations and administrative measures approved by State Council including Regulation for the Administration of Recycling and Treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Management Measures on Retrieving Scrapped Automobiles and Administration Regulations of City Appearance and Environment Sanitation The Regulation for the Administration of Recy cling and Treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment which is known as Chinese WEEE was implemented since January The purpose of this regulation is to improve the recovery and disposal of ewaste facilitate the comprehensive utilization of resources and protect the environment and human health The related Catalog Multicollection Centralized Treatment Development Plan Qualification Licensing Treatment Fund and other supporting system on the ewaste management have also been carried out The third level Ministry regulations Besides the abovementioned laws and regulations some ministries and commissions also issued regulations and measures to promote the circular economy implementation For instance Recovery and Management measures on renewable resources stipulated that governments would encourage all urban and rural residents to recover renewable resources promote the renewable resource recycling under an environmentally sound way and support the scientific research recycling technology development of renewable resources Moreover some other rules such as Administration Regulations of End of Life Vehicles Collecting and Dismantling exposure draft and Remanufactured Product Management Interim Measures are still under the formulation and modification processFig The main legal regime of circular economy in China J Mater Cycles Waste Manag The fourth level Local statues Some local governments issued the regulations succes sively but most provinces and cities have not enacted any regulations for the development of the regional circular economy Regulation on the Construction of Crcular Economy Ecocity Ordinance implemented on st January in Guiyang City Guizhou Province is the first local circular economy regulation in China After that other provinces such as Shanxi Province Shaanxi Province and Gansu Province also issued the regulations to improve the circular economy of their local governments Beijing Yunnan Province and Jiangxi Province etc promulgated the implementing rules of cleaner production audit Shanghai enacted the Recovery and Management Measures on Renewable Resources in Shanghai Meanwhile some industrial parks have also issued their own rules such as Administration for Tianjin Ziya Circular Economy Industrial Zone enacted in The establishment of local laws and regulations has laid a good legal basis for the development of the circular economy The development of circular economy on waste prevention through R From to energy consumptions reducing rates per ten thousand yuan GDP increased from to and the clean energy consumption rates to the total energy consumption rose from to National Bureau of Statistics of the Peoples Repubic of China firstly released the circular economy development index of China This index took as the base year the index in equals to and reached in with an average annual increase of Fig which indicated the significant achievements of circular economy development in China In this study the circular economy development index consists of resource consumption intensity waste emission intensity waste recycling rate and waste disposal rate In the resource consumption intensity index was in China higher than that in The average annual growth was which indicated that the resource consumption was being reduced steadily The waste emission intensity index was in with a mean annual improvement of since This index contains four secondary indexes which mainly indicate the waste generation per unit such as the wastewater discharge per GDP and an increase in the index means a reduction in emissions Due to the significant growth of the industrial solid waste emissions the waste emission intensity index of was decreased points compared with that of and then the index was significantly rebounded in and Compared with the waste reduction effect was apparent The pollution disposal rate index was in with an average annual increase of compared to which showed the pollutants disposal level was improved significantly The waste recycling rate index consists of four main components the recovery rate of energy the recycling rate of waste resources the recycling rate of industry water and the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial solid wastes This index was with the smallest improvement in the four indexes and it continued to decrease from because of the decline of waste resource reuse rate The results of those indexes demonstrated that the circular economy development in China had made some good improvements but the progress of waste reuse was still slow and should be paid more attentions on Waste disposal investment situation According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics of China the total pollution control investment was increased year by year in China from billion yuan in to billion yuan in The total environmental pollution investment ratio accounting for the total GDP increased from in to but the investment proportion of solid waste treatment declined to in Fig At present the EU countries invested more than billion euros per year in environmental protection accounting for more than of GDP The gap is noticeable comprising more than of environmental investment in developed countries As for the investment for solid waste disposal the trend was uncertain In the investment for solid waste treatment reached the highest after that began to decline in and and there was a slight increase in On the whole the investment on solid waste pollution control only accounted for of gross investment in the industrial pollution control in recent years while the investment rate of waste water and waste gas were about and respectively much higher than solid waste investment Fig Circular economy development index in China from to J Mater Cycles Waste Manag The circular economy pilot projects According to Accelerating the Development of Circular Economy approved by the state council National Development and Reform Commission and other six commissions two batches of Circular Economy demonstration pilots circular economy development cases were carried out in and Meanwhile from to the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance had also approved six batches of a total of urban mining national demonstration bases The circular economy demonstration pilot project had greatly promoted the development of waste utilization industry There are over renewable resources enter prises registered recovery network points more than collecting and processing plants and million employees It has made significant progress from the perspectives of the industrial scale technology level and development patterns According to Report on the development of Chinas renewable resources recovery industry the total amount of resource recovery including ewaste ELV steel scrap and other ten categories was about million tons in with the economic benefits of over billion yuan Current situation on typical waste generation and recycling Municipal solid wastes MSW refer to the solid waste generated in urban daily life or activities to provide services as well as the solid waste regarded under the laws and administrative rules in China The amount of MSW increased very fast in China owing to its rapid urbanization and industrialization and the growth rate ranks first in the world and its total amount ranks at the forefront of highyielding countries According to the data from National Bureau of Statistics of China the annual MSW collection and disposal in China keeps the fast increasing as shown in Fig Until the delivering quantity of MSW was million tons with average annual growth rate of The components of the MSW in China are involved and can divide into organic matter such as food residue and inorganic matter which account for about and respectively The trend of harmless disposal of MSW was also increasing yearly and the disposal rate increased from in to in The safe disposal quantity was million tons in including landfill disposal amount of million tons incineration disposal quantity of million tons and the remaining treatment The rest of waste with no harmless disposal was often stacked or ended in a simple landfill According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics of China the number of MSW harmless treatment facilities is shown in Fig and the total number increased from in to in The number of MSW landfill site grew from to Until the treatment capacity of landfill facilities was about tonsday the number of MSW incineration plants increased from to and the capacity was tonsday Landfill capacity is stable with a slight growth in the last ten years and it is still the mainstream processing technology the waste incineration were keeping rapid growth however the garbage composting facilities decreased in China In future the Fig Investment on pollution treatment in China Fig MSW collection and harmless disposal in China Fig MSW harmless disposal facilities in China J Mater Cycles Waste Manag comprehensive treatment technologies and facilities of municipal solid waste including landfill incineration and composting technologies together will be the new development trends Based on the data of Ministry of Environment of Japan we do some comparisons of the MSW generation between China and Japan as shown in Fig The discharge quantity in Japan presented a downward trend from million tons in to million tons in and the annual MSW generation per capital also decreased from to kg In China although the total MSW generation is much higher than Japan the annual MSW generation per capital is lower and also showed a decline trend since In addition the Japanese minimization rate of MSW were up to above in those years and the recycling utilization rate is about Meanwhile because the MSW has been made an excellent classification when people throw them away many valuable materials mainly including poly ethylene glycol terephthalate PET tin aluminum cans glass bottles paper plastic in the MSW can be directly recovered However in China the waste sorting collection system still need to be improved Different from Japan at present most of the urban MSW sorting facilities in China are simple and the trash classification is too academic For example the expressions organic and inorganic recyclable and unrecyclable and so on makes most of the residents impossible to identify and put the trash on the right cans Due to the lack of awareness on waste classification recycling the MSW was mixed collected mostly While at the same time for the existence of waste pickers or informal recycling staffs who pick up and purchase the recyclable resources in MSW the recycling utilization rate in China is not low actually According to the projection in the waste pickers recovered about million tons waste in Beijing accounting for of the total generationEwaste The theory generation amount of typical ewaste including television TV refrigerator RF washing machine WM air conditioner AC and personal computer PC was estimated shown in Fig It suggests that the expected ewaste generation has increased steadily from to and million units of five kinds of ewaste about million tons were generated in Up to the end of enterprises covering prov inces have been listed as WEEE subsidy funded companies The total processing capacities exceeded million units and over million ewaste the main five types were dismantled and recycled in Figure shows the recycling rate of ewaste dismantling amount in the formal recycling enterprises to theoretical ewaste generation in China It indicates that the recycling rate has increased from in to in Due to the Old for New policy there was a significant increase in the collection and dismantling quantities in The dismantling amount of TV was million of China which is higher than the theoretical ewaste generation of that year That is because the dismantling amount of TV had actually included the history accumulations and the subsidy of TV in the subsidy of ewaste treatment version was relatively high The TV dismantling amount contributed over to the total quantity But the other four appliances recycling rates were still low the AC recycling rate was only and the recycling rate of the three kinds of electrical appliances were varied in the range of From the first batch of WEEE subsidy funded companies was announced in a processorbased recovery model has been formed And the recycling rate increased from less than in According to the data of Eurostat Database and other reports the recycling rates of ewaste in different countries are shown in Fig The recycling rates of Nor way United Kingdom Denmark and Germany are calculated according to the ewaste collection quantity and Fig MSW generation in China and Japan Fig Theoretical ewaste generation and dismantling quantity in China J Mater Cycles Waste Manag electronic products sale date The electronic products mar ket of developed countries has been basically saturated so electronic product sales data are used instead of waste data The recycling rates of European Union countries and Japan are higher than especially in Norway and Japan And the recycling rate in the United States is nearly Comparing with the other countries Chinas recycling and dismantling rate are still low in the future the formal ewaste recovery and treatment still has a long way to go End of life vehiclesThe situation of the auto market in China maintains steady growth the auto production and sales keep the first position of the world for six years and were million units and million units in respectively At the same time the quantity of end of life vehicles is also enormous According to Industry Development Report of Recycled Resources in China theoretical deregistered vehicles amount is shown in Fig From the figure it can be seen that the recycling number of end of life vehicles present a growth trend While due to the implementation of national policies such as Auto Replacement Approach the large accumulation of ELV went into retirement program in a short time and made the larger fluctuations of recycling volume The recycling amount of ELV in reached million From to the recycling amount kept stable In the State Council issued the Notice on the issuance of the air pollution control action plan it required to accelerate the elimination of yellow label vehicles and old vehicles and it speeded up the rate of the vehicle scrapped Then the next year the deregistered vehicles quantity came back an average growth level while compared with the number decreased somewhat to million In the dismantling amount and recy cling rate reached the highest The theoretical deregistered vehicles number was million in China and the recycling and dismantling ELV was million of the deregistered vehicles The ELV recycling industry in China developed stead ily the qualified enterprises amounted to in with an increase of compared with Also the recov ery outlets have reached increased by to and the ELV collection and recycling network have covered more than areas in China Moreover the recycling and dismantling quantity of ELV increased that year There were three final destinations of the ELVs in China about of the officially deregistered vehicles were dismantled in authorized facilities and the others were illegally dismantled or flowed into the underground market with the proportion of about In the Japanese ELV deregistered amount is about million and dismantling quantity is million the dismantling rate was over The rate refers to the proportion of the normally disassemble number in deregistered amount In the United States of ELV are recycled and the recycled parts weight up to of the total weight of each recovery vehicle However in China the dismantling rate was only The Japanese government enforced the ELV Recycling Law in January It explicitly stipulates the typical automobile shredder residues ASR airbags chlorofluorocarbonshydrofluorocarbons CFCsHFCs should be collected and recovered by vehicle manufacturers and importers during the process of recycling ELV The average recycling rate of ASR increased from in to around and air bag average utilization rate remained at about How ever in China little attention had been paid to the recycling and management of the ASR and airbags Although the Automotive Products Recycling Technology Policy stipulates that the components with potential toxic substances such as batteries airbags catalyst coolant and so on must Yellow label is the nickname of highly polluting emissions vehicle and it refers to gasoline vehicles which are not up to the I emission standard or diesel vehicles which do not meet the III diesel emissions standards Fig Ewaste recycling rate of different countries in Fig Theoretical deregistered vehicles and recycling quantities in China J Mater Cycles Waste Manag be handled by qualified enterprises In fact part of waste fluid and toxic materials often discharged directly into soil without any treatment in some place Furthermore the ELV recycling mainly focused on the scrap metal recovery and the recycling rate is below in China Problems and challenges Under the concept of circular economy China has made inspiring achievements in waste management however at the same time there are still some problems and challenges Regarding waste management the policies and regulations system in China is still imperfect there are only some basic laws and lack of special regulations about the particular waste like ELV packaging waste and so on Besides the legislations are not very clear for some contents The coordination of relevant laws and regulations is insufficient and solid waste disposal responsibilities are unclear As for some waste recycling industry like ELV recycling the incentives from policies are still inadequate and the tax is so high that it weakens the motivation of industry development The investment in environmental pollution control accounted for about of GDP in China which is far below other developed countries and the national investment on solid waste treatment is smaller than that of waste water and air Circular economy demonstration pilot projects have highly promoted the development of waste utilization industry But the space layout of pilot projects was not reasonable and made the transportation distance between waste resources and recycled products too long which affected the economic performance and significantly reduced the overall efficiency Under the current waste generation and recycling situ ation the MSW generation annually continued to increase from million tons to million tons from to However most of the MSW was mixed collected in China Hence it caused a waste of the resources to a cer tain degree Source reduction of the MSW is the most fundamental way to solve the MSW problems In future the waste sorting collection and source prevention still need to be improved in China The dismantling quantities and recycling rate of ewaste have made great improvement but when compared with developed countries Chinas formal recycle and dismantling rate is still low The informal sector occupies most of the recycling channels Lack of business model in the channel of resources recovery is still the biggest problem in some waste recycling and dismantling enterprises like ewaste In the future the formal ewaste recovery and treatment still has a long way to goThe theoretical quantity of ELV in China is enormous but recycling and dismantling part in qualified enterprises only accounted for of the vehicles ownership Comparing with the developed countries such as Japan whose rate was about it was relatively low And very little attention had been paid to the recycling and management of the ASR and airbags Except for the above aspects another challenge is that the overall technology and equipment employed for resources regeneration from waste is still at a relatively low level For example in ELV dismantling industry there is no standardized industrial dismantling line and many companies still use manual dismantling while a large propor tion of the dismantling process in the developed countries are conducted with automotive equipment Meanwhile some solid waste recycling technology standards need to be improved like the rare and precious metals extraction and hazardous substances removal The absence of supervision measures on the comprehensive utilization of solid waste also hindered the development of the technological innovation to some extent On the other hand the collection channel of Inter net Collection mode gradually emerged especially for ewaste Through the internet service platform and offline service system the online of delivery waste and offline of logistics under the Internet collection mode were gradually changing the traditional small scattered and poor condition of recycling Moreover waste prevention through R as the primary coverage of circular economy can alleviate environment and resource pressure cultivate new economic growth points and realize the operation mode of cir cular economy And accompany with the rapid development of renewable resources utilization source classification further improvement of the recycling system environmental education and the implementation of the production responsibility system the proportion and quantities of renewable resources recovery will be further developed Conclusions and suggestions In past ten years remarkable achievements in circular economy development in China have been obtained and a relatively perfect legal system of circular economy has been established Moreover the effectiveness of waste recycling and utilization is obvious The quantity of MSW treated with a harmless way is continuously increasing but the Internet is the innovation on the Internet with the depth of the economic society in various fields to promote technological progress promote the real economy innovation and productivity to form more widely on the Internet for infrastructure and innovation elements in new form of social and economic development J Mater Cycles Waste Manag annual waste generation per capita shows a trend of decline at the same time The recycling rates of ewaste and ELV increased from and in to and in respectively However there is still a gap in the development level of the Circular economy between China and other developed countries eg related management policies and regulations are still insufficient Some effective measures should be carried out to improve the current waste management and recycling situation First it is necessary to continue to promote the establishment of legal framework on the cir cular economy and gradually achieve zero waste society Secondly available technologies are the keys for the efficient resource recycling and sanitary disposal more research funds should be invested to enhance technology innovation and development Thirdly waste management infrastructures including domestic waste sorting collection facilities waste separation facilities and disposal facilities are the essential basis for achieving the waste reduction resource recovery and safety disposal Strengthen the construction of waste treatment facilities will promote the development of waste management significantly Acknowledgements The work was financially supported by the Hong Kong Macao and Taiwan Science Technology
