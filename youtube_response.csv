Brook B,"I just binged 6-7 of your videos, and I&#39;m now convinced that the Netherlands are a mythical fantasy land where simply living your life isn&#39;t an inconvenience."
John Wick,"As a Dutchie, also living in Amsterdam, I always find your videos fascinating. <br>If you grow up in the same environment, often you takes things for granted while they are actually very clever designed."
KingCohen,"Imagine if we took all the good, innovative and smart factors of cities from around the world and implemented them into other cities... it would be so amazing"
Thunderhawk51,"For someone who&#39;s been living his whole life in a country like Finland, that feels beyond absurd. Granted, I never lived in a big city and we don&#39;t have raccoons here. But in towns/cities, you don&#39;t have your own garbage bin. The neighborhood or the building you live in will have them and you don&#39;t have to worry about them. And there are dedicated recycling areas around the city.<br><br>Another thing I&#39;d like to mention is that we get money when we return the bottles and cans back to the shops. 0.15€ from cans 0,10€/0,20€/0,40€ from bottles. That amount is already included in the product price, but we can get it back. There are machines in the shops that you put them in and it gives you a ticket that you can turn into money or use it to buy something. The bottles and cans are then recycled and reused. I&#39;m quite interested which other countries have this kind of a system in use? I know Sweden does at least."
Miguel Pereira,We have this in Portugal since the 2000s. Didn’t know it was such an advanced thing
iaadsi,"Our neighborhood in Prague replaced regular above ground dumpsters with these a few years ago. It wasn&#39;t accepted well. The underground dumpsters have receptacles smaller than common garbage bags, so you need to cram your garbage into it with force. Sometimes bags burst, so these hightech underground dumpsters are surrounded by heaps of rotting trash that didn&#39;t fit in.<br><br>The old dumpsters had a sliding lid that opened to a 1 by 1.5 meter opening, you could throw in a 100 liter bag once a week. Now we need to use smaller bags (30-40 liter) and go more often (so more plastic bags, more time spent).<br><br>The old dumpsters could be picked up and emptied by the garbage truck inside of 20 seconds. The underground one needs a crane and a crew of men guiding it with rods, and it takes 1-2 minutes each. Every Tuesday morning is a race to beat the garbage truck, because it clogs the one-way street for 20+ minutes."
Wonder World,"That is a really clever way to handle garbage. We don&#39;t have racoons or possums getting into our garbage in Australia, but sometimes a dog may open a lid and pull out some garbage, but it&#39;s rare these days."
SiLlYgOosE,This isn’t ideal for all cities but man New York could definitely use it!
Samimies,"In Finland, I had no idea that trash day was a thing. I laughed at the prospect of having to haul your trash out once every two weeks!"
parranoic,This work only when you have a responsible government that empties them on regular basis. We had those installed in my neighborhood and they got filled really quickly and the area around them and it smelled...
NoSoyNadieImportante,"In Spain there is neither &quot;Garbage day&quot;. Garbage is collected everyday (important due to the hot weather in summer). Containers are usually in the streets and in many cities, specially in historic districts, there are as well many underground containers."
Chris,"Actually, this should be titled &quot; Every day is garbage day in Amsterdam.&quot;"
peddler931,There is a story of a California park ranger who was discussing the problem of creating a bear-resistant garbage can. He summarised the problem as follows: &quot;There is considerable overlap in intelligence between our smartest bears and our dumbest tourists.&quot;
Generic PseudoName,"We have those in Romania too. Garbage day is still a thing in smaller communities but even in cities with ~50k inhabitants (or at least my city), the dumpsters are underground like that. I really like them this way (one downside being that they are harder to close when poorly maintained) because they keep things tidy and keep dumpster divers out.<br><br>Edit: Actually it&#39;s just a substitute for normal dumpsters, suburbs still have garbage day."
ViniciusSC10,"I live in greater São Paulo and in my city we have trash collection 3 times a week, plus recycling collection in the other 2 days remaining. That Toronto’s schedule is a little weird because you’ve to keep your trash in your home for a really time.<br><br>But, about the garbage container in Amsterdam: simply genius. I hope this trend grows worldwide."
Alrighty,"I agree, trash pandas are a nuisance. Would love to see this implemented here in Canada"
KuariThunderclaw,"Things like this are why when solving any issue, a government should first look at what other countries are doing and asking &quot;Can we do this too instead of coming up with a super expensive new solution that might not even work?&quot;"
David Collier,A town we stayed in in the Netherlands had the same &quot;no garbage day&quot; system. Unfortunately people are the same the World over and a lot of the garbage found its way onto the street somewhere near the receptacles provided. Taking out the garbage was a rubber gloves and gumboots job.
technojunkie123,"So they basically took the concept that works in most apartment complexes, where you just throw your trash into a central location as needed &amp; it get picked up (mostly) regularly, and applied it to the whole city? That&#39;s literally genius!"
