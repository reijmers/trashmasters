vol clean technologies and environmental policy  original paper steps toward a resilient circular economy in india joseph fiksel praveena sanjay kavya raman received september accepted october springerverlag gmbh germany part of springer nature abstract developing nations including india face a number of daunting challenges in the twentyfirst century including popula tion growth political strife rapid urbanization food and water scarcity environmental pollution infectious diseases and climate change in this turbulent era there is a need for resilience at every levelfrom the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government we argue that achieving resilience will require both enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to these challenges such practical first steps can serve as models for creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in india one way to stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials thus seeking to eliminate waste previous research has shown that such initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community resilience while stimulating the regional economy an international conference on waste management innovation held in in mumbai with funding from the us consulate general resulted in the award of seed grants to two indian nonprofits that sought to apply circular economy principles to regional communitiesone urban and one rural these initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation the world institute of sustainable energy has developed an action plan to capture at least percent of the electronic waste generated in the city of pune one of the largest metropolitan areas in india their approach is based on circular economy principles and has been embraced in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents and nongovernmental organizations barefoot college has established and demonstrated a lowcost endtoend solid waste management model for rural villages that is designed by the local community their unique approach ensures sanitation environmental protection income and livelihood generation and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene this paper presents the results of these two efforts and suggests what lessons were learned one overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is necessary to understand the interplay of economic environmental and social forces joseph fiksel fikselosuedu praveena sanjay praveenaccswiseinorg kavya raman kavyaramangmailcom the ohio state university columbus

pro producer responsibility organization sdgs sustainable development goals the need for resilience in recent years the rapid growth of the indian economy has been accompanied by an array of social and environmental stress factors including population growth political strife rapid urbanization food and water scarcity environmental pollution and climate change by half of indias population will live in cities and municipal solid waste volume is expected to triple to about million metric tons mt lal while india has committed to the un sustain able development goals sdgs termed the agenda un progress is hampered by haphazard urban development and ineffective regulatory controls moreover the focus on longterm sustainability is often trumped by social and political turbulence as well as unexpected disruptions such as terrorism industrial accidents and extreme weather events most recently the covid pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the health and safety of indias diverse population as well as to indias burgeoning economy unfor tunately the adverse impacts of these stress factors will disproportionately affect the informal sectors of the economy where hundreds of millions of lowercaste workers struggle to support themselves and their families in this time of disruptive change there is a clear need for resilience at every levelfrom the peasant family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government we define resilience as the capacity for a system to survive adapt and flourish in the face of turbulent change and uncertainty fiksel in the context of economic development the system is extremely complex since it involves producers supply chains consumers waste handlers regulators and nongovernmental organizations that may be located in different geographic zones moreover a true systems view must consider the social and environmental consequences of remaining in the current state the potential benefits to various stakeholders of proposed adaptations and the accompanying uncertainties resilience is often confounded with sustainability the two concepts are closely related but quite different in scope and time scale sustainability represents a longterm view considering how decisions that we make today will influence steps toward a resilient circular economy in india the wellbeing of both present and future generations it is based on an idealistic view of productive harmony between humans and the environment resilience is a more prag matic realtime conceptconsidering how to overcome unexpected disruptions while building an organization or community that embraces change generally speaking we can say that a sustainable system is more resilient to disruptions and a resilient system is more sustainable in the long run in other words sustainability and resilience are distinct but mutually reinforcing however sustainability and resilience may not always be synergistic there are situations where sustainability and resilience are opposing rather than reinforcing for example by storing backup supplies a company may improve business continuity but this also increases the environmental footprint in the indian context we argue that both resilience and sustainability can be achieved by a combination of enlightened government policies based on systems thinking as well as successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators these practical first steps can serve as models to be replicated thus defining a path forward toward a resilient and sustainable indian economy waste management challenges in india for purposes of achieving both sustainability and resilience a critical area that must be addressed in india is the management of municipal industrial and agricultural wastes in both urban and rural areas as of urban areas in india representing about million people generated million mt of municipal solid waste each year of this only about are collected due to insufficient municipal ser vices about of the collected wastes are treated and the remaining are disposed in open landfills without proper treatment or containment based on changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth urban municipal solid waste generation is projected to reach million mt by india environment portal in rural areas agricultural wastes including crop and animal residues are often burnt in the fields or used as traditional household fuels these practices have resulted in severe pollution of air soil and water creating health problems for both workers and nearby households recycling and composting programs are unable to keep pace with the growth of waste although small startup companies and ngos are introducing new solutions ranging from hightech waste processing to improve training and support for waste picker communities fiksel and lal in theory much of this waste could be beneficially used as renewable energy or materials however the challenges of modernizing waste collection segregation treatment and disposal are enormous following the establishment of the swachh bharat clean india mission in a series of more stringent rules were issued in for solid waste management including specific requirements for plastic wastes electronic wastes construction and demolition debris biomedical wastes and hazardous wastes however despite these regulatory efforts the indian economy will continue to generate growing waste streams due to increase in population urbanization crops and livestock resulting in significant human health and environmental impacts for india to achieve continued economic growth poverty alleviation hunger elimination human development and environmental improvement new transformative solutions are needed rather than incremental improvements beyond the obvious concerns about waste proliferation improved waste management is important for controlling a significant source of greenhouse gases ghgsmethane emissions from landfills as well as nitrous oxide and methane from agricultural waste combustion moreover material throughput is a major driver of ghg emissions and hence waste reduction will significantly decrease energy and material demand and the associated ghg emissions throughout global supply chains fiksel this paper describes the results of a conference on waste management innovation held in mumbai in april with the purpose of stimulating waste minimization strategies based on circular economy principles osu the conference was sponsored by the us consulate in mumbai which offered seed grants to nonprofit organizations for demonstration of innovative approaches the accomplishments of two grantee organizations are described belowone in an urban context and the other in a rural context circular economy opportunities the concept of circular economy as a strategy for waste elimination has been broadly adopted in the business world companies have sought to achieve zero waste by finding uses for discarded materials and closing the loop in their supply network circularity not only offers economic benefits and reduces a companys ecological footprint but also increases both business and community resilience by reducing dependence upon scarce resources and longdis tance supply chains the concept has been implemented by progressive business leaders as a costeffective means of improving corporate sustainability and resilience ellen macarthur foundation the practice of circular economy requires a systems approach that considers the broader economic social and environmental systems in which commercial supply chains operate figure shows how a systems approach can be used to model the generation and disposition of wastes throughout the business value chain this approach is based j fiksel et al on the triple value framework which explicitly maps the interdependencies among three types of dynamic systemsindustries communities and the environment fiksel et al resources are extracted from the environment move through production processes to create value for markets and then the wastes are disposed or recycled the lifecycle stages shown in fig include extraction of raw materials from terrestrial sources transport processing manufactur ing and packaging into finished products distribution and product support through various market channels consumer use of products and final disposal or recycling of the residual wastes these wastes are generated in solid liquid and gaseous forms and may include hazardous pollutants and greenhouse gases in this type of holistic analysis it is important to account for direct consequences such as financial benefits as well as indirect or unintended consequences including environmental and social impacts the circular economy strategy envisions that industrial and consumer wastes can replace virgin materialsso that inefficient and harmful waste disposal is essentially elimi nated many existing waste streams are underutilized for example municipal solid waste contains about of biomass and other combustible materials comprising a mixture of energyrich fuels likewise coal combustion residues from power plants such as fly ash bottom ash boiler slag and flue gas desulfurization residues can be beneficially used in concrete and cement production structural fills building products gypsum wallboard and surface stabilization the world economic forum estimates that based on current technologies the circular economy approach could save more than trillionyr globally due to lower costs lower carbon emissions and supply chain risk reduction wef circular economy practices include reverse logistics eg refurbishment of containers pallets used or defective products beneficial reuse of wasted materials or energy eg composting used oil recovery biodiges tion of organics combined heat and power and business model innovation eg dematerialization resource pooling productasaservice a particularly effective circular economy practice is called byproduct synergy bps first introduced by the us business council for sustainable development and widely adopted by companies in diverse industries cimren et al by collaborating across industry lines companies can avoid landfilling costs and reduce material procurement costs by converting industrial or municipal wastes into feed stocks for other industrial processes thus turning waste into profit this not only contributes to longterm sustainability by reducing a companys ecological footprint but also improves a companys resilience by reducing dependence on imported supplies and scarce resources bps is by far the shortest and most efficient path to achieving a circular economy municipal waste recovery is much more resourceintensive and in any case municipal waste is only a small fraction of the total solid waste generated by industry more broadly taking a systems approach enables har monization of industrial processes with natural processes which provide industries with important ecosystem services such as flood control pollutant absorption and carbon c sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems such as soil vegetation and wetlands fiksel et al these services from nature can mitigate climate change and air pollution restore fig a systems view of circular economy processessteps toward a resilient circular economy in india soil health enhance the quality and renewability of water resources and generally improve the environment today many progressive companies are recognizing the importance of ecosystem services to ensure the resilience of their supply chains and are pursuing resource efficiency together with endoflife waste minimization recovery and reuse fiksel circular economy design should strive to be inclusive by considering how management decisions may impact various stakeholder groups including the poor and other underrepresented segments of society that are especially vulnerable to the health impacts of waste proliferation stewardship of natural capital ie ecological resources and social capital ie community solidarity will help companies to achieve profitable waste reduction or avoidance in ways that not only benefit their shareholders and business partners but also earn the respect and appreciation of public stakeholders thus judicious management of all waste sources industrial agricultural and municipal can advance progress toward many of the un sdgs in particular circular economy practices will contribute to goal environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes including reduction in releases and goal ensuring healthy lives and wellbeing including reduction in deaths and illnesses due to environmental pollution in the agricultural sector best management practices such as conservation agriculture integrated nutrient management and sustainable intensification ie producing more from less can increase soil resilience and restore the carbon pool providing multiple benefitsgreenhouse gas sequestration improved water quality and conserva tion decreased nutrient loss reduced soil erosion greater crop yields and food and nutritional security lal india generates an estimated mmt per year of agricultural wastes but a large proportion of these resources can be composted and used as soil amendments with judicious use of chemical fertilizers this would eliminate the nutrient deficit in agricultural soils while sequestering carbon and improving the health of soil plants animals people and the environment agricultural wastes can also be utilized as industrial raw materials for example rice husk ash is a valuable industrial raw material for steel cement and refractory bricks and can also be used for waste water treatment thermal insulation mortar and concrete production soil amendment and silica production similarly bagasse from sugarcane can be used to generate energy a recent accenture study suggested that india can unlock approximately halfatrillion dollars of economic value by through adoption of circular economy business models as shown in fig this could be achieved by a combination of strategiesreduction in wasted material and energy resources improved utilization of products and capital assets product life extension and value recovery from waste streams fig value realization potential from circular business models by accenture j fiksel et al case study circular economy system for urban electronic waste the world institute of sustainable energy wise is a notforprofit organization established in based in pune india wise is committed to the cause of promoting sustainable energy and sustainable development through the advancement of lowcarbon renewable and energy efficient pathways that pave the way toward achieving the sustainability goals of energy security livelihood security and climate security mediating public policy through pro active interventions is the prime objective of the institute this seed grant supported wises efforts to engage with concerned stakeholders regarding the current electronic waste ewaste management systems and practices in the city of pune the wise team was able to identify the challenges and issues faced by the various stakeholder groups including government authorities civil society organizations private entrepreneurs citizens groups wastepickers and household consumers based on these insights wise developed a comprehensive action plan that provides practical strategies to enable a circular economy for urban ewaste management the electrical and electronics market in india has grown rapidly and was projected to reach billion by assocham however rapid technological obsoles cence and increased consumer purchasing power have led a sharp increase in the generation of ewaste india accounted for million mt of global ewaste in ranking fourth in the world after china the usa and japan within india the state of maharashtra accounted for the most ewaste generation about pune is the cultural and educational capital of maharashtra and one of the eight largest metropolitan cities in the country the pune municipal corporation pmc estimated that the city generated around mt of ewaste in of which only mt was recycled recognizing the urgent need for ewaste recycling wise set out to conduct a detailed study of the challenges and gaps prevalent in punes current ewaste management system the objective of the study was to develop a plan for capturing at least percent of ewaste generated in the next two years by enabling a circular economy system the study methodology involved the following steps step current scenario assessment the wise team performed an assessment of the chal lenges gaps and issues present in the ewaste manage ment system currently present in pune city this included assessment of the current practices and methods adopted by the stakeholders and analysis of their effectiveness at different levelsgovernance technical financial etc assessment of the circular economy framework for ewaste both at the global and national level with the objective of extrapolating best practices in the model ewaste framework for pune city analysis of health and environmental risks associated with unscientific ewaste handling analysis of current ewaste management system and loss in value due to rudimentary techniques and improper handling of ewaste the wise team spent considerable effort to character ize the ewaste regulatory regime and management practices in india see fig ewaste is primarily managed by civil society organizations csos and the private sector government legislation provides the framework for this process and the ewaste management rules include extended producer responsibility the central pollution control board cpcb a statutory body under the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc prepares guidelines for implementation of the ewaste rules by the respective state pollution control boards for pune the maharashtra pollution control board mpcb is the state regulatory body responsible for granting and monitoring authorizations for ewaste management pmc is the urban civic body that governs pune and is responsible for solid waste management in the city pmc currently has only a small ewaste cell in the absence of appropriate guidelines the role of the municipal corporation and the ewaste cell is not defined and there are no dedicated human resources for ewaste management while the pmc has designated temporary centers for collection of ewaste in the city there is an almost complete lack of awareness among citizens regarding these centers this has resulted in the formal sector comprising local ngos and private organizations taking up the responsibility of ewaste management in the city however only a handful of formal ewaste collecting and dismantling centers are currently functioning in pune and of ewaste is managed by the informal sector wastepickers known as kabadiwalas wise found that this group has a keen interest in being part of the formal chain and to work as licensed collectors and expressed the need for regulatory initiatives to integrate them into the formal ewaste chain and assure them of healthy and secure work conditions in summary the following are the key findings of wises assessment of major gaps and challenges related to ewaste management in pune city the current mandate segregates only wet and dry waste no guidelines exist for ewaste segregation and managementsteps toward a resilient circular economy in india there are no defined baseline targets benchmarks or timelines for ewaste management no monitoring and evaluation mechanism is in place resulting in operational inefficiency at different stages of ewaste management there is a lack of proper communication and coordination among the key stakeholders namely mpcb pmc and the formal sector leading to ineffective ewaste gov ernance and management progress is inhibited by lack of appropriate infrastructure capacity building and information awareness along with lack of funding and financial incentives for the formal sector step action plan preparation based on the findings from the above assessments wise proceeded to develop a strategic action plan based fig ewaste management stakeholder roles in india derived from assochamey j fiksel et al on extensive engagement with key stakeholder groups this plan includes oneonone discussions and roundtable meetings with stakeholders comprising waste collectors municipal authorities ngos recyclers and dismantlers established and nonestablished supply chain entities and others separate interactions with domestic consumers to under stand their awareness levels and expectations development of an implementation strategy and corresponding action plan to be carried out over the short term years and long term years by the concerned stakeholders table provides a detailed summary of the strategic action plan a list of acronyms used appears at the end of the paper step knowledge dissemination the action plan was disseminated through a variety of channels including wise and osu websites stakeholder websites email blasts and social media additionally focus group meetings were held to ensure the feasibility of plan implementation the final report of the wise project has met with wide acceptability among city officials and key stakeholders across the value chain in particular the wise team briefed the joint municipal commissioner solid waste management pmc and other key stakeholders and received an enthusiastic response see fig it appears that the rec ommended strategic action plan can pave the way for more informed decisions by policymakers and ewaste chain par ticipants leading to development of a circular economy in pune the following summarizes the strategic action recom mendations that were developed in this project draft guidelines for streamlining ewaste management in pune prescribe rules regulations and penalties if any define stakeholder roles and integrate these into a circular economy framework conduct a baseline study to assess and evaluate the total consumption of resources in the electronics sector and the ewaste generated thus enabling adoption of suitable benchmarks and targets for reducing ewaste such a study would also be relevant for nationallevel targets develop a longterm resource efficiency strategy for pune that would strive for a circular economy reducing both virgin resource use by manufacturers and consumer consumption develop guidelines for mandating a certain percentage of recycled ewaste in manufacturing this will enable strengthening of the formal ewaste sector similar to the renewable purchase obligation that mandates a certain percentage of renewable energy in power purchases conduct impact assessment studies to analyze the health environmental and economic impacts of improper ewaste recycling by the informal sector in pune and at a national level organize capacity building training programs and work shops by pmc for the formal and especially informal sectors on the adverse health and environmental impacts of handling dismantling and recycling ewaste in an improper and unscientific manner develop appropriate business and financial models for a circular ewaste economy that would attract more funding from private institutions into the electrical and electronics sector undertake studies and organize conferences seminars community drives and workshops to educate citizens about the value of adopting a more sustainable lifestyle carry out feasibility studies for designing product ser vice systems that would integrate products services supporting networks and infrastructure to reduce waste and form a circular economy conduct research to facilitate adoption of the cradletocradle approach transitioning from a resourceintensive to a resourceefficient economy that decouples the environmental footprint from economic prosperity and human wellbeing ie doing more with less for longer case study waste management system for rural villages the social work and research centre widely known as barefoot college is a voluntary organization founded by bunker roy in fulltime volunteers are working in the fields of education skill development health drinking water women empowerment and electrification through solar power for the upliftment of rural people rural areas of india present a different set of challenges from those that exist in densely populated cities in rural villages there tends to be a lack of understanding of the importance of personal hygiene and proper waste disposal the objective of this seed grant was to establish and demonstrate a lowcost endtoend rural solid waste manage ment model that is designed by the local community this model aims to ensure sanitation environmental protection and income and livelihood generation and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene thus

print and digital media publicity managers consumer forums thinktankssteps toward a resilient circular economy in india the village selected for this project was nalu near the campus of barefoot college in the ajmer district of rajasthan the population consists of approximately families comprising a total of residents the major occupations of these villagers include farming animal husbandry marble industry firework factories many are employed as contract laborers including work supported by the national rural employment guarantee act which aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least days of wage employment per year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work drinking water electricity education and basic health facilities are available in the village however sanitation facilities and practices are notably deficient although of the families have toilets only about half of these families actually use their toilets the rest practice open defecation in the fields a traditional practice that they find more agreeable than being shut in a small room moreover the community lacks any type of waste management system so that most trash is simply burned or discarded in nearby fields baseline survey in january a baseline survey was conducted to understand the current knowledge attitudes and practices of the community related to waste disposal and management each household in the village was visited to understand the general attitudes and survey data were collected from of the households the survey results are shown in fig key findings were as follows existing waste disposal system while organic waste and metals are largely disposed in a nonharmful manner composting or selling nonbiodegradable waste materials such as plastics cloth rubber are either dumped in the open or burned these practices threaten the integrity of local soils and water bodies and may endanger the health of both humans and grazing animals existing cleaning arrangements members of the sweeper community are forced to clean villages for low and infrequent wages they are a marginalized and oppressed group treated as untouchables by the rest of the village and are not allowed to engage in other livelihood activities interest in a waste management system all households agreed upon the need for a scientific waste management system and were prepared to support the system with a monthly contribution of rs about cents per household stakeholder involvement the local governance body panchayat consisting of influential men and women from the community was completely aligned with the fig joint municipal commissioner pmc dnyaneshwar molak center launches the wise report on enabling a circular economy for ewaste in pune city accompanied by stakeholders and wise staff j fiksel et al idea of setting up a waste management system in the vil lage and expressed support toward maintaining such a system system design accordingly the barefoot college team set out to design a lowcost endtoend rural solid waste management system with the participation of the village community illustrated in fig the team estimated that the system would employ about or cleanliness work ers per village and that a supervisor would be appointed in each village once trained the supervisor could most likely take responsibility for or neighboring villages in the region implementation of this design in the village of nalu was accomplished by the fall of enabling the following key activities waste collection the cleanliness workers collect segregated waste from households every day waste is segregated into organic plastic and other recyclables and hazardous at the household level waste collection is accomplished using an electricpowered cart fig percent of nalu households following various disposal practices for different kinds of waste fig overview of the design and operation of a rural waste management systemsteps toward a resilient circular economy in india waste treatment all waste is transported to the recy cling facility for processing as follows a organic waste is converted into nutrientrich com post through a month lowcost composting technique b recyclable waste is further segregated into plastic bottles plastic food packaging polyethylene bags cloth glass rubber metal cardboard and other materials each type of waste is stored separately and sold to recycling plants periodically c biomedical wastes such as sanitary pads diapers and bloodstained cloth are incinerated d any other residual waste is sent to a sanitary landfill after implementation of this system less than of household waste is being sent to the landfills e all the waste collected is weighed daily and documented waste value recovery compost and recyclable waste are sold and the revenue generated is reinvested into the system to offset operational cost a service charge is also collected from the village residents to ensure longterm ownership of the system implementation of this project proceeded through the following series of steps step community sensitization february and march of were spent generating awareness of the project and sensitizing the community to the importance of waste management focus group dis cussions mass awareness sessions using puppetry householdlevel awareness generation and randomized awareness meetings were conducted to engage the villagers in dialogue and inform them about appropriate waste management and source segregation methods these activities included seven informal group discussions engaging people four ward level awareness presentations engaging women one mass awareness puppet show engaging resi dents two cleaning camps in the government school involving more than students sensitization workshops with a village youth group members and a group of local governance officials nine members as a result almost every person in the village was made aware of the concept that was being introduced and was supportive of setting up a waste management system in the village step leadership and commitment in march an allfemale village committee was formed to design build and implement the waste man agement system this approach ensures local relevance of the design as well as longterm sustainability and owner ship of the system within the community the committee mobilized residents to contribute money toward the waste management system and was able to raise rs about from the local governance gram panchayat and other influential village families step recycling infrastructure during april the team focused on setting up household infrastructure to promote source segregation discarded oil cans were refurbished to create visually appealing and functional dustbins in a period of one month more than shand oil cans were washed painted and marked with organic waste plastic and other dry waste and hazardous waste the bins were distributed to households as well as the shops schools and other publicly used spaces in the village this activity had the following advantages no new material was used to manufacture the dustbins which served as a message to the community that old and discarded items can be refurbished into useful and attractive products the cost per dustbin was almost half of the price to pur chase new dustbins of similar quality five local people were given employment for to weeks for preparation of the bins step waste treatment infrastructure the local governance body gram panchayat allocated land to the organization to build waste management infrastructure from april to june the land was leveled cleared of bushes fenced and made ready for construction four compost pits and one segregation and storage unit were constructed to treat all the waste generated by the village step village cleanup from june to august two persons from the mar ginalized dalit community in the village were selected and trained to carry out the activities of sanitation workers the two workers have taken on this role as a fulltime job earning a regular salary through their efforts all the traditional village dumping spots were cleared and have since remained clear of open dumping a landfill was created to replace the existing dump sites j fiksel et al step waste collection launch beginning in july doortodoor collection was ini tiated using a manual cycle trolley however this mode of transport proved to be unsuccessful and laborious due to the many unpaved roads in the village by september an electric threewheeler was purchased making waste collection much faster and easier see fig more houses could be covered each day and the team had more time for segregation and treatment of the waste each household has been trained on source segregation and mixed waste is not accepted from the households student volunteers were engaged in conducting awareness sessions with households to promote source segregation step waste management system the final step of implementation during august to sep tember was the establishment of an ongoing system for treatment storage and recycling of the collected waste wet waste is composted organically in aerobic nadep narayan deotao pandharipande method of composting which uses a wide range of organic materials such as crop residues weeds forest litter and kitchen waste with an endproduct of a fertilizer that serves as a good alternative to farmyard manure within months of filling a pit the pit can be emptied and the compost can be used in fields dry waste is segregated and stored under different categoriesplastics cardboard glass metal cloth etcfor eventual recycling step ongoing operation and monitoring during the final months of the project the operation of the waste management system was closely monitored by barefoot college and a villagelevel supervisor an ongoing process is being developed for supervision of the continued operation and maintenance of the system including maintenance of the resource recovery site and overall performance tracking in summary this project was successful despite numerous challenges including the following waste management and community hygiene are not a priority for village residents hence it is difficult to support such systems solely through community contributions initially the district administration did not provide any support for this project there was a months delay in obtaining the necessary documents for land allocation toward the project which delayed the setup of infrastructure existing waste in various dumping spots around the village was an ongoing hazard since it could not be treated or recycled extreme weather conditions and the heat wave in rajasthan resulted in fewer working hours per day the team was able to work only during early morning and late evening hours notwithstanding these challenges the project demon strated the feasibility of establishing a lowcost communitydriven waste management system in rural villages within the space of one year the beneficial impacts of this work can be summarized as follows environmental protection all dumping areas in the village have been cleared thus preventing animals from eating plastic and other nonbiodegradable waste littered on the streets clogged drains have been cleared of waste water bodies soil and ground water are no longer pol fig villagers bring full dustbins to the waste collection truck steps toward a resilient circular economy in india luted by toxic nonbiodegradable waste making the vil lage hygienic and safe for living behavioral change the village residents including men women and children have been sensitized regarding appropriate waste disposal and management almost all households practice source segregation and have ceased dumping and burning waste in the open livelihood generation two persons from the village have been employed as cleanliness workers earning a regular income and considering themselves as members of a dignified occupational group with high social impact value recovery from waste in the space of months over kg of wet waste were converted to organic compost that is being used to nourish farmers soil approximately kg of dry waste have been segregated and diverted from landfills broader awareness many neighboring villages have learned about this waste management model and are now demanding that it be set up in their communities as well the subdivisional magistrate and block development officer visited the waste management site and have expressed interest in funding replication of this project in other villages it is important to ensure that these benefits are enduring over time and that villagers do not revert to their previous unhygienic practices monitoring of the waste management system is currently being performed by the barefoot college team and the village committee representatives the longterm aim is to fully transition the supervision of the system to the local governance authorities in order to ensure continuity and sustainability the barefoot college team plans to reevaluate the impact of the program after years so that they can better understand and document the impacts of the waste management system on environmental and social parameters the path forward the conference on waste management innovation and the subsequent seed grants resulted in a number of useful insights and recommendations which are summarized below based on circular economy principles urban and agricultural wastes can be repurposed as industrial resources there are a variety of proven methods and technologies available ranging from centralized waste collection and processing to decentralized applications that could function at a neighborhood or individual household scale circular economy advances will not only improve the resilience of urban and agricultural economies in the face of turbulent change but also will deliver benefits including climate mitigation food and water security enhanced biodiversity job creation and empowerment of underprivileged communities innovations in design and communication are
