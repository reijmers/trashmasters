5.1. Theoretical implications
This study makes a theoretical contribution by establishing the
concept of IoT-enabled accountability and its multiple dimensions.
From a systems perspective, a traceability service offers great
support to establish accountability. In the extant literature, most of
the traceability applications are associated with non-human ob-
jects. However, waste separation behaviour requires effort from
individuals as proper household waste separation is essential for
the achievement of a CE ( Stoeva and Alriksson, 2017 ). This is where
the accountability principle becomes important as it deals with
human participants and often incorporates rewards and penalties
to reshape behaviour. Although the importance of people ’s
behaviour is widely recognised ( Zhuang et al., 2008 ;Bernstad,
2014 ;Zhang and Wen, 2014b ), little research has investigated the
role of IoT in bringing about a behavioural change in a source
separation and CE context. This study advances the ﬁeld by moving
beyond IoT-enabled traceability to IoT-enabled accountability.
IoT-enabled accountability is not only useful for waste man-
agement, but for any contexts where it would be bene ﬁcial to hold
human participants accountable. For example, IoT has been used to
track the location and speed of automobile vehicles. Applications
can be developed for monitoring drivers, holding them accountable
for irresponsible driving behaviours. On a manufacturing shop
ﬂoor, IoT can be used to trace which workers perform certain pro-
cess steps. If defects and quality issues are a concern, accountability
applications can be developed for monitoring individual workers ’
quality performance. There is great potential for IoT technology
providers to market IoT-enabled accountability applications, and
future research can explore innovative marketing mechanisms.
The IoT-enabled source separation mechanism presented in thisresearch contributes to the rapidly-growing literature on smart
waste management. Smart waste management is a relatively new
concept ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) that offers a promising future but also
faces many challenges ( Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017 ). An IoT-
enabled source separation mechanism could overcome a major
challenge that is prevalent in many countries: speci ﬁcally, the
major obstacle to source separation posed by the culture and the
public ’s behaviours. This is in line with the ﬁndings of Zhang et al.
(2019) that a lack of environmental education and a culture that is
not oriented towards environmental protection is a key cause of
barriers to smart waste management for a CE in China.
5.2. Practical implications
The general propositions advanced from the case studies on IoT-
enabled accountability have extensive practical implications for
implementing source separation of waste. Propositions 2 e4 sug-
gest that IoT systems can enable the accountability of waste gen-
erators (residents) and waste collectors, as well as supporting and
enabling positive interaction between their respective account-
abilities. The case studies show that it is technically feasible to trace
the households which dispose of bagged rubbish in a residential
community and to hold them accountable for their waste disposal
behaviour. In the past, there lacked an ef ﬁcient means to identify
noncompliant citizens with regard to correct source separation of
household waste. However, the advancement of IoT technology
could be a game-changer to enforce accountability in household
waste source separation. Similarly, the IoT system enables the
accountability of waste collectors by providing real-time ﬁll rate
information to the waste management companies operating at the
backend. The data generated by the IoT system would not only be
useful in optimising the waste collection systems already in place,
the data could also be used to design the new source separation
projects as part of the nation-wide expansion of the proposed IoT-
enabled source separation program.
Theﬁfth proposition suggests that a combination of positive
(i.e., reward) and negative (i.e., punishment) incentives should be
applied to effectively and ef ﬁciently implement IoT-enabled source
separation. Employing a “positive ”or a “negative ”reinforcement
approach alone cannot fully achieve the desired outcome. For
example, Shanghai City in China recently started to enforce the very
stringent “Regulations on the Management of Household Waste ”from
the July 1, 2019. An individual may be ﬁned 50 to 200 RMB, and an
organisation may be ﬁned up to 50,000 RMB for an infringement of
the regulation. On the 1st July, 623 organisations were ﬁned in
Shanghai ( Xinhaunet, 2019 ). The determination of the Shanghai
government is commendable. However, the Shanghai government
faces the key challenge of identifying non-compliant citizens. The
long-term effectiveness of using punishment alone to enforce
source separation also remains questionable. In light of the case
study ﬁndings, an IoT-enabled HWM system can help to accurately
and ef ﬁciently identify non-compliant citizens. The researchers
recommend a combination of a “positive ”and “negative ”rein-
forcement approach in the early stages of implementing IoT-
enabled accountability, which is more likely to achieve a long
term and sustainable change in the waste disposal behaviours of
the public.
Lastly, the sixth proposition suggests that all the involved
stakeholders must cooperate to play their roles in order to sustain
the IoT-enabled source separation programme over the long term.

projects and promoting CE nationwide, the Chinese enforcement ofB. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773
