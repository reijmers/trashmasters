4.1. Comparison with other countries livestock waste to renewable energy 
generation policies to adopt circular economy 
Livestock manure-based biogas generation is growing gradually in 
Bangladesh, in comparison with countries like China, India, Nepal, 
Vietnam as reflected in Table 7. According to renewable energy statis -
tics, Germany is the leading country (6754 MW) globally for biogas- 
based electricity generation, and China (630 MW) is in the leading po-
sition in Asia [73]. That is why this study compared the livestock 
waste-based renewable energy generation policies of Bangladesh with 
Germany, China, and India as a neighboring country (Table 8). Though 
Bangladesh has a generic fiscal and tariff policy related to renewable 
energy as mentioned in Table 6, none is specific to biogas-based elec-
tricity generation. Subsidies are available at the household level ranging 
from US$60–250 for biogas plant construction. Varying amount of loan 
is also available with a 6–11% interest rate for a period of 3 months–7 
years (Table 8). 
While in Germany, the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) ensures the preferential purchase obligation, grid connection right, a guaranteed 
minimum feed-in tariff, and biogas upgrading bonus for renewable en-
ergy generation from livestock manure. Also, small farms in Germany 
can receive up to US$0.27/kWh electricity from biogas [74]. In China, 
there exists coherent law related to agriculture, animal husbandry, Table 5

Enabling environment of renewable energy development in Bangladesh.  
National 
strategies Examples Comments 
Regulatory 
regime National Energy Policy 
(NEP), 1996 It emphasized the exploration, and 
production of energy on a 
sustainable basis. 
Renewable Energy Policy of 
Bangladesh, 2002 Assigned the government agencies 
responsibilities to finance 
renewable energy and provide 
financial incentives in the form of 
income tax rebates to attract 
foreign investors. 
Renewable Energy Policy of 
Bangladesh, 2009 For the first time set a target of 5% 
renewable electricity generation 
by 2015, and 10% by 2020. 
Sustainable and Renewable 
Energy Development 
Authority Act, 2012 SREDA was formulated to 
coordinate countrywide 
renewable and renewable energy 
activities and projects. 
Power Sector Master Plan 
(PSMP), 2016 Proposed a comprehensive 
renewable energy development 
plan of 2470 MW by 2021, and 
3864 MW by 2041. 
Financial 
incentives Corporate Bonds Renewable energy companies can 
issue corporate bonds with the 
approval from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), 
Bangladesh [33,68]. 
Discounted share price To ensure a higher rate of return 
renewable energy companies can 
issue shares at a 10% discount 
price of its face value [69]. 
Power purchase Government power utility 
companies through mutually 
agreed Power Purchase 
Agreement (PPA) are obliged to 
purchase electricity from grid- 
connected renewable energy 
companies [70]. 
VAT benefits Renewable energy investors are 
exempted from customs duties up 
to 15% along with other charges 
like import permit fees for 
imported renewable energy 
equipment [69]. 
Electricity price The government will not regulate 
renewable electricity prices, 
rather it will be negotiated 
between renewable energy 
companies and government power 
utility companies [71]. 
Income Tax Renewable energy companies are 
allowed for 15 years corporate 
income tax rebate, and can claim 
100% depreciation in the first year 
(solar thermal, solar 
photovoltaic), and first five years 
(wind, small hydro, biomass, tidal, 
and geothermal) [33]. 
Tariff policy Solar rooftop and Green 
energy Any renewable energy projects up 
to 5 MW capacity or more can 
claim renewable energy tariffs. 
This allowed consumers to co- 
finance their electricity bills [72]. 
Net Energy Metering Consumers and producers can 
connect the renewable energy 
system to the national grid based 
on drafted net energy metering 
guidelines (2017) [71].
