Plastic packaging has a short lifetime, which generates a large amount of waste. However, robust information on plastic packaging waste ﬂow is generally not available, especially for developing countries such as Brazil. Weanalyzed and quantiﬁed Brazilian post-consumer plastic packaging waste  ﬂows using materialﬂow analysis  for the year 2017. The system modeled covered from the manufacturing stage of plastic packaging up to its waste management stage. We used a range of data sources, whose quality we assessed using uncertainty characterization. The results showed that Brazil generated 12 Mt ofPPW in 2017, and the management of 63% of that was not monitored. The majority of monitored PPW was disposed of into landﬁlls, but 0.8 Mt of PPW was improperly disposed. Informal collection was 24% greater than formally managed selective collection. Only 4.5% of the PPW generated in Brazil wasrecycled. The results identiﬁed the major national challenges in relation to PPW management as being that information systems needed to be improved, informal waste collectors needed to be socially and productively included in the management systems, and recovery systems needed to be developedtowards a circular economy. /C2112021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 1. Introduction Large-scale production and use of plastic have increased expo- nentially since the 1950s .Geyer et al.  estimated that 8,300 Mt of plastics were produced worldwide from 1950 to 2015. The packaging industry is the sector that consumes most plastic polymers; in 2015, 40% of plastic polymers worldwide were used for packaging production . As a result, plastic waste generation has grown worldwide. In 1960, the plastic share in municipal solid waste  in high- and middle-income countries was less than 1% and it rose to over 10% by 2005 . Plastic waste is of particular concern, as the scientiﬁc commu- nity has reported several adverse effects on human health and on the environment caused by plastics. Moreover, plastic pollution in marine and freshwater environments has emerged as a global issue . Hence, proper managementof plastic waste could contribute to reducing its environmental impacts . In high-income countries, plastic recycling has increased due to legislative and economic instruments . Indeed, in 2015, the European Union adopted an action plan for a circular economy in which prioritize strategies for managing plastic pack- aging . However, until 2015, only 9% of all plastics ever made worldwide were recycled ( Geyer et al., 2017 ). In developing countries, in particular, recycling rates are far below their potential. In Brazil, according to the National Sanita- tion Information System  , only 1.65% of the MSW collected in 2017 was recovered through recy- cling. The Brazilian National Policy on Solid Waste (PNRS, in Por- tuguese) of 2010 established that all recyclable solid waste should be recovered and only non-recyclable solid waste could be disposed of in landﬁlls . The PNRS established the principle of shared responsibility on waste management among supply chain actors . The policy obliged manufacturers, importers, distributors, and traders of sev- eral types of products to implement reverse logistics ( Ribeiro and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.04.005 0956-053X/ /C2112021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.⇑Corresponding author at: Departamento de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, SC CEP 88.040-900, Brazil.

Kruglianskas, 2020 ), including plastic packaging. Thus, the gov- ernment established a Packaging Sector Agreement to promote the packaging reverse logistic as an instrument of the PNRS  . Furthermore, informal waste collectors, called ”waste pickers”, are responsible for most of the recycling in low-income countries, achieving recycling rates of 20% to 30% for MSW . Therefore, MSW management in Brazil is a complex task because, in addition to economic and environmental aspects, there is also the socio-economic aspect represented by the waste pickers’ work within the collection, classiﬁcation and commercialization of recyclable waste , such as post-consumer packaging plastic waste . Federal Government and some State Governments during the ﬁrst decade of this century pro- moted the socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers, by enforc-ing legislation and ﬁnancing socio-economic inclusive programs for waste pickers. Even tough, society tends to neglect these professionals. Material ﬂow analysis  is a relevant tool for plastic waste management analysis, since it provides a systematic assessment of the state of and changes in material ﬂows within a system deﬁned in space and time ( Brunner and Rechberger, 2004 ).Allesch et al.  reviewed the application of MFA in waste management and their results showed that MFA is instru- mental in understanding how waste management systems work. Thus, several studies on MFAs for solid waste and for plastics products have been conducted for developed countries (Bogucka et al., 2008; Brouwer et al., 2018; Deshpande et al., 2020; Eygen et al., 2017; Eygen et al., 2018; Kawecki et al., 2018 ). Despite its relevance, MFA has not been widely applied in low- and middle-income countries. Applying MFA in developing countries can be challenging due to limited data ( Millette et al., 2019 ). However, Vilaysouk et al.  measured material inputs and outﬂows of waste and emissions for Laos. Kabera et al.  realized a mass-ﬂow diagram of MSW for Kigali in Rwanda, and Makarichi et al.  performed an MFA on solid waste for Zimbabwe. Millette et al.  conducted an MFA of plastics for Trinidad and Tobago. Performing MFAs using currently available data could also support the development of a circular economy within a developing country ( Millette et al., 2019 ). In Brazil, a key consideration for managers and researchers when analyzing MSW systems is data availability, because infor- mation is lacking . Even so, plastic waste management has been studied already for Brazil. Pacheco et al.  measured the plastic recycling capacity of Rio de Janeiro. Rutkowski and Rutkowski  analyzed Brazilian recycling chains for plastics by visiting waste pickers’ associations. Coelho et al.  analyzed logistics models for post-consumer PET recy- cling for Brazil. Oliveira et al.  investigated the supply chain and reverse channels of polystyrene  packaging in Brazil and pointed to the main challenges facing a move towards a circular economy. However, MFA has not yet been used for analyzing PPW ﬂows in Brazil. Therefore, the question that the present study aims to answer is ‘‘What was the PPW management ﬂow system like in Brazil, in 2017, and what barriers and opportunities are there to improving it?” Further to that, we ask ‘‘What role did the informal waste sec- tor play?” The study aims to analyze the challenges the country would face in reaching a more circular production of PPW consid- ering the socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers. This study is the ﬁrst MFA for PPW in Brazil and provides an estimate of previ- ously unknown ﬂows: the informal collection of PPW, the PPW tailing in sorting units, and the non-monitored management of PPW.2. Method A static MFA of PPW was realized for Brazil in 2017 to analyze the PPW management in the country. We identiﬁed and syn- thetized disperse data on PPW management in Brazil. Firstly, we collected information from existing databases, then, we compiled the information to represent the input values of the ﬂows. The MFA was performed by balancing the system and calculating the ﬂows’ output values. 2.1. System description The MFA studied PPW, which is MSW; industrial waste was not considered and PPW polymeric composition was not analyzed. Plastic product chains comprise three main stages — the pro- duction, consumption, and waste management ( Eygen et al., 2017 ). The qualitative model of PPW management in Brazil is pre- sented in Support Information S1. In the production stage, plastic packaging is manufactured; the MFA system does not consider the primary production of plastics. Further on, plastic packaging is sold by the manufacturing industry for consumption. In addition, Brazilian imports and exports of plas- tic packaging are regarded as plastic packaging delivered for consumption. After plastic packaging is used, it is discharged as MSW and referred to as PPW. In Brazil, MSW covers urban cleaning waste, household waste, and commercial solid waste similar to household waste in nature, composition, and volume . In Brazil, irregular disposal of MSW is a main concern . Thus, we counted a PPW ﬂow that its management is not monitored, so the ﬂow represents the material that is managed but not mon- itored and the mismanaged material, that could have leaked out of the system. The Brazilian PPW collection system was observed in terms of three main categories — mixed collection, selective collection, and informal collection. Mixed collection is unsorted MSW sent for disposal ( Cunha and Caixeta Filho, 2002 ) as general waste in landﬁlls, controlled dump- sites, or dumpsites . While landﬁll is technically designed and monitored, dumpsites are not. The controlled dump- sites receive a layer of soil . The mixed col- lection of PPW is undertaken by public agencies, private agencies, and other agents such as philanthropic entities and large solid waste generators . Selective collection is only of dry recyclable waste. Selective col- lection in Brazil is undertaken by public agencies, private agencies,and waste pickers associations or cooperatives with formal agree- ment or contract with municipalities . Informal collection is the non-regulated activity of extraction of recyclable materials, such as PPW, from mixed MSW ( Ezeah et al., 2013 ) or segregated material that is given directly to waste pickers without municipalities control. The informal sector recycling net- work is composed of household waste collectors, street pickers, itinerant waste buyers, MSW collection crews, dumpsite pickers, intermediate dealers  and waste pickers associ- ation or cooperatives. Collected PPW is transported to sorting units, for sorting, press- ing, baling, and trading of recyclable waste to recycling centers . A variable percentage of PPW is unﬁtted for recycling and discharged as tailing. Some PPW is recy- cled for the manufacture of new packaging and some is recycled for non-packaging applications . Incineration was not examined because this technology is not used for MSW treatment in Brazil .I. Pimentel Pincelli, A. Borges de Castilhos Júnior, M. Seleme Matias et al. Waste Management 126  781–790 782 2.2. Data collection and compilation We collected data on PPW management in Brazil from existing data sources, mostly ofﬁcial Brazilian government databases. A description of the data sources is presented in Table S2.1 and a summary of all data utilized for each input ﬂow is provided in Table S2.2 , however, we did not have pre- viously information about the informal collection of PPW, the PPW tailing sorting units, and the non-monitored management of PPW . As speciﬁc data on PPW are scarce in Brazil, we com- bined information for estimating MFA input ﬂows. Support Infor- mation S7 summarizes the data sources and data compilation for all the input ﬂows. The data on plastic packaging mass production and industrial sales in 2017 were taken from the annual industrial survey of theBrazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics  ( IBGE, 2017a,b ). The masses compositions of plastic packaging manufac- turing and industrial sales are presented in Fig. 1 . More informa- tion about plastic packaging categories manufactured and sold industrially is presented in Support information S3. Data on importing and exporting plastic packaging were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Economy Industry, Foreign Trade and Services  database. Calculation procedures were needed for estimating the follow- ing input ﬂows: the generation of PPW; the selective collection of PPW; and the mixed collection of PPW. The estimation of the generation of PPW was based on Geyer et al.  procedure by combining plastic packaging production data with plastic packaging lifetime. Additionally, the amount of plastic packaging imported and exported was considered. The life- time of plastic packaging is estimated as 1 year ( Ciacci et al., 2017; Kuczenski and Geyer, 2010; Patel et al., 1998 ) and its mean lifetime is 0.5 year . Thus, we estimated that half of the plastic packaging that became waste in 2017 was manufactured in 2016 and half in 2017. That formula is shown in , in which PPW denotes the mass  of plastic packaging waste generated, P denotes the mass  of plastic packaging produced, and Iand E, the mass  of plastic packaging imported and exported. The results of the input ﬂow of PPW generation are presented in Sup- port Information S4. PPW ð2017Þ¼0:5ðPð2017ÞþPð2016ÞþIð2017ÞþIð2016Þ/C0E2017ðÞ /C0E2016ðÞÞð 1ÞTo establish the amount of PPW collected by selective and mixed collection, we ﬁrstly estimated the MSW collected by selec- tive and mixed collection, followed by the proportion of plastic packaging in the MSW. For MSW collection information, data were taken from the SNIS  . The SNIS research is the only national research on solid waste with available dataset for the 2017 year. However, munici- palities’ participation in the survey is voluntary and not all of them participated . Therefore, information on MSW man- agement for the unreported municipalities was estimated. Brazilian databases present the total amount of MSW collected in Brazil, which includes that from selective collection. Therefore, data about MSW collected by mixed collection were extracted from the SNIS  database by deducting the amount collected selectively by each agent for each municipality. In this way, dataon mixed MSW collected masses were compiled for 60% of the Brazilian municipalities. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to project the MSW collected by mixed collection for the unreported municipalities. The general expression of multiple regression is shown in Formula below, in which ydenotes the predicted variable, adenotes a constant, bdenotes the regression coefﬁcients, and /C2denotes the independent variables. Municipal urban population  and municipal GDP were used as independent variables . y¼aþb1x1þb2x2þ:::þbnxn ð2Þ The SNIS dataset  was used to extract information on the amount of MSW collected by each of the mixed collection agents. We collected information on the amount of MSW deposited in landﬁll, dumpsites, and controlled dumpsites from the SNIS report . Information about municipalities running selective collection services was extracted from SNIS  and IBGE  . A total of 63.8% of the Brazilian municipalities informed SNIS whether they run selective collection services. The information for the others 36,2% was collected from IBGE  , although related to 2010, it allowed a Brazilian overview. A total of 1771 municipali- ties were provided, in 2017, with ofﬁcial selective collection, repre- senting 33% of Brazilian municipalities and 63% of population. TheSNIS  provided data on the selective collection mass of MSW for 70% of the Brazilian municipalities identiﬁed with selective collection services. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to project the selectively collected MSW masses for the Fig. 1. Plastic packaging produced and sold by industries in Brazil in 2017 .I. Pimentel Pincelli, A. Borges de Castilhos Júnior, M. Seleme Matias et al. Waste Management 126  781–790 783 unreported municipalities on the SNIS database. Municipal gross domestic product   and the human development index   were used as independent variables for projecting selective collection masses. The SNIS  report presented a proportional rate of MSW selectively collected by public agencies, private agencies, and for- mal waste picker organizations. Thus, we determined transfer coef- ﬁcients for each agency who undertook the selective collection by extracting their respective rate information from the SNIS  report. After calculating the masses of MSW collections, we estimated the proportion of plastic packaging in the MSW. For the proportion of plastic from selective collection, the SNIS  information was taken from 2017 as published in its report. For the proportion of plastic from mixed collection, information was taken from IPEA  study, which is the only national research on Brazilian MSW composition. The proportion of plastic waste that is packaging in selective and mixed collections was expressed by Geyer et al.’s  worldwide estimate, because there are no Brazilian studies about the levels of PPW in MSW. Finally, the mass of PPW which was recycled was obtained from the Technical Report of the Brazilian Sectoral Agreement for the implementation of reverse logistics of general packaging ( SINIR, 2017 ). Data on manufacturing new products by recycling PPW was extracted from the Brazilian PET Industry Association ( ABIPET, 2016 ) report, which referred to PET products. The report presents the breakdown of ﬁnal uses of recycled PET in Brazil in 2016. The rates of PPW recycled for new plastic packaging and for non- packaging applications were extracted from this report and used as a transfer coefﬁcient in the MFA system. 2.3. Data quality Data availability to quantify material ﬂows is often limited, owing to data scarcity or missing data . Data used for MFA are interdisciplinary, have heterogeneous sources, and may vary on formats and qualities . There- fore, assessing the reliability of the ﬂows provides the quantiﬁca- tion of the data limitations for system understanding. The quality of the data sources was assessed using the uncer- tainty characterization method developed by Laner et al.  . The approach was developed to include data quality indicators within the pedigree matrix presented by Weidema and Wesn æs  , combined with the quantiﬁcation of uncertainty based on data source classiﬁcation as proposed by Hedbrant and Sörme  . Firstly, data quality of all MFA input ﬂows was evaluated by data quality indicator scores , presented in Support Information S8. These indicators encompass the geograph- ical and temporal representativeness, the investigated material, and the completeness and reliability of the source ( Sieber et al., 2020 ). The assigned scores for each information source are pre- sented in Support Information S10. These various data quality indicators were translated into uncertainty by coefﬁcients of variation  ( Muchangos et al., 2019 ). Uncertainty was assumed to increase exponentially with poor data quality . Data uncertainty was assumed to be normally distributed, because of its mathematical convenience . These assumptions have also been made by Muchangos et al. , Eygen et al. , Tran et al. , Makarichi et al.  , and Warrings and Fellner  while executing Laner et al.  approach. The CVs are the stan- dard deviation divided by the mean . The detailed procedure for the CV calculation is shown in the Support Information S9.2.4. MFa The input ﬂows that we used to perform the MFA are summa- rized in Support Information S7. We used the previously calculated CVs as input uncertainty values for the input ﬂows (Support Infor- mation S11). MFA is based on the law of conservation of matter within the system and all its processes . The ﬂows are calculated by using a material balance to compare the mass of all ﬂows entering, leaving, and stocked at a process . Therefore, the mass of all ﬂows entering a pro- cess must equal the mass of ﬂows leaving this process plus the stock change . Support Information S12 pre- sents the mass balance equations. Using this procedure, unknown ﬂows can be calculated by balancing the system ( Eygen et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the previously unknown ﬂows of the system — the informal collection of PPW, the PPW tailing in sorting units, and the amount of non-monitored PPW— were estimated by the MFA . We used STAN 2.6 software, developed by Tu Wien, to perform the MFA and for data visualization through a Sankey diagram, in which the thickness of the ﬂows was proportional to their value . We used STAN to reconcile data and to perform error propagation. STAN is a free software that has been used widely in the scientiﬁc literature for several MFAs, such as the studies performed by Boh and Clark , Tazi et al.  and Brouwer et al.  . Input redundant information are used to reconcile the MFA input data . The method of least squares is used for data reconciliation, in which uncertainties are used as weighing factors . By data reconciliation, we calculated the values for the MFA output ﬂows – with previous information. Subsequentially, the reconciled values were used to calculate previously unknown ﬂows ( Cencic and Rechberger, 2008 ) by balancing the system. STAN presents a data reconciliation quality  indicator , which expresses the difference between 1 and the mean value of measurement adjustments per maximum allowed adjustment. DQR ranges from 0 to 1 , and DQR close to 1 indicates that the reconciled data matched the orig- inal data well . 3. Results and discussion Firstly, we present the results for the projections of the selec- tive and mixed collections of MSW. Subsequently, we show the input data quality uncertainty of the MFA input ﬂows. Finally, we display the PPW modeled system and the values of the out- puts ﬂows. 3.1. MSW collections projections There were 1,771 municipalities served by a selective collec- tion service in Brazil, accounting for 32% of all Brazilian munici- palities. The SNIS  database lacked information on selective collection mass for 536 of these municipalities, which had their mass estimated by linear regression. The multiple linear regression equation, established to predict the mass of selectively collected MSW in Brazil in 2017, is shown in Formula ,i n which SCM is the selective collection mass . This regression model explains 36% of the original variability . The regression residuals follow the normal distribution ( Figure S5.1 and Figure S5.2 ).

Waste Management 126  781–790 784 By projecting the selective collection mass for the unreported municipalities in the SNIS  database, the mass of selectively collected MSW in Brazil in 2017 was estimated as 1.87 Mt . The analysis of the SNIS  dataset revealed the MSW mass collected by mixed collection in 2017 for 3,366 municipali- ties. The mass for the remaining 2,204 was projected by linear regression. The linear regression equation established to predict the mixed MSW collection mass is shown in Formula , in which MCM is the mixed collection mass . The modeled regression explains 85% of the original variation  and its residuals approximate to the normal distribution ( Figure S6.1 and Figure S6.2 ). MCM ¼10ð/C00:84þ0:57log10UPþ0:11log10GPDÞð4Þ The mixed collection of MSW was projected for the unreported municipalities in the  database. Hence, the mixed col- lection of MSW in Brazil in 2017 was estimated as 58.16 Mt . 3.2. Input CVs We present the assessment of the data quality uncertainties for the input ﬂows in Fig. 2 , which shows the CV results corresponding to the input ﬂow. As a general trend, data uncertainties were lower for the plastic packaging production and consumption stages (F1, F2, F3 and F4), and they increased for the solid waste management stage. This trend was expected, as usually databases used for MFA are more inefﬁcient when moving downstream in the system . Detailed information on the input ﬂows quantities and their CVs are provided in Support Information S11. Overall, quality of information on PPW management was quite poor. Hence, Brazil needs to improve the information systems, and information should be rigorously controlled by regulatorycertiﬁcations. Complementary to improving information systems, scientiﬁc ﬁeld investigations could be a valuable tool for checking the data in the ﬁeld and improving information quality. On the other hand, carrying out ﬁeld investigation could be challenging because Brazil has continental dimensions. 3.3. PPW ﬂow analysis Balancing the system and reconciling the data resulted in the MFA modeled . The results present an overview of Brazilian PPW waste management, identifying its general patterns. The system of equations was overdetermined and data were reconciled. The mixed collection of PPW ﬂow and the ﬁnal disposal ﬂows had their data reconciled . The smaller the deviation of an output ﬂow value, after data reconcili- ation, from the input value, the better the consistency of the input data given the balance constraints of the model ( Klingmair et al., 2016 ). The STAN indicator of DQR was 0.95, which indicated that the reconciled data matched the input data well, so the system modeled is consistent.The main outcome of this study was the proposed model for the PPW ﬂows for Brazil in 2017. Information not available in the country, such as the amount of PPW informally collected, wereestimated. Most of the PPW generated was not monitored. The PPW recycling rate in the country was far below its potential, and informal collection was superior to the formal selective collection. 3.3.1. Plastic packaging manufacture, sale, and consumption Plastic packaging products consumed in 2017 were mostly manufactured within the country, around 1% was imported. A total of 13.9 Mt of plastic packaging was manufactured and 13.3 Mt was sold industrially. In 2015, 146 Mt of plastic packaging was manufactured world- wide . Our results present that 13.9 Mt of plastic packaging was manufactured in Brazil; thus, the country makes around 9% of the global production of plastic packaging. Plastic lids and unspeciﬁed plastic pieces for packaging consti- tute the greatest proportion of plastic packaging mass manufac-tured in Brazil . However, the deﬁnition of plastic packaging varies worldwide. For example, in this study, plastic trash bags and plastic bags were regarded as plastic packaging, as referred to in the Brazilian National Classiﬁcation of Economic Activities  and Mercosur Common Nomenclature . While the EPA  did not consider plastic trash bags for United States PPW analysis, plastic bags were included in Brouwer et al.’s  study and in the European Union’s  deﬁnition of plas- tic packaging waste. On the other hand, the data of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of The Netherlands consid- ered plastic bags as a non-packaging object . Therefore, national databases have their own singularities when deﬁning plastic packaging. Moreover, quantitatively comparing studies on the ﬂows and processes of plastic packaging in other countries and time periods is difﬁcult, as scopes regarding materi- als and processes may differ across the studies . 3.3.2. PPW generation Brazilian PPW generation is estimated at 12 Mt. And Brazil‘s per capita generation of PPW was 58 kg, similar to South Korea. Jang et al.  found that South Korea was the largest per capita PPW generator, when compared to the rate in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Japan, and Belgium, thus, Brazil joined South Kor- ea’s position. The Brazilian Packaging Sector Agreement reported that in 2017 around 8 Mt of plastic waste was generated in Brazil , which differs from the results of the present study, which used a different procedure method. The Sector Agreement approach was based on the amount of collected solid waste, considering the plas- tic packaging manufacturing variation rate . In the present study, generation was based on the amount of plastic pack- aging manufactured, imported, and exported, considering itsTable 1 Amount of plastic packaging collected by selective and mixed collection in Brazil in2017 calculated as input information for the MFA.

As Brazilian information systems do not monitor PPW generation, distinct approaches could lead to different results for their mass generation. This situation was noted in other countries, comparing three studies of MFA for plastics in Austria; their results for plastic waste generated showed signiﬁcant differences, which were attributed to the use of different methods and sources for data collection ( Eygen et al., 2017 ). 3.3.3. Non-monitored PPW The management of almost 62% of the generated PPW was not monitored. Brazil needs to improve solid waste governance and information systems. Part of the non-monitored PPW could have been mismanaged and leaked to the environment. Only 30% to 70% of solid waste generated in developing countries’ urban centers is collected, and the uncollected waste may be dumped or thrown on the streets and into water bodies ( Ezeah et al., 2013 ). The irregular discharge of PPW is a direct source of environ- mental pollution. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, McKinsey & Company, and the World Economic Forum  , 32% of plastic packaging waste leaks out of the collection system worldwide; either it is not collected at all, or it is collected but mis- managed. Globally, 6.2 Mt of macro plastic was lost to the environ- ment in 2015, and the major source of plastic loss is the mismanaged MSW in low-income and lower-middle-income coun- tries , mainly in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East, where there is a high level of plas- tic consumption as well as a large proportion of inadequately man- aged MSW . When PPW is transported to water bodies, plastic debris accu- mulates in the oceans, becoming a borderless issue. 80% of ocean plastic pollution is originated in a terrestrial environment. Improving plastic waste management could prevent plastic waste entering the ocean from land ( Jambeck et al., 2015 ).Jambeck et al.’s  study estimated that the Brazilian contribution to plastic waste in oceans in 2010 was up to 1 Mt. The large amount of non-monitored PPW in Brazil is alarming for unable the environmental pollution evaluation. 3.3.4. Mixed collection of PPW and disposal Eighty-ﬁve percent of the PPW was collected by mixed collec- tion, and disposed of in landﬁlls, controlled dumpsites and dump- sites. Most of the mixed collection was performed by public or private agencies, and private agencies collected about 44% more than the public ones. Mixed collection of PPW was llarger than selective and informal collection together, which presented a proﬁle for the country stillbased on a linear economy. Although the PNRS regulated that recy- clable solid waste, such as PPW, should be recycled , most of the collected PPW was disposed of, mostly in landﬁlls. Eighty percent of the disposal of PPW was in landﬁlls. However, about 0.8 Mt of PPW was disposed of in environmentally inappro- priate sites — dumpsites or controlled dumpsites. Thus, Brazil still faces the challenge of closing its dumpsites. A few dumps have been closed, and many of them continue to operate informally . Closed dumps are rarely recovered; most of them are land covered and abandoned . Cur- rent improper waste management in Brazil causes environmental and human health impacts, through surface and groundwater con- tamination and air quality deterioration, contributing to climate change . Disposing plastic waste in landﬁll can contaminate soil and groundwater due to plastic leaching, therefore landﬁlling PPW might be considered a short-term solution ( Shen et al., 2020; Teuten et al., 2009 ).Globally, 12% of plastic waste was incinerated and 79% was accumulated in landﬁlls or the natural environment between 1950 and 2015 . In 2020, Austria plastic waste ﬂow analysis showed that 67% was incinerated and 2%, landﬁlled . In South Korea, 11% of PPW was landﬁlled, 38.5%, incinerated without energy recovery, and 37%, incinerated with energy recovery . In Brazil, so far incinera- tion is not a viable option, there are some recent attempts to pro- duce refuse derived fuel . 3.3.5. Selective and informal collections of PPW Informal collection was about 24% greater than formal selective collection. Private agencies performed most of the selective collec- tion, followed by formal waste picker organizations, and ﬁnally by public agencies. Informal collection of PPW was higher than selective collection and demonstrated the relevance of the waste pickers’ work. Other studies around the world also pointed out that the material collec- tion rate from informal collection was higher than from formal col- lection . Informal waste pickers’ sanitation and environmental services are often not recognized . Whereas the formal sector is modern, industrialized, and legally backed by government agen- cies, the informal sector lies out of state control . In Brazil, informal waste pickers are marginalized people who work collecting recyclable waste. They work in unhealthy and pre- carious conditions . Informal material recov- ery facilities have little or no institutional control, they often do not meet legal or technical requirements or have adequate infrastruc- ture , which contributes to an unhealthy and unsafe work environment. Indeed, 36% of the selective collection of PPW was performed by formalized waste picker organizations, denoting their inclusion on this service. 3.3.6. PPW recovery In sorting units, 20% of the PPW was discharged, because it was unsortable or unsorted. PPW are unsortable when it does not meet the standard quality of the recycling centers. The quality of the materials in sorting units depends on household separation ,Fidelis et al.  noted organic waste arriving to sorting units in Brazil. The quality of the material also depends on collection, compacting trucks damage the material ( Gutberlet, 2015 ). Furthermore, sorting processes also have capacity limitation . After the sorting process, PPW is sent to recycling factories. However, only 0.5 Mt of PPW was recycled. Thus, only about 4.5% of the generated PPW in Brazil was recycled in 2017, whichshowed poor material efﬁciency. Recycling of PPW was quite low in Brazil in 2017. Compared with the Sectoral Agreement for Packaging estimation of the Brazilian plastic recycling rate , the results of this study are much lower. That is because SINIR’s  estimation was related to the recycling of collected rather than generated solid waste. Almost 44% of plastic packaging was recycled in Italy ( Lombardi et al., 2021 ). In Austria, 31% of plastic waste was recycled in 2010  and in The Netherlands 30% of PPW was recy- cled in 2014 . South Korea recycled 13,5% of PPW in 2017. The recycling rates in The Netherlands and Austria were much higher than in Brazil. Worldwide, recycling of plastic materials is quite low, according to Geyer et al.  ; only 9% of all plastic material ever produced has been recycled, and only 10% of that has been recycled more than once. Recycling improve the material efﬁciency, most recycled PPW was used for non-packaging applications and was reinserted intoI. Pimentel Pincelli, A. Borges de Castilhos Júnior, M. Seleme Matias et al. Waste Management 126  781–790 787 other production systems. A limitation of the present study is the use of data on PET packaging  to portray the use of recycled PPW of all polymer types. Brouwer et al.  pointed out that, in the Netherlands, most packaging manufactured from recycled PPW was PET. Indeed, the quality uncertainty for the ﬂow of packaging made by recycled PPW was high  . There- fore, developing resource and solid waste management informa- tion systems could lead to more accurate ﬂow analysis. 3.4. Challenges towards a circular economy The analysis of PPW in Brazil revealed the challenges faced by the country to introduce a more circular productive system for the plastic packaging chain, attending to the socioproductive inclu- sion of waste pickers. The circular economy could improve solid waste management by boosting developing economies through the principles of waste valorization and recycling . The implemen- tation of a circular economy depends on redesigning the manage- ment system involving all reverse and supply chain actors ( Oliveira et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Brazilian policies on solid waste meet the principles of a circular economy . The Brazilian challenges to promote circular economy are of various kinds — from improving the quality of the information sys- tem to the socio-productive inclusion of waste pickers, through an effective selective collection policy, preferably in solidarity. The PPW information systems need to be improved, because most of the PPW generated was not monitored. Indeed, the PNRS has foreseen the National Solid Waste Management Information System  . The Packaging Sector Agreement forecast partnerships with the SINISA for evaluating packaging reverse logistics in the country . Moreover, the Sector Agreement proposed a partnership with the National Association of Waste Pickers  for generating information on packaging waste managed by waste pickers . Neither of these information systems has yet been implemented in Brazil, but they are expected to be installed soon . Munici- palities need to improve their administration, especially the smal- ler ones and the ones located in the less developed regions of Brazil . Furthermore, some municipalities have struc- tural deﬁciencies, they do not have e-mail, internet access or com- puter, which complicate the circulation of information on solid waste management . PPW generation originates from plastic products used on a daily basis. Therefore, a drastic change in consumption by society could reduce PPW generation, which is challenging because con- sumerism is highly evident across the world ( Andrades et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, solid waste generation could be reduced by the transition towards a circular economy, in which waste man- agement and resource management are addressed together and products are designed to prevent waste generation. Brazil needs to promote more effective recycling of PPW, as the present study showed a great potential for the recycling industry. Waste pickers work must be formalized and endorsed to improve the recycling. The need to integrate existing informal recycling sys- tems into formal solid waste management was indicated in several studies ( Ezeah et al., 2013; Ibáñez-Foréz et al., 2018; Yıldız-Geyhan et al., 2019 ).Ferronato et al.  pointed out that the ﬁrst strat- egy to introduce a circular economy within developing countries is the formalization of waste pickers. Therefore, solid waste strate- gies should incorporate informal waste pickers into the formal management process . To address waste pickers’ marginalization, Brazilian policies have the inclusion of waste pickers as a priority when regarding solid waste management . Thus, Brazilian poli- cies were created for reaching sustainably towards a circular econ-omy  and a solidarity economy. Municipalities can contract their services without bidding process as promulgated by PNRS. The Brazilian Packaging Sector Agree- ment has undertaken actions to formalize waste pickers in work associations or cooperatives to drive implementation of packaging reverse logistics in the country . Actually, Rutkowski and Rutkowski  considered Brazilian waste pickers inclusive recycling practices were among global best practice for informal sector integration. Despite advances to address waste pickers’ marginalization in Brazil, the reality has not yet fulﬁlled the principle; the informal sector is responsible for most PPW collection for recycling. There- fore, inclusive recycling practices still need to be expanded throughout the country. Effective investments and public aware- ness are needed to improve solid waste management alongsidewaste picker inclusion. 4. Conclusion MFA is an approach worldwide used to assist solid waste man- agement. Applying MFA for PPW management in Brazil for the year 2017 was challenging because of limitation of data availability. Indeed, the information data quality was assessed. Almost two-thirds of the PPW generated was not monitored. Most of the collected PPW was disposed of, describing a linear pro- duction system. Informal collection was superior to selective col- lection, which shows the relevance of the waste pickers service. A relevant strategy for Brazil to move towards a circular economy is based on promoting an effective socioproductive inclusion of waste pickers. Thus, we can count on a more efﬁcient and effective PPW recycling with a more accurate data collection. We may even be able to propose a decrease in the production of some types of plastics.
