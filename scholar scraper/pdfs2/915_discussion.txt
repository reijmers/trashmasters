Although it is not the only existing circularity indicator, it can undoubtedly be said
that the “material circularity indicator” is one of the most robust tools for assessing the
CE, and since the development of the original methodology published in 2015 by the
EMF, the similarities between life cycle assessment and material circularity indicator
have become evident. Both methodologies use system boundaries that encompass all
