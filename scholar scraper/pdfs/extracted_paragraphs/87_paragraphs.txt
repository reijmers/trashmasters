Tel.: +33 3 87 37 54 30; E-mail address:  paul.stief@ensam.eu Abstract  In today’s business environment, the trend towards more product variety and customization is unbroken. Due to this development, the need of  agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families. To design and optimize production systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches, product analysis methods are needed. Indeed, most of the known methods aim to  analyze a product or one product family on the physical level. Different product families, however, may differ largely in terms of the number and  nature of components. This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the productionsystem. A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture. The aim is to cluster these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable  assembly systems. Based on Datum Flow Chain, the physical structure of the products is analyzed. Functional subassemblies are identified, and a functional analysis is performed. Moreover, a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph  is the output which depicts the  similarity between product families by providing design support to both, production system planners and product designers. An illustrative example of a nail-clipper is used to explain the proposed methodology. An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of  thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach.  © 2017 The Authors.

Introduction  Due to the fast development in the domain of  communication and an ongoing trend of digitization and digitalization, manufacturing enterprises are facing importantchallenges in today’s market environments: a continuingtendency towards reduction of product development times andshortened product lifecycles. In addition, there is an increasingdemand of customization, being at the same time in a global competition with competitors all over the world. This trend, which is inducing the development from macro to micro markets, results in diminished lot sizes due to augmenting product varieties  .  To cope with this augmenting variety as well as to be able toidentify possible optimization potentials in the existing production system, it is important to have a precise knowledgeof the product range and characteristics manufactured and/or assembled in this system. In this context, the main challenge inmodelling and analysis is now not only to cope with single  products, a limited product range or existing product families,but also to be able to analyze and to compare products to define new product families. It can be observed that classical existing product families are regrouped in function of clients or features. However, assembly oriented product families are hardly to find.  On the product family level, products differ mainly in two main characteristics:  the number of components and  thetype of components .  Classical methodologies considering mainly single products  or solitary, already existing product families analyze the product structure on a physical level  which  causes difficulties regarding an efficient definition andcomparison of different product families.

It is high time that we must  make some changes in the way plastic products are being  used.     The Circular Economy brought a revolutionary change for  plastic waste management. Circular Economy emphasizes on  zero waste methodology by innova tion and rethinking design to  increase product life cycle for better use and less frequent  waste,  reusability,  and recyclability  in all ways  possible  so that  the waste would not end up in landfills or marine litter. The  World Economic Forum also introduced  The New Plastic  economy which pointed out how plastic rethinking and  redesigning will make major implications (World Economic  Forum, 2016). Europe has also signed the Plastic Pack which  aims to make plastic life circular for better tomorrow ( Plastic  The F acts, 2017) .    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is devoted to the literature review  and plastic  and their types  are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on the generation  and wastage of plastic industry wise. Section 5 proposes our model for Circular Economy in plastics used in Packaging Industries. Section 6 supports the model by creating an AHP  model to identify the best plastic waste collection method we should employ for achieving Circular Economy. Section 7  presents a case study of Circular Economy used to convert  waste plastic in high grade  fuel.    2. Literature  Review     A literature review has been done on the circular economy,  plastic waste management and circular economy of plastics on  search engines like Springer, Taylor and Francis online,  Emerald Insight and from Google  scholars. Several general  articles  and videos  illustrating  the concepts of plastic  waste and  how circular economy can help reduce them are being studied.   pointed out the assumptions and  action plans for making the Circular Economy plan work for Plastics based on the European Commission’s plan introduced  in 2015.   Performance indicators have been developed for assessing  the Circular  Economy  of bioplastics  and how they can be more  beneficial than conventional plastics (Spierling S.,  Venkatachalam V., Behnsen H., Herrmann C., Endres HJ.  2019). Effects of Black Plastic    on the environment and on marine life  are very  severe  as they  contain hazardous chemicals. Waste Electronic and Electrical  Equipment  also produces black plastics (Andrew  Turner, 2018). Recycl ed plastic products must pass certain   tests and criteria  chemically  to be declared  as fit for use for  foods and  drinks   .  (Burlakovs,  J.; Kriipsalu,  M.; Porshnov,  D.; Jani,  Y.; Ozols,  V.; Pehme, K. -M.; Rudovica, V.; Grinfelde, I.; Pilecka,  J.; Vincevica -Gaile, Z.; Turkadze, T.; Hogland, W.;  Klavins,2019) Shared the challenges, concerns, and solutions  for plastic waste treatment. They introduced  Thermogravimetry for plastic waste decomposition as a  method. The c ircular economy has to go hand in hand with the  safety of the users in case of recycling and reusability  especially in plastics where the renewed product has to be  hazard -free for use in grocery products (Tom Keijer, Vincent  Bakker and J. Chris Slootweg, 2 019).     3. Industry Wise Distribution of Consumption and  Waste  Generation of Plastics     Because of multiple  characteristics and properties possessed  by plastics they are used in almost every market sector. Some  of the sectors which have a large share of plastic  usage are  building and construction, consumer products, electronics and  electrical appliances, packaging, automobiles sector, etc.  Talking about the global plastic production and generation by  market sector packaging is alone responsible for 36 percent of   plastic production and 46 percent of plastic waste generation  .   Report  data tells us  that the  packaging sector is responsible for  around  35-40 percent of  usage  as shown in Figure 1  and 59 percent of waste generation.  Since the packaging industry is responsible for almost half of  the waste generation while rest industries combined is possible  rest half, we have chosen to take the packaging industry as our  prime focus to study the recycling a nd reusability for creating  a circular economy of plastic. In the packaging industry, four  types of plastics are used  almost  90 percent  of the time which  are  PP, LDPE,  HDPE, PET Geyer et al.  .          Figure 1.

A Circular  Economy  Model  for Recycling  Packaging  Industry  Plastic  waste to produce  the original  product         4. Circular Economy in Packaging Industry  Plastics     As we have concluded in section 4 that most packaging  materials  are made  of HDPE,  PP, and PET type plastics.  So we  will create  a flow map  for these  plastics  and will form  a sustainable circular model. The journey of plastic will start  with someone  buying  the product  from  stores  and using  it until  the product life cycle ends. After that post consumed plastic  waste will be dumped into the garbage bags which will be  collected by concerned authorities and will be transported to  sorting plants where sorting on the broader level happens  (segregating hard plastic, soft plastic, very large bags, small  bags,  etc).    Most of the plastic will fall in HDPE, PP, or PET category but  if some other type of plastics also gets along which cannot be  recycled  then this type of plastic  is segregated  from  the rest and  sent to serve other purposes. These plastics on further heating  and processing can be converted into poly fuel (for burning  purposes), char or sludge as construction materials, or if not  those  it can always  be used as energy  fuel for generating  power   in power  plants.     Now the HPDE, PP, and PET are being sorted and sent to  plastic processing plants where they are used as raw materials.  Sorted plastic is further being sorted on the bases of colors  and  types where they can achieve purity level up to 99 percent. After  sorting is done individual sorted granules are being liquified  which will act as raw material for making bottles (or products  for which they are used). Then PP is being sent to produce the  bottle caps  and HDPE and PET into the bottle  manufacturing line. These products are not as good as new to  use, and they are being sent to serve their purposes. In this way,  we can achieve circularity in these plastic types and apparently  in the w hole process of  packaging.     5. AHP for best Waste Collection  Method     For the implementation of the model proposed above to work  it is very important to have a proper plastic waste collection  method which will act as raw material for the recycling facility.  There are 5 major waste collection methods employed by  municipalities across the globe namely Curbside Collection,  Vehicular Collection, Drop Off Recycling, Buy Back Centers  and Deposit/Refund program . Now for  choosing one of these meth ods several important factors have  been identified like the operational cost of the method, its social  impact, environmental impact, ease  of sorting at facility end and  ease of collection by workers.    Now, our aim is to find best method for packaging plast ic waste collection method. For which our next step is to have  some expert opinion regarding the economy and level of  operations for all types of garbage collection methods. We  conducted a questionnaire in which 200 experts from Civil  Engineering backgroun d (govt. officials, academicians, Ph.D.   scholars) participated.   We asked them to give rating to different methods of waste  collection based on their operations cost, social impact,  environmental cost, ease of sorting.  Following those results we  came up with an AHP model to formulate the best packaging  plastic waste collection method.        Analytic hierarchy process  is a structured multi -  attribute decision method . The main benefit of  AHP is its compet ence to check and reduce the inconsistency  of professional judgment’s. AHP is applied based on the  information collected to choose the best method for plastic  waste collection.   Our goal is to have a plastic waste collection method which  will support  the Circular  Economy  as shown in hierarchical  manner in Figure 3 . We have  chosen four criteria to determine  the importance of collection method which are Environmental  Impact of the Method, Social  Impact of the Method, and Ease   of Sorting at the plant after coll ection and Operational Cost for  the Methods.       Our alternatives are    Vehicular Collection Method  – Waste is  supposed  to be collected from houses daily, once a day.   Use for management of solid waste to replace drop off or  curbside waste collection method which causes odor and smell due to waste collection at one place and not feasible  for large population areas( Aung May Tin, Donald L.  Wise , Wei -Han Su, Lars Reutergar dh, Seong -Key  Lee,1995)    Curbside Collection Method  - Bins are  places for a locality which are emptied once a day.  For  Increasing waste collection and reducing waste collection  cost. Household waste is brought at one point of the communal waste collect ion point. (Cristina Mora,  Riccardo Manzini , Mauro Gamberi & Alessandro  Cascini,2013)    Drop Off Recycling  - They are dedicated, large  bins where plastics are disposed by their   type. These boxes are examined in a systematic  approach. Collection boxes place near to society which  can be easy to access .    Buy Back Centre  – They are stations or vending  machines or shops where we can replace our waste with some useful  items. Fixed or mobile buy back center are  two options for recycling the waste (Irina Safitri  Zen,Chamhuri Siwar2015 ).   Deposit/ Refund Method - These are  bank   type stations where we can deposit our waste and gain  some sort of credit or even  cash from  them.

Analytic hierarchy process  is a structured multi -  attribute decision method . The main benefit of  AHP is its compet ence to check and reduce the inconsistency  of professional judgment’s. AHP is applied based on the  information collected to choose the best method for plastic  waste collection.   Our goal is to have a plastic waste collection method which  will support  the Circular  Economy  as shown in hierarchical  manner in Figure 3 . We have  chosen four criteria to determine  the importance of collection method which are Environmental  Impact of the Method, Social  Impact of the Method, and Ease   of Sorting at the plant after coll ection and Operational Cost for  the Methods.       Our alternatives are    Vehicular Collection Method  – Waste is  supposed  to be collected from houses daily, once a day.   Use for management of solid waste to replace drop off or  curbside waste collection method which causes odor and  smell due to waste collection at one place and not feasible  for large population areas( Aung May Tin, Donald L.  Wise , Wei -Han Su, Lars Reutergar dh, Seong -Key  Lee,1995)    Curbside Collection Method  - Bins are  places for a locality which are emptied once a day.  For  Increasing waste collection and reducing waste collection  cost. Household waste is brought at one point of the  communal waste collect ion point. (Cristina Mora,   Riccardo Manzini , Mauro Gamberi & Alessandro  Cascini,2013)    Drop Off Recycling  - They are dedicated, large  bins where plastics are disposed by their   type. These boxes are examined in a systematic  approach. Collection boxes place near to society which  can be easy to access .    Buy Back Centre  – They are stations or vending  machines or shops where we can replace our waste with  some useful  items. Fixed or mobile buy back center are  two options for recycling the waste (Irina Safitri  Zen,Chamhuri Siwar2015 ).   Deposit/ Refund Method - These are  bank   type stations where we can deposit our waste and gain  some sort of credit or even  cash from  them. Deposit refund  system gives tax return when its packaging returns for  recycling     Author name / Procedia CIRP 00  000 –000 3           Figure  2. A Circular  Economy  Model  for Recycling  Packaging  Industry  Plastic  waste to produce  the original  product         4. Circular Economy in Packaging Industry  Plastics     As we have concluded in section 4 that most packaging  materials are made  of HDPE,  PP, and PET type plastics.  So we  will create  a flow map  for these plastics  and will form  a sustainable circular model. The journey of plastic will start  with someone  buying  the product  from  stores and using  it until  the product life cycle ends. After that post consumed plastic  waste will be dumped into the garbage bags which will be  collected by concerned authorities and will be transported to  sorting plants where sorting on the broader level happens  (segregating hard plastic, soft plastic, very large bags, small  bags,  etc).    Most of the plastic will fall in HDPE, PP, or PET category but  if some other type of plastics also gets along which cannot be  recycled  then this type of plastic  is segregated  from  the rest and  sent to serve other purposes. These plastics on further heating  and processing can be converted into poly fuel (for burning  purposes), char or sludge as construction materials, or if not  those  it can always  be used as energy  fuel for generating  power   in power  plants.     Now the HPDE, PP, and PET are being sorted and sent to  plastic processing plants where they are used as raw materials.  Sorted plastic is further being sorted on the bases of colors  and  types where they can achieve purity level up to 99 percent. After  sorting is done individual sorted granules are being liquified which will act as raw material for making bottles (or products  for which they are used). Then PP is being sent to produce the bottle caps  and HDPE and PET into the bottle  manufacturing line. These products are not as good as new to  use, and they are being sent to serve their purposes. In this way,  we can achieve circularity in these plastic types and apparently  in the w hole process of  packaging.     5. AHP for best Waste Collection  Method     For the implementation of the model proposed above to work  it is very important to have a proper plastic waste collection  method which will act as raw material for the recycling facility.  There are 5 major waste collection methods employed by  municipalities across the globe namely Curbside Collection,  Vehicular Collection, Drop Off Recycling, Buy Back Centers  and Deposit/Refund program . Now for  choosing one of these meth ods several important factors have  been identified like the operational cost of the method, its social  impact, environmental impact, ease  of sorting at facility end and  ease of collection by workers.    Now, our aim is to find best method for packaging plast ic waste collection method. For which our next step is to have  some expert opinion regarding the economy and level of  operations for all types of garbage collection methods. We  conducted a questionnaire in which 200 experts from Civil  Engineering backgroun d (govt. officials, academicians, Ph.D.   scholars) participated.   We asked them to give rating to different methods of waste  collection based on their operations cost, social impact,  environmental cost, ease of sorting.

Table 7 is the final result  obtained which shows us Deposit and Refund plastic waste  collection method  should  be chosen over others for given  alternatives and in the sense it is was we were pretty much  expecting because the idea of choosing the waste collection  method is not only to create a clean environment but to also  create some sort of economy  from the waste which will work  both ways i.e. helping the society in terms of monetary help  or goods exchange and helping governing bodies to collect  the plastic waste for their better us e. Although this solution  is the best one for current situation, our aim to form a perfect  Circular Economy is adapt refusing the Plastic based  products in the first place. But because of numerous physical  and economical properties of Plastic that’s not go ing to  happen spontaneously, it will be incremental  change  which   we all have  to take for making  earth a better place to  live.    6. Case Study -Rudra Environmental Solutions   ))     Rudra Environment Solutions is a company that is  transfo rming plastic waste into a poly fuel using thermo  catalytic depolymerization which can be used for burning  without any further processing in households and companies.     India alone generates 26000 tons of plastic every year which makes it the 15th largest plastic waste producer. In the  broader  category  plastic  is segregated  into thick  plastic  and thin plastic.  Thick plastic can be recycled very easily but thin plastic (also  known as multi -layer plastic ) ends up in landfills most  of the time.     Rudra  President  Medha  Tadpatrikar  took the matter  in her own  hands and started finding the solutions to make something  valuable from the plastic waste. They talked to many  chemicals, mechanical, and polymer engineers who are  working with plastics. Then they came  to a thought that if the  plastic  is made  of crude  oil why can't we reverse  it. After  many  failed experiments they adapted a technology that generates  high-grade fuel from plastic waste which has high calorific  value  and is more  environments  friendly  at a mere  cost of 23- 34 Rupees per liter. The poly fuel generated has a Sulphur output of 0.17ppm in comparison to diesel's 80ppm  output.     They created a 50kg plant in Jejuri which later converted into a 500kg capacity plant. The  next challenge for them after creating this technology was to  collect plastic from across the area. For that Rudra Founders decided to collect the plastic waste on their own which will  be multilayer beneficial which is the plastic collection for the  enviro nment safety and their plants use.     They have adopted an important concept of segregation at source means separating different types of plastic waste at its  source so that they don't end up in landfills. They created a  cycle  of the collection  in which  residents  put their plastic  waste  at a predefined  location  and once  a day the waste  gets collected.  Proper  education  has been  provided  to residents  about  the harm  and cause of plastics waste and how to segregate plastics at  home.     After reaching plant plastic is segregated by hard and soft plastics. Their shredding process is done separately and then  they get fed to the reactor  where  an anaerobic  reaction  happens  which  yields  almost  70% of poly fuel with 10-15 % of synthesis  gas and a bit of char or  sludge . 100 % of  plastic waste is recycled by this  process.   Current Plant of 500kg  Capacity in their Jejuri   Factory.  The plant is able to process plastic waste that is not easily  recyclable including wrappers, other thin plastic and residual  plastic waste material from businesses and households. Each  ton of plastics produces approximately 600 to 650 lite rs of fuel   – Around 20% fuel  used in the process. Only 20 to 25%  synthetic gas  – used in the process which is very good in  comparison to other processes. Merely 5 to 10% moisture is  used in the process, 5 to 10% Residual cha r – can be used as  road filler w ith bitumen. One more fascinating work of Keshav  Sita trust is creating awareness of waste plastic & segregation  at source.   Collects waste plastic from more than 15000 households  in  and around Pune. Other Collection areas include Thane,  Dombavali, Baramat i, Bhimashankar  and  nearby forts. Till  date they have collected more than 275 MT of waste  plastic  that is Saving of 16.50 lakh KG of emission.     Rudra has helped 10 companies so far to install their  technology in their respective campuses and is aiming for   more. Their model is sustainable, circular, and ecofriendly       7. Conclusion     In growing  world  use of plastic  is exponentially  increasing  with  this the major problem is plastic waste which increase drastically with use of plastic. Environmental concern associated with plastic waste has incited the research in  sustainable energy in which circular economy playing major  role for recycling the plasti c waste and make it use again  without extracting natural resources. In this paper different types of plastic are covered along with their uses and recycle  stages.   To find the best waste collection method using multiple  criteria’s  we have  used Analytical  Hierarchy  process    for  decision making. AHP is an effective method to deal with  complex MCDM problem. Best waste collection method is found out in accordance with less social and environmental  impact, low operation cost and ease of sorting. Here AHP is  used mainly to weigh criteria and purposed most preferable among the studied waste collection methods.  Sub criterias  such as VC, CC, DOC, BBC and D \R. Best among these is  found out using AHP which supports main criterias. Results  stated that deposit or re fund method is best option among all.  D/R method effectively collects the waste and some monitory  gains are also possible. Overall, this paper helps to achieve  circular economy for plastic waste management.
