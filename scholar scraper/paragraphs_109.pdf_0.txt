sustain development and preserve the planet for future generations stahel the strategic need for an alternative model of growth emerged in terms of the debate about the circular economy ce described as an economy with closed material loops over the last decade the ce also due to the challenges posed by of the circular economy action plan ce issues have attracted a great dealof attention the efforts made by the member states to shift their social and economic activities towards circularity have fostered changes in the business model and labor market with new business models and new opportunities resulting from the implementation of the reduction reused and recycling rs actions able to create four million new jobs to generate billion in value added and promote billion worth of investments european commission a furthermore the recycling of municipal waste and the percentage of recycled material reuse with respect to overall materials demand increased during the last ten years despite this the recycled materials do not even reach the of the eu materials demand and a full circularity is applied to only of the world economy which indicates that there are still wide margins for improvement european commission d this idea of ce considers it as a transformative economy rede ning produc tion and consumption patterns inspired by ecosystems principles and restorative by design which increases resilience eliminates waste and creates shared value through an enhanced circulation of material and immaterial ows kirchherr et al this concept highlights the key factors of the paradigm resources ef ciency sustainable economic growth environmental protection and social development following hislop and hill p the circular economy represents a develop ment strategy that maximizes resource ef ciency and minimizes waste pro duction within the context of sustainable economic and social development with the reference to socialeconomic aspects for preston p a circular economy is an approach that would trans form the function of resources in the economy waste from factories would become a valuable input to another process and products could be repaired reused or upgraded instead of thrown away despite the differ ent emphases perspectives and approaches these de nitions evolve around the central idea that the ce is a r system with mainly environ mental economic and social impacts many studies analyzed the issues from a theoretical point of view kirchherr et al elaborated a comparison analysis with ce de nitions ghisellini et al per formed an ample review on ce issues at micro meso and macro level more recently korhonen et al analyzed the emergent literature from several elds to identify concepts and account for the complexity of the issues and the perspectives of different contributions however only a few authors focused on the operative application at macro level ghisellini et al for an extended geographical area ie europe and followed a quantitative approach as well this paper in tends to contribute in bridging this gap firstly the relevant knowledge is gathered and organized so as to rank the eu member states accord ing to their performances in terms of their transition towards the ce in particular the indicators relating to environmental produced munici pal waste produced food waste municipal waste recycling rate eco nomic domestic material consumption market rate of recyclable raw materials production material reuse rate and socioeconomic patents related to circular economy implemented best practices vari ables are used to assess outcomes and highlight good practices so as to identify which of these are more likely to be conducive to a ce as envisioned by the eu in order to assess the degree of transition towards the ce we also evaluated gdp in pps and the ratio of gdpcei correlat ing this information with the quantitative indicators the performances of the eu member state was analyzed in the period the study was developed rstly carrying out a performance analysis of each member state in terms of the implementation of ce activities and the progress made towards the achievement of eu circular objec tives the accumulation of knowledge and application of quantitative indicators should allow for the design of a ce achievement processthe present analysis will be of interest for researchers policy makers and government planners who can acquire information for the devel opment of ce strategies in long term plans the paper is organized as follow sections two outlines a conceptual background on the ce will be developed moreover section shows the state of art of the european context section explains the elaborated methodology and section displays the results and related discussion finally section shows the conclusions of the paper conceptual background the literature and the eu directive and recommendations indicate that most of the issues concerning the ce transition evolve around waste its production its reuse and its disposal in fact the waste man agement is considered by european commission a in overall eu member states a strategic issue to address the transition from lin ear to circular economy liu et al focused on the sustainable waste management under the concepts of the ce through reduce reuse and recycle r rules they underlined the need for an ade quate legal framework and highlighted the importance of investing both in technologies for the ef cient resource recycling and waste man agement infrastructures furthermore iacovidou et al b pre sented an innovative approach complex value optimisation for resource cvorr that seeks to assess how complex value is created destroyed and distributed in resource recovery from waste systems in addition in line with the waste framework directive european parlia ment the municipal waste is a complex bottleneck in waste man agement because even if it does not represent the main part of the total waste generated in the european union measured by weight it is amongst the most complex ones to manage malinauskaite et al in particular according to oecd the municipal waste is dened as the household waste and waste similar in nature and compo sition to household waste its mixed and dispersed nature typically makes it dif cult to treat european parliament b amongst these kinds of wastes food waste is potentially the largest untapped recyclable component of the municipal waste stream food waste accord ing to food and agriculture organizations of the united nation fao refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers food service providers and con sumers it represents a growing problem in our society with almost million tons of waste were generated every year in particular this implies that valuable and often scarce resources such as water soil and energy are being lost and that climate change is being affected at worldwide level only of food waste is diverted towards land lls and incinerators for composting it represents of discarded munici pal waste european parliament b in addition as acknowledged by the waste framework directive european parliament sets a target of of municipal waste to be recycled and prepared for reuse by in eu member states the directive identi es the recycling actions material recycling composting and digestion as a strategic drivers and strengths of the ce policy in europe minelgait and liobikien focused on the importance of reducing reusing and recycling behaviors as effective tools for solving the waste problem in the european union and pointed out that the countries seeking to minimize waste generation should also pay more attention to the pro motion of ef cient consumption and production patterns despite their importance these actions alone do not ensure the transition to wards a total circularity winkler reinforces this concept identifying two structural barriers to the improvement the circularity in terms of product reuse the rst barrier is that a large part of the used materials is still accumulated as inuse stocks and the second is that a large amount of unrecycled materials is sent to land ll reusing used materials as raw materials second raw material is another strate gic cornerstone considering that the rates for some materials are al ready high considerable improvements still seem possible iacovidou et al a horodytska et al hahladakis and iacovidou a marino p pariso science of the total environment in fact by preferring the use of recycled materials to the raw ma terials it is possible to in uence the performance of companies both in relation with their production processes by making them less energy intensive and more resource ef cient and also to their market compet itiveness in fact the rs strategy is a manufacturing strategy which is also driven by market conditions brissaud and zwolinski ac cording to the european commissions circular economy packageeuropean commission b the increase in secondary raw material use will open new markets reduce costs of production increase busi nesses competitiveness encourage new product development create jobs promote innovation and thus stimulate economic growth in order to assess the degree of transition towards ce quantitative indica tors can be useful easac geng et al however they need to be correlated into well devised sets to account for their combined ef fects and the intricacies of the systems dynamics finally data interpre tation should be contextualized to evaluate impacts in each member state in fact elia et al with reference to the methodologies and indicators used for an environmental agency report eea pointed out that no single indicator characteristic or methodology can prove to be adequate to in the interpretation of such a complex phe nomenon moreover iacovidou et al b in the context of the mea surement of resource recovery from waste showed that the proposed methods alone were not able to assess the retention of value in waste resources the ce is a composite objective and therefore a single indica tor does not explain the complexity of a whole transition process such a process needs to be investigated bearing in mind the impact of eco nomic variables such as gdp in pps in each country in order to under stand their potential correlation with quantitative indicators awasthi et al from our research perspective it is essential to outline the european context and analyze the performance of each member state european context in order to investigate ce awareness in the european context it is necessary to understand how the countries are implementing and should implement actions to boost the transition towards the ce thirty ve ofcial reports were issued european commission a b a b c d a b c a bc d a b c d european parliament a b european environment agency eurostat a b a b c european invest ment bank european circular economy stakeholder platform european economic area oecd united nation environment their common denominator was to accelerate the transition of european countries to the ce we elabo rated this information and devised a synoptic framework to outline the progress made so far and to identify possibilities and opportunities for improvement austria austria shows a high ce pro le mainly focused on environmental in novation ie green tech orclean tech in fact the country is ori ented towards a growing improvement of municipal waste recycling and towards the promotion of initiatives supporting the transition ie repanet despite this an effective austrian circular economy strategyshould include objectives aimed at reducing raw material use and waste production because the country is amongst the highest waste pro ducers the countrys national ce plan is focused on this topic and envi ronmental concerns but neglects the economic opportunities that can be offered by the ce sustaining smes and taking advantage by the fact that the service sector represents of national gdp in the transi tion towards the ce could be further strategic actions to implement belgium belgium devised a general framework supporting the ce in fact in this country many initiatives in improving the transition have been de veloped subsides in support of reduction of land ll incineration taxes aimed at minimizing household waste and waste amongst smes invest ments in great infrastructure for separate collection are only some actions that highlight the coordinated governmental actions in this direction despite this belgium still faces issues such as high operational costs of selective waste collection and low environmental taxation bulgaria bulgaria presents a weak position in the ce implementation on the one hand the country has a low per capita waste production but on the other hand there are many dif culties in the waste reduction of smes and especially in the lack of funding available for enterprises efforts should be made to minimize the raw material use and waste production and to introduce tax incentives in support of new ce investments the european commission has recommended that all economic actors should foster r actions in their activities and safeguard prevention practices in waste management croatia croatia presents a pro le with a low per capita waste production but shows criticalities in the recycling of municipal waste in fact the coun try is at risk of not meeting the european recycling targets the national ce plan is mainly focused on waste management and on sustainable tourism the country should gear its efforts towards raising awareness of ce transition policies and promoting tax incentives the european commission has strongly recommended that both the private and the public sectors should implement r actions in their activities and en sure prevention practices in waste management to optimize recycling incineration and land ll use cyprus cyprus is a country with below average in terms of per capita waste production in fact it is one of the greatest waste producers of the eu member states its national ce plan is mainly focused on renewable en ergy wind and solar the country has greatly invested in latest frame work program in resource usage ef ciency and energy network infrastructures its particular geographical collocation does not allow for innovative investments by the multinationals and this ishindering the development in terms of technological innovation cyprus should enact r policies aimed at the reduction of material raw use municipal waste and plastics production and at investing in re search and innovation in order to boost the transition czech republic the czech republic has been quite active in pursuing the transition towards the ce with a good pro le in the packaging waste recycling amongst the eu member states in addition the country which re ceived substantial eu funding mainly concentrated on improving envi ronmentally friendly innovative technologies and activating campaigns to raise the awareness of the population in the reduction of plastic use in addition the country is making efforts to deal with the issue of waste packaging these include enacting proper legislation several initiatives have been undertaken such as the national waste management plan in which the ce has a leading role in the long term planning circular czechia one of the main problems is given by the mu nicipal waste management due to the presence of a great number of landlls furthermore the country has been slow in the implementation of eu regulations on waste management and plastics smes should be a marino p pariso science of the total environment supported with the introduction of tax incentives in ce activities the european commission has recommended that the public and private sector should improve r actions in their activities and ensure preven tion practices in waste management denmark denmark has been active in promoting the transition towards the ce since the beginning the country has leader pro le in household waste management and the reduction of land lls at the same time the coun try is one of the highest per capita producers of municipal waste and does not show a great capacity to minimize the waste produced by the smes many initiatives have been implemented such as the danish strategy for circular economy to boost the transition through the eco nomic support to activities aimed at recirculating materials and reduc ing the waste and enhancing the environmental innovation the country should work harder at coordinating actions at the national level with actions at the local level in order to avoid different ap proaches at municipal level which do not penalize private companies that do not ensure the eu waste hierarchy in addition the transition could be facilitated by introducing tax incentives for repair services recirculation of goods and transactions with clearly de ned social objectives estonia estonia is a country with a great propension towards the transition in fact the country produces little per capita waste and has promoted many actions aimed at reusing materials it has a good system of depositrefund for beverage packaging that allows to collect almost the entire quantity of this kind of waste additionally several other measures have been developed in different contexts to boost the transi tion in fact it is the rst country in which a university tkk established an institute for teaching speci c skills to sustain the transition towards ce institute of circular economy and technology furthermore the country has been able to create effective national networks between all the stakeholders private and public involved in the ce system in order to share information and promote constructive dialogues aimedat creating a national ce strategy ie the circular economy forum the estonian association for environmental management and the min istry of environmental affairs however estonia shows several critical ities in the transition policy with a low resource ef ciency a low ability of national smes in waste reduction practices and an inef cient system of municipal waste and packaging recycling rs finland finland is one of the european leaders in the ce transition the country planned a strong national nancing system to sustain the in novation in the ce finnish innovation fund sitra created a national program for the recycling of nutrients raki developed several projects for plastic reduction and ce ie circwaste and organized the world circular economy forum conference the latter was able to encourage the adoption of several best practices and to establish transition guidelines the transi tion process has also been aided by the national communitys general awareness of the opportunities that the ce could bring about for both traditional enterprises and new emerging businesses at the same time also the government has adopted some incentive tax in the recycling and reuse activities additional efforts should be made to enhance ecoinnovation espe cially in the harmonization of its legislative framework with the european parliaments criteria for sustainable forestry and the safe guard of biological cycle france the countrys ce transition yielded some improvements in the re duction of waste production and the increase of its recycling the coun try published a national ce roadmap with effective objectives in support of the transition thanks to the collaboration between ministry for an ecological the inclusive transition and ministry for the economyand finance and the institut national de lconomie circulaire inec in addition france planned an effective legal framework to encourage of r activities it also imposed legal sanctions for noncompliance with the collection recycling and packaging rules ie plastic it increased taxes on waste burials in land lls and reduced taxes on recycling oper ations further incentives have been granted for social enterprises that collect and sell used goods through the exemption of the vat however the smes require further support a national program should be set up to encourage circular design training so as to reduce the use of raw ma terials and waste production and enhance reuse repair and sharing practices germany germany shows a very advanced pro le in the transition towards the ce with a good management of municipal system of municipal waste recycling the country carried out several wellcoordinated ce initiatives with a good coordination at national level aimed at achieving resource ef ciency and recycling targets it promoted incentives for reuse and the design for recycling ie scal incentives favorable legis lative framework in order to encourage recycling actions it introduceda new packaging act which includes a national packaging registry the strengths of the german ce plan can be found in the strong national pol icy and the awareness and the receptivity of the population towards the sustainability issues on the other hand the country presents a very high per capita waste production that represents the main problem in this context greece the countrys performance is particularly poor both in the private and in the public sector the main weaknesses that can be identi ed in the r actions are mostly due to the dif culties in overcoming the barriers created by the linear economy and therefore the slow response in adopting the eu commissions proposals efforts have been made to promote new legislation and to allocate funds for educational and orga nizational purposes the aim of these measures was on the one hand to enhance knowledge on ce and on the other hand to improve gover nance structures by establishing a speci c operative organization with the task of supporting the transition it is interesting to note that these recent efforts are in line with european commissions suggestions but are clearly inadequate to promote a transition from linear to circulareconomy the european commission has strongly recommended that both the private and the public sectors should promote r actions in their activities and ensure prevention practices in waste management implement the national action plan on circular economy promote transparency laws and regulations simplify administrative procedures implement a circular procurement hungary the transition from linear to circular economy in this member state has been slow and intermittent barriers include a lack of widespread resourceef cient and strategic thinking that could facilitate the transi tion the barriers are present both in the public and the private sector in the private sector the smes and big companies are strongly anchored to a linear economy in the agricultural and the public sector no effective plans or actions were implemented to support the transition the european commission underlined the importance of undertaking a marino p pariso science of the total environment actions to implement a hungarian circular economy roadmap to re duce raw materials use and waste production to increase reuse repair and sharing rs to protect the environment and foster domestic eco nomic growth ireland the member state created a strong reuse and repair network and devised several government support programs however the effects have been more signi cant in the public than in the private sector in fact smes and big companies have not nd a way to improve the ef ciency of the r strategy the european commission underlines the im portance of the implementation of a green deal circular procurement and the enhancement of an irish circular economy roadmap italy italys performance has been more positive in the private in terms of smes transition towards a ce in the public sector the implementation of r strategy has been proven to be much more dif cult at all levels of government on several occasions the european commission pointed out that the policy the policies enacted were not meeting the set objec tives by established deadlines the european commission underlines the importance to implement a green deal circular procurement latvia latvias ce performance is quite poor the main bottlenecks concern waste in terms of management the primary main problems to separate non collection and sorting of materials and the creation of economic value there is also little stakeholders awareness of the need for the transition european commission recommendations are linked to the r strategy and its implementation particularly the suggestions con cern the use of eu nancing also to improve waste management infra structure with common rules at national and local level in addition the application of green deal on circular procurement for both public and private sector and include a free training program lithuania lithuania has done well in private sector smes and big companies implemented strategic actions linked to the end market and environ mental concerns to support the transition instead the experience ofpublic sector is quite different in this sector much more is to be done in this sector a lack of policy measures to promote the transition and the low level of government involvement at national and local level continues to hinder ce efforts the european commission recommenda tions concern the following actions change investment cash ow in in cineration capacity introduce taxes on land ll implement the eu regulations on waste management and plastics rs in the next two years furthermore the eu commission advised to apply for additional eu funds to setup a national support program for public economic growth with focused activities that will support the creation of a ce hub luxembourg luxembourg has done well in several areas concerning the ce par ticularly in the private and the public sector ce systemic actions were focused at the public level in communication with the stakeholders to foster better understanding of the transition from linear to circular economy in terms of material and immaterial environmental develop ment and domestic economic growth the private sector in terms of smes and big companies has reached interesting outcomes linked to the r strategy nevertheless that the european commission recom mendations suggested the following systemic actions the launch of a green deal circular procurement for both the public and the privatesector including a training program the reduction of raw materials use and waste production the creation of a public ce hub malta maltas extremely slow progress mainly due to multiple natural bar riers such as a strong dependence on external energy sources lack of natural resources delay in the innovation process in private sector the european commission recommendations advised to undertake the following systemic actions implementation of the eu regulations on waste management and plastics rs in the next two years and the launch of a green deal on circular procurement for both the public and the private sector and a free training program netherlands this member state is at the forefront of the ce in europe the sys temic actions and initiatives that it carried out consolidated its leader ship role in the transition the netherlands created a multitude of roadmaps plans and formative strategies both private and public sector and involved all stakeholders in the transition despite that the european commission recommended the establishment of a long term budget for the ce to be sustained with domestic resources the pro motion of cross sectoral collaboration and the creation of new circular value chains poland poland is a member state in which the ce concentration is low the reasons can be found rstly in the unresponsiveness of the public sector to the transition in addition the agricultural and manufacturing sectors show serious technological gaps the european commissions recom mendations are linked to the following actions implementation of the polish ce roadmap reduction of raw materials use and waste produc tion rs resource optimization and the achievement of full circularity in the next ten years portugal portugal has shown a strong awareness in public sector with circular agenda linked to the reduction and reuse of material that support the service delivery it is interesting to note that the same agenda was also applied to immaterial resources such as software reuse in public administrations unfortunately the strengths shown in the public sector are not found in the private sector in the private sector smes and big com panies are improved their performance but many criticalities persist the local waste recycling and material reuse practices are particularly inefcient in private sector the r strategy in private sector is very weak the european commission particularly recommended the fol lowing short term actions the intensi cation of measures to protect the environment and the creation of a legislative framework to ensure compliance these actions may be strategic to support the economic growth of local companies and facilitate the transition from linear to cir cular economy romania romania is struggling to achieve better ce performance this coun try is lagging behind the other member states in both private and public sectors at the national and local level this delay concerning both in na tional and local level most measures were partial and uncoordinated the improvements should be linked to the r approach such as the de velopment of new products from reused or recycled materials and reus able products the speci c recommendations of the eu commission for the private and for the public sector include actions related to environ ment and the creation of a legislative framework a marino p pariso science of the total environment slovakia despite the increasing efforts slovakia has achieved negligible tran sition results the management of municipal waste is particularly inef cient also due to the delay in implementation of ce principles in order to speed up the transition towards a ce the european commission rec ommended to launch a green deal circular procurement for both thepublic and the private sector initiate a free training programs and en sure compliance with eu regulations on waste management and plas tics in the next two years in this sense lower per capita municipal waste production rs is a strategic objective that must be met both public and private sector these outcomes are strategic in order to sup port the transition from linear to circular economy slovenia slovenia has initiated numerous initiatives aimed at achieving circularity but many have been successful this is mainly due to the lack of improvements in waste management and a production sys tem that is still rmly anchored to the linear economy the european commission recommendations underlined the strategic importance to realize a green deal on circular procurement for both the public and the private sector including a free training pro gram the eu commission advised the reduction of raw materials use and of waste production on the other hand the country should make more efforts to foster secondary raw material use rs and to establish an appropriate materials accounting system so as to achieve the circularity objectives in ten years in compliance with eu recommendations spain spain is doing relatively well in terms of ce both in the private and public sector spain is making solid progress in the private sector with reference to the smes and big companies the reuse process is advanc ing in terms of employment development and resources ef ciency de spite that a few areas are in need of attention the recycling of municipal waste which needs to be increased and the stakeholdersshould become more involved in this framework the recommenda tions of european commission included the implementation of the new eu regulations on waste management and plastics in the next two years in addition the spanish circular economy roadmap should be enhanced and raw materials use and waste production should be reduced sweden in the sweden there is an impressive implementation of ce many strategies have employed to realize the ce objectives particularly in private sector smes and big companies have adopted behaviors to quickly achieve the goals set by the national government and europe it is interesting to note that this attitude it is not re ected in the public sector in fact speci c objectives have been reached but a systemic change of public administration at local and central level is not yet come examples of good practices in private sector are the low vat rate and income tax reduction for certain repairs following the european commission recommendations these actions could create a general ambition to change the logic from linear to circular united kingdom although there is no national ce strategy in the united kingdom uk several environmental protection plans have been implemented some of their objectives such the reduction of carbon emission and the minimization of waste that converge towards a ce these objectives are actively pursued at regional level despite these local actions there are not general ambitions at national level to reach the ce targets the european commission advised to launch a green deal circular procure ment for both the public and the private sector and to optimize the waste and plastics management systems by two years this analysis was carried out when the uk was yet one of the eu member states the comparison of the of cial reports reveals that the member states show marked differences in the transition results achieved both in terms of the economic sector private or public that has driven the change and in terms of extent and degree of transition in each state criticalities that hinder the transition have emerged both at macroeco nomic level in terms of national government choices and at microeco nomic level connected to speci c sectors and services in the private sector most problems are connected to the dif culties experienced by the big companies and smes in complying with the midterm objectives set by the eu which mostly concern reduction reuse and recycling ac tivities of materials in all economic sectors as to the public sector be sides the above mentioned r problems the main bottleneck concerns the achievement of the national transition objectives this problem is addressed by eu recommendations that suggest an intensi cation of macroeconomic actions such as roadmap green deal and cir cular procurement implementation these actions depend on the wealth production capacity of each country gdp how of this wealth is correlated to purchasing trends gdp in pps the quantity of gdp that is invested in ce for example patents austria belgium bulgaria

science of the total environment indicates different pattern of consumption in fact amongst rst ten food waste producers there are also three countries belonging to the lower medium income group cyprus gdp pfw estonia gdp pfw poland gdp pfw whereas countries be longing the higher income group are not included in the rst ten food waste producers italy gdp pfw luxembourg gdp pfw germany gdp pfw denmark gdp pfw france gdp pfw this is also con rmed by the different waste composition and the gdp per capita values correlation as re ported by eurostat d in fact in line with the highincome coun tries generate in percentage less food waste of total waste but more dry waste which is easier to recycle of total waste by con trast the middle and lowincome countries generate more food waste which amounts to the of total waste this percentage varies according to the level of a countrys economic development whereby less economically developed countries produce more food waste the dmc shows exceptions to the material consumption patterns in fact despite material consumption should increase when the gdp per capitaof the countries increases in the case of uk netherlands france italy and belgium the opposite happens united kingdom gdp dmc netherlands gdp dmc france gdp dmc italy gdp dmc belgium gdp dmc this can be explained by considering that above mentioned countries optimized their production processes so as to use more second raw ma terial as a consequence demand for raw materials another interesting feature is represented by low gdp per capita countries czech republic poland bulgaria romania and estonia these countries are amongst the less industrialized in the eu and so enjoy grater margin of economic growth and receive more eu funds consequents consump tion levels are more likely to grow czech republic gdp dmc poland gdp dmc bulgaria gdp dmc romania gdp dmc estonia gdp dmc another interesting correlation can be identi ed between gdp per capita in pps pmrr and mrrrm

the data of prce are in line with the data of mwrr highlighting countries pro les in which there are more investments in ce that result in a greater number of innovative technologies that may in uence

between these economic elements with the transition degree of the countries towards the ce the g area with six countries out of total of eleven countries shows a high degree of in vestment propension due to the strong commitment of the eu in terms of huge investments towards the eu incoming countries despite this these countries do not reach signi cant transition outcomes in relation with the

science of the total environment in conclusion it can be observed that in order to reduce the gap within the eu member states it is necessary to develop ambitious government actions to support the best possible transition in each country this necessitates a strong economic structure a willingness of the governments in term of policies an entrepreneurial culture on the territory able to understand the economic opportunities behind this change and a population awareness and receptivity able to see in thistransition an opportunity to enhance its social context and wellbeing the ce is an open question and therefore in conclusion the output of discussion linked to research results reject a stance whereby the transi tion must be seen as under constant development and reinterpretation
