levels of compliance with duty of care it also presents the results of analysing tonnesof household waste to identify levels of waste from smes illegally entering the household stream theauthor believes this is the rst study which attempts to estimate levels of business waste abuse of household services through undertaking waste composition analysis with policy makers increasingly focusing on the circular economy the research is the rst to estimate levels of resource leakage of recyclable and biowaste from smes into the household waste stream of smes interviewed were found to be illegally using household services for their waste and for their recycling waste composition analysis of household waste found that of the waste sampled was from smes and that of this waste was

improve the management of the sme waste stream elsevier ltd all rights reserved introduction whilst there is a signi cant body of research into the manage ment of household waste there is surprisingly limited research into the management of commercial and industrial waste hereafter referred to as c i or business waste both in england and world wide the de nition of c i waste in england is set out in section of the environmental protection act great britain and is all waste generated by commerce and industry table provides a summary of the c i waste de nition and a breakdown of waste arisings whilst england has the waste data flow system which requires local authorities to return data to government on the quantities and management of household waste no such system exists for c i waste leading to uncertainties in arisings and data gaps improving the quality of c i data has been identi ed a pri ority by the government department for environment food andrural affairs the latest government estimate is that million tonnes of c i was waste generated in far exceeding the million tonnes produced from households department for environment whilst establishing effective systems for managing c i waste is pivotal in our attempts to meet the principles of a circular econ omy the waste stream has historically been overlooked in both national and european waste policy this was acknowledged in the government s review of waste policy where the government stated it would be taking steps to improve the waste and recycling services to businesses especially small and medium enterprises hereafter referred to as smes department for environment food and rural affairs a this commitment to support smes was reinforced in the government s most recent strategy our waste our

department for environment food and rural affairs and government statistical service esubsequent government studies do not show this detail data shows that of the total ci waste generated in england originated from smes with generated by businesses with less than employees see table historically there has been a focus on the environmental impact of large business but due to economic social and legislative drivers larger businesses in general have well established waste man agement systems for many smes this is not the case in england duty of care legislation sets out the responsibility of businesses towards managing the waste they generate the legis lation aims to ensure that the waste generated does not cause harm to the environment and human health under duty of care busi nesses must ensure the waste they produce is managed in a responsible way and it is illegal for businesses to place waste they generate in services for household waste in other countries similar legislation exists for example in the usa and australia it is com mon for conditions on the use of bins and storage of waste to be set out in ordinances eseecity and county of denver colorado code of ordinances chapter waste management and the city of sydney waste policy local approvals policy for managing waste in public places despite the levels of waste generated frombusinesses there are surprisingly few journal papers on the man agement of c i waste and compliance with duty of care regula tions or similar regulations in other jurisdictions aim and contribution to knowledge this paper presents the results of research conducted in brigh ton and hove city on the south coast of england focusing on the management of waste in smes and compliance with duty of care regulations the aims were to i build on existing literature to understand how smes are currently managing their waste ii to understand levels of compliance with the duty of care regulations iii through waste composition analysis estimate levels of c i waste illegally entering the household waste stream iv consider the implications of current practice and make recommendations the research contributes to the limited knowledge of how businesses are currently managing their waste and levels of compliance with duty of care regulations in addition to collating data from smes through semistructured interviews it is the rst study that the author is aware of which attempts to estimate levels of business waste abuse of household services through un dertaking waste composition analysis with global policy makers increasingly focusing on the circular economy the research is the rst study to estimate levels of resource leakage of recyclable and biowaste from smes entering the residual household stream thatshould be managed more

of care legislation the c i waste stream is diverse and complex with many vari ables the waste ranges from specialist chemicals through to ma terials similar in composition to the household stream the waste is generated from single employee enterprises through to multina tional businesses section of the environmental protection act places a duty of care on all businesses to ensure that any controlled waste produced as part of their business or within their workplace is handled safely and within the law great britain the regulations require businesses not to leave waste or recycling out on the street without arrangements for its collection the waste must be contained properly so it does not spill onto the pavement or attacked by vermin businesses are responsible for their waste until it has been collected and they must ensure that their service provider is a licensed waste carrier registered with the environment agency the regulatory body for waste in england a waste carriers license means the service provider is legally allowed to collect and transport waste throughout the management of waste there is a system of waste transfer notes that records the transfer of waste from one party to another therefore providing an audit stream fig pro vides an overview of the information required on the waste transfer note businesses are legally required to keep copies of waste transfer notes for years as proof of compliance with duty of care transfer notes are issued every time waste is collected however where collection arrangements are consistent for example the same types and quantities of waste are collected each week a single transfer note might be issued to cover the year it is estimated that million waste transfer notes are produced annually and some million are in storage at one time lee to reduce the level of paperwork and to develop a system where the information on these notes could be utilised to improve data on the levels and management of c i waste an electronic version called edoc was launched in the system is voluntary and could be used by local authorities private companies or waste producers and by the beginning of there were over active users edoconline in order to meet duty of care businesses have two main options they could pay the local authority to collect their waste in england local authorities have a legal obligation to manage household waste but they also have a duty to arrange for the collection of waste from businesses if requested great britain this system dates to the public health act of where local authorities were empowered but not obliged to collect waste from businesses and the local authority could make a reasonable charge for collection great britain at present of local authorities provide a business residual waste collection service and provide a busi ness recycling collection however the range of materials collected for recycling varies whereas of these authorities collect cardboard only collect plastic bottles and food waste waste resources action programme alternatively businesses could enter contracts with private waste suppliers ranging from small independent businesses through to multinational companies ghk investigated the management of waste from smes and only of the largest smes used local authorities for recycling services compared to for sole traders this is likely to be due to the private contractors being able to offer a more comprehensive and exible service than local authorities ghk according to the federation of small businesses of small businesses are dependent on private waste management contractors as the local authority in their area does not offer a service cited by private companies meet their needs more ef ciently cited by or that private companies offer a cheaper service cited by the private sector playing an important role in the management of c i waste is not new data from shows that of the million tonnes of c i being generated in england was collected by the private sector department of energy globally the approach towards management of c i waste varies and in some countries businesses are reliant on private waste companies for collection and local authorities have never offered a collection and stopped their ser vices for example the city of copenhagen denmark no longer collects waste and recycling from businesses city of copenhagen in the s new york city s department of sanitation stopped collecting c i waste and transferred responsibility to the private sector new york city department of sanitation noncompliance with duty of care could have a range of waste transfer notes requiredthe type waste being managed using the list of wastes low or european waste catalogue ewc both legally recognised containment time and place of transfer sic code standard industrial for the holder of the waste this is a system for recording business typename and address of the transferor and transferee person receiving the waste and their signaturescapacity in which the transferor and transferee producer importer or registered waste carrier broker or dealer act in that capacity eg their permit number fig information required on a waste transfer note department for environment food and rural affairs r woodard journal of cleaner production implications firstly there is no evidence that a business is man aging its waste responsibly and they could be using the household waste services at the expense of taxpayers in england households pay council tax and some of that revenue contributes towards covering the cost of waste services but only for household waste it is illegal for businesses to use household services to manage their waste or recycling even for micro businesses or businesses based at home under section a of the environmental protection act great britain businesses can be issued with a fixed penalty notice of if they fail to produce a waste transfer note a business that is not having waste collected could illegally be dumping the waste this is known as y tipping the business could either dump the waste themselves or pay to have their waste collected by an unlicensed contractor who then dumps the waste in public spaces or on private land fly tipping is a signi cant problem in england with approximately million reported incidents annually costing local authorities million to clear up department for environment in of these incidents involved c i waste a increase on the previous year department for environment food and rural affairs and government statistical service b fly tipping involving c i waste is not a new problem research from the early s by the london wide initiative on fly tipping estimated between and million tonnes of waste was being y tipped annually with c i identi ed as being a key contributor review of literature on duty of care compliance few previous journal papers have researched compliance with duty of care regulations in england or compliance with similar regulations in other countries wilson led on the two most indepth peer reviewed studies to date assessing compliance with a range of environmental regulations including duty of care within smes whilst both studies had small sample sizes a detailed evaluation of compliance was conducted through visiting premises and inter viewing smes in the rst study a threestage assessment was un dertaken with smes including analysing the detail of information recorded on waste transfer notes only were found to be completely compliant with the duty of care regulations wilson et al further assessment was undertaken at additional smes and were compliant wilson et al radwan et al similarly undertook face to face interviews with nine small hotels to understand level of compliance with duty of care they found that most hotel owners were unaware of their legal requirements for disposing of waste with some illegally using the household services however the study was narrow in scope only looking at hotels and again had a limited sample size of all other studies to date have been commissioned by the waste management industry as they have a vested interest in under standing how businesses manage their waste as historically there has been a problem with businesses using household waste ser vices smes have been motivated by short term gains and many small businesses took their waste home and disposed of it through the domestic route thereby avoiding charges house of lords science and technology committee this view has been supported in studies commissioned to estimate levels of c i waste arisings and management a common method has been to survey a representative sample of businesses based on sector and number of employees and then extrapolate the results studies including jacobs and urban mines have omitted surveying businesses with less than employees as the assumption was that much of this waste would be entering the household waste stream in the ghk study telephone surveys were conducted with businesses of which claimed they had not heard of duty of care and a third stated that they did not have their waste orrecycling collected there was a correlation between the number of employees and illegal use of household services of smes with less than four employees were using household services compared to with over employees and none for smes with over employees the right waste right place campaign was launched in which is managed by the environmental services association and supported by the environment agency chartered institution of wastes management and the environmental services association environment trust the campaign aims to increase awareness of duty of care amongst businesses and contains lots of useful re sources and clear guidance on the requirements of businesses to comply with regulations right waste right place in the campaign published data showing there continues to be high levels of noncompliance with of businesses not knowing what happens to their waste once it leaves site and a third not sure whether they completed or kept waste transfer notes right waste right place table presents results of local authority commissioned studies evaluating compliance with duty of care regulations within smes in each between and of businesses stated they were illegallyusing household services to manage their waste a limitation is that these studies predate and the period of austerity in the uk prior to austerity the government had several initiatives to support local authorities conduct research into waste including the waste implementation programme wip and business resource ef ciency waste centre for local authorities brew post austerity similar programmes have not been established funding more recent research a range of methods were deployed in these studies derbyshire county council lancaster city council and yougov uk used selfcompletion questionnaires studies also deployed online yougov or telephone surveys entec without visiting businesses in person as explored in the methodology these approaches have limitations household services where c i waste could illegally be depos ited include public litter bins bring sites central places located typically in car parks or shopping areas where people can take materials for recycling kerbside collections and household waste recycling sites household waste recycling sites are centralised facilities to where the public can take waste that would not be collected as part of the normal collection service efor example bulky waste garden waste or quantities of waste over the limit the local authority would collect from the kerbside historically there has been a problem with businesses illegally using these facilities cameron beaumont and bridgwater undertook the most detailed nationwide study to date to evaluate business waste abuse at household waste recycling sites the study involved observing waste entering household waste recycling sites in the bristol area of england for a week all vehicles entering the sites were observed and through a combination of vehicle type type of waste being delivered bins used presence of objects indicating a trader such as toolsinvoices and the subjective view of the surveyor an assessment was made on if the waste originated from a trader the surveyor also made an estimate of the volume of waste beingdeposited however the research did not conduct detailed analysis to understand the weights and composition of waste entering the sites to corroborate the observations it was estimated of waste entering the sites was delivered by businesses at that time if the gure was extrapolated across england and wales it would equate to tonnes of waste illegally entering sites per annum in the government announced the land ll tax which placed a levy on each tonne of waste sent to land ll thereby making it more expensive with the aim of promoting alternatives higher up ther woodard journal of cleaner production waste hierarchy landll tax hc deb november vol cc in turn this cost was passed onto the generators of waste with the cost of collection increasing cameronbeaumont and bridgwater estimated that business waste illegally entering household waste recycling sites doubled following the introduction of the land ll tax as it became more expensive to have waste collected businesses looked at alternative ways of disposing of their waste in hampshire county council esti mated that of all waste delivered to household waste recycling sites in the county originated from c i sources costing over million per year to dispose of maynard and cherrett in recent years local authorities have implemented strategies to cut down on business use of household waste recycling sites including height barriers preventing vans from accessing sitesvehicle recognition software to monitor any vehicles frequently using sites and security guards these restrictions combined with other factors such as the recession materials being diverted to kerbside collections and better segregation of waste at sites has seen an overall reduction in residual waste entering household waste recycling sites from million tonnes in to million tonnes in a reduction department for environment food and rural affairs monitoring and enforcing business waste abuse at household waste recycling sites is somewhat easier than preventing the illegal use of services for household waste at the kerbside or public spaces by businesses no studies to date have attempted to identify and quantify levels of c i waste being illegally deposited through kerbside collection or household waste services in public spaces methodology phase interviews with businesses semi structured interviews were conducted with smes in brighton hove city all participants were recruited by invites submitted through business networks or cold calling onrecruitment an interview was arranged at a time convenient with the business semistructured interviews were conducted faceto face and on average lasted min most studies conducted to date have involved either selfcompletion online or telephone surveys this research builds on the approach adopted by wilson and radwan through integrating visits to business premises and conducting interviews in person interviews have certain advan tages over selfcompletion questionnaire efor example the inter viewer can explain questions that the respondent has not understood can ask for further elaboration of replies phellas et al and the researcher can check they correctly understand the response which is not always possible with written replies denscombe phellas et al suggest being asked questions by a sympathetic listener is experienced as morerewarding by research participants than being requested to com plete a form for an anonymous researcher conducting interviews in person also means you are likely to get fuller responses compared to online surveys where participants may drop out and in general elicit lower response rates waste and resources action programme through conducting facetoface interviews and visiting the premises the researcher can also validate the re sponses phellas et al waste and resources action programme in particular for this research check the waste collection arrangements through observing the collection con tainers present and waste levels businesses were chosen to broadly re ect business types in the city with of participants from retail hospitality including restaurants hotels and takeaways legal services and the remainder from a range of business types of smes interviewed had less than employees therefore classi ed by the eu as micro businesses with having less than employees to ensure data was collected to provide a true indication of how the businesses were managing their waste there was no discussionin regards duty of care and their regulatory obligations businesses were questioned on waste management practice

protection act guidelines phase waste composition analysis brighton and hove city is home to people and located on the south coast of england the city has a population density of persons per hectare placing it in the most densely popu lated local authority areas in england ofce of national statistics of the housing stock is ats a mixture of purpose built ats converted or shared houses or apartments in commer cial buildings compared to for england brighton hove city council historically in england local authorities have collected waste directly from households either weekly or increasingly fortnightly the population density and high level of ats has led to historical waste management problems with resi dents not having space to store waste or not wanting to keep it in their homes therefore putting waste out on noncollection days as a popular tourist destination and home to two universities the problem is exasperated by a high transient population and resi dents not knowing how the waste collection system works or their collection day being located on the coast brighton hove has problems with gulls ripping open bags and thereby littering the streets in response in the city council trialled communal containers for waste collection where residents deposit waste at their convenience with the council emptying bins at regular in tervals the system has operated in parts of continental europe for many years and has now been extended in the city with additional communal bins introduced for recycling in there are now around c l residual bins on the streets of the city to cater for approximately of households this communal approach has been adopted by the other uk authorities including bristol bristol city council edinburgh city of edinburgh council and newcastle newcastle city council the research aimed to understand how much c i waste was being deposited into these containers eagain the containers were for household waste only and it is illegal for businesses to use them based on guidance from the local authority samples of waste were taken from areas etwo from the city centre and two from resi dential areas a sample from each area was taken on a monday and a wednesday it was expected that the levels of c i waste present would be higher in the city centre due to the proximity of busi nesses and on the monday as this would be following the weekend when businesses would have had much of their weekly trade iewaste from saturday and sunday would be in the collection for monday bin loads were collected as per normal and delivered to a depot for sorting the sample was sorted into big bags small bags and other waste such as loose bulky waste and then weighed all bags were then checked for evidence of c i waste ethis included checking for letter heads commercial type packaging receipts invoices and bags clearly of different composition to household waste c i waste was then isolated sorted into categories and weighed all staff working on the project complied with the dataprotection act ethe focus of the research was to understand the levels and composition of c i waste rather than identifying indi vidual businesses for follow up at the time of study brighton and hove city council did not offer a waste or recycling collection to businesses and therefore com panies had to use nonpublic sector providers or take materials to dedicated business waste drop off facilities in order to comply with duty of care regulations results phase einterviews with businesses table summarises the key results from interviews with the smes despite the duty of care regulations openly stated that they used household services to manage their residual waste with using household waste recycling sites or public bins and taking waste home to be put out in household collections were doing both similarly recycled used household waste services with using public bins or household waste recycling sites and taking recycling home to place in kerbside collections were doing both of businesses had service providers for collecting recycling but used household services to manage certain materials including plastic bottles cardboard and metals which they did not generate in signi cant enough quantities to warrant a separate collection only of businesses interviewed said they had contracts in place for managing residual waste and for recycling in total different contractors were named for handling waste recycling or specialist waste streams such as cooking oil ethis excludes those with internal systems or who did not want to name their contractor businesses were given the opportunity to set out barriers to recycling eunsurprisingly cost lack of suitable services and lack of space were cited as the main barriers see fig interestingly only of businesses stated that they did not produce enough recyclables to warrant a collection based on the information supplied by participating businesses it was possible to make an estimate of weekly waste and recycling generated for of businesses sampled see table only of businesses generated less than l of waste per week ethe size of a typical business waste sack would need a container more than l to contain a weeks waste and recycling phase ewaste composition analysis kg of waste was collected for analysis with samples vary ing from kg to kg see table note sample of kg is not included due to no c i waste being identi ed in the sample most of the waste collected was household waste as expected however was found to be from businesses levels of business waste varied from from the city centre on a wednesday through to in the residential area on the monday the c i waste stream is heterogeneous table contains details on the most common materials and items present detailed datawas collected on all materials but for brevity these have been combined into the other category representing of the total ci waste identi ed this includes hessian sacks hair candles various types of dense plastic items and packaging polystyrene and foil based upon materials which are commonly included in dry recyclable materials collections in england of the material could have been recycled the main dry recyclables were cardboard recyclable paper and glass by far the biggestr woodard journal of cleaner production category was food waste representing of all business waste present from the composition analysis a range of indicators were developed to identify c i waste that might be useful for other re searchers looking to undertake similar studies see table across the four samples there were incidents of business waste abuse of household services involving businesses three businesses were found to be using the bins on two occasions in addition there was business waste from other sources but there was a lack of evidence of where it was from for example several cardboard boxes had their delivery address labels removed eseemingly on purpose to avoid detection of incidents involved businesses from thehospitality industry including cafes takeaways restaurants and bed and breakfasts and this is re ected in the large quantity of food waste present discussion the results of the interviews and composition analysis support ndings from previous research that a signi cant number of busi nesses are still failing to meet their legal duty of care requirements and that there is widespread use of household services only ofbusinesses had a contractor in place for residual waste and a contractor for recycling of businesses openly stated that they used household services for residual waste and for recycling of the waste sampled from the household stream was found to be from businesses the implications of these ndings are re ected on below financial implications to the taxpayer businesses using household services are having their waste collection costs subsidised by taxpayers in an estimated million was spent by local authorities on waste

waste stream nationally savings of million could be achieved from not collecting and disposing of this waste the diversion of this waste from the household waste stream could generate signi cant nancial savings to local authorities with money redirected to priority areas such as health care and education unfair economic advantage over competitors businesses that use household services have an economic advantage over their competitors who are being responsible and fullling their duty of care obligations a claim made by some smes is that they do not generate enough material to warrant payment for a separate waste or recycling collection ghk it was possible to estimate waste and recycling arisings per week for of businesses sampled only generated less than l per week e the size of a typical sack and only less than l the size of a typical wheeled bin the average arisings for those businesses that did not have a contractor was l when questioned regarding barriers to recycling only cited not generating enough waste as being a barrier to recycling the results would suggest that for most smes sampled they generate enough waste to justify at the very least a residual waste collec tion other barriers such as will to recycle space cost and access to services are more signi cant similar barriers to recycling in smes were identi ed by the federation of small businesses ghk parsons and kriwoken radwan et al and thewaste resources action programme public health implications an important issue is the potential impacts on public health of businesses using household services of the waste sampled was food waste and unless this is managed responsibly this could have severe impacts upon public health during the analysis nearly kg of raw chicken carcases and bones evidently from a quick serve restaurant were found deposited within the household stream in addition to illegally using household services the busi ness was in noncompliance with the animal biproduct regula tions which sets out the requirement for managing food waste department for environment food and rural affairs b and therefore putting public health at risk resource leakage the research highlights the leakage of valuable resources from business waste entering the household stream combined food waste and dry recyclable materials totalled which could have been managed in a more sustainable way with

has a recycling target for household waste to meet for in england the household waste rate has stagnated increasing by since reaching in department for environment food and rural affairs and government statistical service a of local authorities have seen their recycling rate reduce over the last years department for environment food and rural affairs through businesses using household services the total re sidual waste level is increased which in turn impacts on the uks ability to meet the recycling target conversely it is noted that to a lesser degree levels of c i waste are also entering the household recycling stream thereby contributing towards the target with even higher targets announced in the waste frame work directive eu directive business waste levels entering the household waste stream could pose a further challenge in achieving these targets impact of austerity measures on enforcement levels in the government announced public spending cuts of billion by and

across local authority waste recycling and street cleansing services across the uk and the republic of ireland through surveying local authority of cers of local authorities responding stated they had

in business waste abuse at household waste recycling sites with citing a reduction in terms of household collections from the doorstep felt there had been an increase in abuse of household services with none stating there had been a reduction this perceived increase could be due to local authorities having less enforcement resources plus businesses having to cut costs during the recession thereby looking for cheaper ways to get rid of their waste moreover the reported levels of y tipping from businesses increased in compared to the previous year department for environment food and rural affairs and government statistical service b less enforcement re sources could lead to the y tipping problem getting even worse the local government association the body representing local government estimate there will be a billion funding gap for local authorities by eas such resources for enforcement will be further stretched recommendations for consideration there are a variety of possible options to improve the manage ment of waste from smes and increase compliance with duty of care duty of care register throughout the country enforcement of duty of care by local authorities varies greatly and there is no available data on the level and type of enforcement activity being applied at present there is no universal duty of care register that collates information on how businesses are managing their waste and that have a contract with a licensed waste carrier development of such a register would have several key bene ts it would provide local authorities with knowledge of which businesses are managing their waste respon sibly with registered contractors the register could be used to identify businesses that are potentially not complying with duty of care and who the local authority could target to offer support and guidance and if noncompliance continues enforcement several bodies are engaged with visiting businesses to ensure they are complying with environmental and public health regulations for example waste of cers inspecting business compliance with duty of care water companies inspecting for business compliance with discharge regulations under the water industry act great britain premises found to be discharging fats oils greases and food scraps into the sewer causing blockages or compromise the safe operation of our assets can be prosecuted environmental health of cers inspect businesses for health and safety food hy giene and food standards all these stakeholders have an interest in ensuring businesses are managing their waste responsibility and data gleaned from inspections could be consolidated into the duty of care register thereby avoiding the duplication of effort the duty of care register could also potentially act as a deterrent to business waste abuse of household services businesses are required to pay business rates and they could be legally required to annually include a copy of their duty of care certi cate when returning relevant paperwork whilst this would require administration from the local authority the costs could be offset from savings accrued from less waste needing to be disposed of through the household stream less clear up costs from y tipping revenue generated from targeted intelligence led enforcement activity which would result in either businesses being ned for non compliance or signing up to a collection service provided by the private or public sector the argument against this would be it becomes an added burden to businesses however the counter argument is that thosebusinesses being responsible are being disadvantaged by those rival businesses who are acting illegally variants of this system are already operating in the usa in new york city under the recycling requirements for licensees pri vate waste management companies are required to submit a list of customers on a biannual basis to the business integrity commis sion who regulate the private waste sector in the city this includes contact details of all customers the date on which services commenced total charge per month and where the material was taken to new york department of sanitation a similar system operates in other parts of the usa such as san diego city of san diego a variation is where businesses themselves are required to supply evidence of their waste management arrange ments for example businesses have been legally required to recycle in philadelphia since under the pennsylvania act and city ordinance a city of philadelphia businesses are required to ll out a recycling plan online explaining the recycling activities of the business and details of the contractor e hence the city has records of which businesses are complying with regulations however there have been concerns expressed regarding the effectiveness of the system with many businessesreportedly not submitting recycling plans and lack of follow up from authorities mcdaniel and bond increased accessibility for smes to services in england there is a clear delineation between the household and c i waste stream ehowever in other countries the waste streams are closer aligned in some countries business generating less than a certain quantity of waste or located in a speci c geographical area are permitted to use household services thereby supporting smes who want to recycle globally there are many models that have been implemented in antwerp belgium small businesses are allowed to use households services pers com in baltimore usa businesses located within residential communities may participate in the recycling programme free of charge baltimore city department of public works in louisville usa businesses that generate or less l containers of waste per week located in urban services district are offered the same service as households businesses generating more waste have to contract a private hauler city of louisville adop tion of a similar system in england would increase accessibility of recycling services to smes thereby reducing resource leakage plus additional ef ciencies mcleod et al researched the poten tial resource ef ciency savings of collecting waste from homes and commercial premises together this approach led to a reduction in vehicle mileage equating to savings of and carbon equivalent savings of kg in england whilst waste and recycling are collected by different service providers depend ing on the origin of the waste it often ends up being taken to the same facility the environmental services association has advocated increased harmonisation to manage household and c i waste together policy exchange have supported the merger of the c i and household waste stream placing a duty on local authorities to collect from small businesses ethis approach would improve services for businesses yield ef ciency savings and lead to better planning for c i waste conclusion the research highlights the inadequacies of the existing approach to managing waste from smes in england the results reinforce those from previous studies that a signi cant number of smes are failing to comply with duty of care regulations and are using household services to dispose of their waste ofr woodard journal of cleaner production businesses stated that they used household services for residual waste and for recycling of the residual waste sampled of the waste sampled originated from businesses and was dry recyclable materials or food waste eresources are being wasted globally waste from smes is an important and often overlooked waste stream if circular economy principles are to be achieved to need to set up smarter systems to manage waste ows from smes this includes enforcement of relevant legislation increasing awareness of waste through further supporting initiatives such as right waste right place and importantly developing a more ef fectives holistic waste management system which places resources at the core this paper presents some recommendations for consideration ranging from developing a duty of care register to opening household services to smes in the waste strategy the government pledged to improve the management of waste from smes including introducing new legislation to make separa tion of dry recyclable materials mandatory and investigating how shared services could help to improve recycling in smes whilst encouraging similar pledges have been made in the past with limited impact interestingly recent governments reports show that small and micro businesses would not be required to separatematerials for separate collection until and respectively e over a decade after the government announced proposals in the waste strategy suggestions for further work are to duplicate the study in other parts of the country for comparison and to conduct a more detailed review on systems implemented in other countries to manage waste from smes other suggestions are to model the potential resource ef ciency bene ts from closer integration of the house hold and sme waste streams and to better understand the ap proaches being used by local authorities to raise awareness amongst business to their duty of care requirements and enforcement activity eincluding the adoption of edoc since the completion of this research brighton hove city council have implemented a collection service for c i waste and have a new enforcement policy eresearch could be conducted to evaluate what impact these new arrangements are having credit authorship contribution statement ryan woodard conceptualization
