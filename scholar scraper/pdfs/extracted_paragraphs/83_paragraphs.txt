As pathways to both systemic and micro-scale transformations,  there remain many challenges to making Circular Economy actionable. One such challenge is facilitating the  emergence of the ‘circular consumer ’. Here, we are all encouraged to shift everyday practices to consume new  products and services and/or participate in the ‘Sharing Economy ’: all of which are claimed, in some prominent  debates, to automatically offer more ‘convenience ’ for the consumer. In response, this paper argues that viewing  such debates through the lens of Consumption Work offers a different picture of what it takes to be, and what we  need to know about, the circular consumer. Consumption Work refers to the labour integral to the purchase, use,  re-use and disposal of goods and services. This paper argues that the nature and scope of such work has been  underplayed in Circular Economy debates to date, and that becoming a circular consumer requires varied and  unevenly distributed forms of Consumption Work, which in turn, has significant implications for the success of  Circular Economy. This paper thus proposes a research agenda into this topic, outlining five, inter-related,  critical issues that a Circular Economy research agenda must address, including questions of who undertakes  Consumption Work; to what ends; and how its multiple forms are coordinated within and beyond the household.    1.Introduction: circular economy and Consumption Work  ‘Circular Economy ’  is now central to debates and interventions  that aim to transition systems towards greater environmental sustain - ability. While definitions abound, CE is commonly understood as  transforming inter-linked production-consumption systems to ones  ‘where the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in  the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste mini- mised ’ . Such transformations involve  step-changes to industrial processes and product design, as well as  reconfigured business models —for example from ‘sale and-ownership ’  to ‘product service systems ’ —that in turn impact con- sumption patterns, practices and norms. Although sometimes presented  as a new framework, CE has its roots in fields such as industrial ecology  ; sustainable and ‘cradle-to-cradle ’  design ; and ‘natural capitalism ’  : fields with their own histories of debate, exper - imentation and implementation .  As such, part of the appeal of recent iterations of CE is how they bring  together disparate fields into a model of comprehensive, macro-scale transformations. However, as Gregson et al.  note, despite  ‘idealized visions of the circular economy ’ that propose a producer-led,  industrial revolution, much CE policy and practice thus far is largely one  of enhanced, post-consumer waste management. Nevertheless, the Eu- ropean Union and China are amongst those now aligning their 21st  Century regional development and competitiveness agendas with the  perceived advantages of CE (e.g. see European Commission, 2015 ;  McDowall et al., 2017 ). According to the European Commission (2015:  2) this will help in ‘protecting businesses against scarcity of resources  and volatile prices ’ while creating improved system efficiencies, new  jobs, and greater ‘social integration and cohesion ’.  In response to such ambitions, a rapidly growing and cross-  disciplinary research literature has emerged, exploring multiple facets  of CE. This journal alone has published many CE papers including  research focused on Sustainable Supply Chain Management (Sadrnia  et al., 2020 ); Circular Business Model innovation (Guldmann and  Huulgaard, 2020 ); and country-level enactments of the CE (Ghisellini  and Ulgiati, 2020 ). Research on the consumption and consumer-related  aspects of CE has also been part of this literature but to date has  constituted a smaller body of work compared to other topics  *Corresponding author.

This latter body of work at times utilises social psychology meth - odologies to, for example, model relationships between environmental  awareness and purchasing intentions . Whilst  insightful, critiques of such approaches outline the problems with  supposing clear relationships exist between individuals ’ awareness,  values or attitudes, and their consumption activity: the notorious ‘atti- tude-behaviour ’ or ‘value-action ’ gap .  As such, consumers ’ knowledge and/intention often illuminate little  about what they actually do (Carrington et al., 2010 ; Davies et al., 2002 ;  Sol˘er et al., 2020 ). In response, other social researchers have fore- grounded the importance of contexts of actions, e.g. the role infra- structure plays in facilitating forms of sustainable consumption (Sol˘er  et al., 2020 ): as well as the actual resource management practices car- ried out in households (e.g. Mylan et al., 2016 ; Pedersen and Manhice,  2020 ). Together, this work underscores the importance of bringing  varied social theories —which focus on the relationship between life as  lived, and the materials, cultures and discourses these lives are  embedded in—into CE research (Holmes, 2018 ; Mylan, 2015 ; Welch and  Warde, 2015 ).  This paper builds upon, and contributes to, this body of theoretically  informed social science CE research. The main goal is to argue for the  analytical value of bringing the sociological concept of Consumption  Work  into CE research, to establish  an associated and comprehensive research agenda. Briefly, Consump - tion Work  denotes forms of labour ‘necessary for the purchase, use,  re-use and disposal of consumption goods and services ’ (Wheeler and  Glucksmann, 2015a : 37). Such now-ubiquitous labour includes, for  example, cleaning, sorting and removing household recyclables; scan- ning barcodes at a self-service check out; building flat pack furniture; or  self-installing home broadband. As such, CW is now often a  non-negotiable component ‘to complete and complement an economic  process ’ , thus highlighting how the seemingly  private domain of the home and of household consumption is actually an  integral part of the successful functioning of macro-economic systems.  This paper argues that the lens of CW can thus offer vital insight into  how consumer-focused forms of CE require both the reconfiguration of  existing modes of CW  and/  or the establishment of new forms of CW (e.g. repairing or sharing  material assets). In turn, the ability of individuals and households to  undertake such CW depend in part upon various, vital resources (e.g.  time, skills, social capital), all of which are not distributed equally  among populations. This paper argues that therefore the nature, scale  and distribution of CE CW will have a significant impact on the suc- cessful emergence of the ‘circular consumer ’. Yet, to date, this argument  has not received much critical attention in the published literature or  broader debates. Thus there is a need for an active and focused research  agenda, proposed herein.  In making these arguments this paper first explores the role ascribed  to the CE consumer in some mainstream policies and debates. It then  outlines the theory and application of CW, arguing for its utility in  gaining fresh insight into the role of consumption in CE. Then the theory  of CW is applied to examples of consumer-focused CE practices  including forms of sharing and repairing. This paper then concludes by  outlining a research agenda for CW and CE, which is argued to offer  much-needed insight into this integral part of broader CE agendas.  2.Consumers and consumption in CE: from acceptance to  engagement  There is a growing body of research that examines CE consumption,  including its dynamics in the household sphere as part of a CE agenda  . Such a focus is vital to any sustainability agenda. For  example, the Committee on Climate Change  calculated that UK  emissions of 8798 kg CO2 e per household must drop to 1,160 kg if we  are to reach the goal of net zero emissions by 2050: a situation that  prompted the ex-UK Government Chief Scientist to note that UK life- styles must change and that we all must ‘shift ourselves away from  consuming ’ .  This latter point is one many researchers and commentators have  made for decades . Yet, consumption indicators  continue to show clear resource-use increases around the world (e.g.  IRP, 2017 ), even taking into account effects of the global Covid-19  pandemic on greenhouse gas emissions  While  some advocates argue that consumption in the CE is not about  consuming less but consuming differently , others point out  that this assertion is problematic . For one,  certain CE actions (e.g. creating new markets for down- and up-cycled  goods) are doing little to prompt much-needed absolute demand re- ductions, with considerable system-level rebound effects observed (Zink  and Geyer, 2017 ). As such, CE research to date has arguably paid too  much attention to forging and promoting new business markets and  models and not enough to ‘slowing the loops ’  of  existing markets and models.  How, then, is the consumer conceptualised in CE thinking? One  much-repeated visual representation of CE (i.e. the ‘butterfly diagram ’:  see Ellen MacArthur, 2017 Foundation ) places the user/consumer as the  central node around which resources flow and new practices emerge i.e.  those of sharing, repairing and maintaining goods, and moving goods on  for reuse, remanufacturing, and/or recycling .  Yet—despite the active engagement of householders required by many  of these practices, as well as the skills, knowledge and time invol - ved—the role of the consumer in CE has been framed primarily in terms  of willingness to take up and ‘accept ’ new business models and/or  products .  Although one can debate what the notion of ‘acceptance ’ means here, it  arguably suggests a largely passive and unproblematic engagement with  the requirements of CE . That is, one where  production-consumption systems change around us all and our role is to  be the recipient  of these changes as part of prevailing ‘green  growth ’ approaches .  Take, for example, the work of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the  preeminent non-governmental proponent of CE. Their report ‘Opportu - nities for the Consumer Goods Sector  arguably places consumer  participation in new goods and services as something of an after-  thought. Once new CE market opportunities have been identified,  ‘Consumer research would … be needed to better understand con- sumers ’ acceptance ’ . Although others argue that we all  should be included in creating CE goods and services from their initia - tion e.g. participatory sustainable design ,  such messages do not appear to have infiltrated high-level CE discourses.  Along similar lines, Repo et al.  assert that there is a pressing  need for EU citizens to ‘become integrated in policy planning as active  players in the realm of circular economy ’: a situation they argue is far  from the current role ascribed to the consumer in EU CE policies.  How, then, is the consumer responding to CE interventions to date?  Notable CE consumer research does exist, for the most part focusing on  the willingness of consumers to undertake specific CE-related con- sumption practices ,  which may or may not involve new forms of CW e.g. undertaking in- dependent research into buying a new product before purchasing it.  Such work sits alongside other research that explores the numerous  barriers to the collective acceptance of new products and services (e.g.  see Camacho-Otero et al., 2018 ). Taken together, findings to date have  suggested little reason to be optimistic that such approaches to more  circular consumption can deliver CE ambitious goals. For example, Van  Weelden et al.  outline how refurbished mobile phones are often  rejected by consumers looking to buy a new phone due to a lack of K. Hobson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Journal of Cleaner Production 321  128969 3knowledge about their availability along with concerns about the pro- cess of refurbishment . On the same topic,  Hobson et al.  outline how mobile phone users express reluctance  to undertake any additional form of CW when purchasing or using their  phones, as well as reluctance to recycle their current phones because of  data concerns.  On similar lines, single product case studies exist that outline the  numerous barriers to consumer uptake of CE business models and  practices . These include  personal characteristics, price, confidence in the offer, convenience, and  knowledge . Thus, it  appears there are many challenges in getting the consumer on board  with the CE, particularly with more ‘circular’ products and services  being brought into already crowded and competitive markets (e.g.  consumer electronics: see Hobson et al., 2018), made more challenging  by the ‘inherent irrationality of consumer behaviour’ .  One potentially fruitful way of reconceptualising such challenges is  to bring the concept of ‘Consumption Work’  into conversation with  such findings, which this paper argues could help illuminate missing or  under-developed facets of the CE consumer. For one, talk of new CE  business models often fails to acknowledge the CW required. This may  include engaging in a range of material-specific recycling practices;  borrowing rather than owning items; learning how to maintain and  repair possessions; and/or acquiring the knowledge to choose products  on the basis of ‘circular’ characteristics such as ‘modularity’ and product  longevity. As such, the CE both introduces new, and extends existing,  forms of domestic labour: labour that is often represented, ironically, as  being accounted for by the concept of ‘consumer convenience’ in the  extant literature .  However, as the remainder of this paper will argue, labelling CE  practices as convenient tells us little about how the (potentially con- flicting) demands of CE impacts on everyday lives, particularly when  more than one practice is brought into play e.g. does more time spent  repairing goods mean less time is available for other CE-related prac- tices? It also does little to illuminate who, where and in what ways new  forms of CW are distributed through populations: a vital issue if we think  that alterations to consumption practices need to be defused and nor- malised throughout society, to become integrated into everyone’s  practices. The following section develops these arguments further,  expanding on the concept of CW and using examples from ‘sharing  economy’ practices to illustrate the argument further.  3.Consumption Work in the circular economy  3.1. The concept of consumption work and its relevance to the circular  economy  Since early industrialization social researchers have been keenly  interested in questions of divisions of labour. Initially focusing on the  workplace, research explored how the specialization of jobs and skills  have far-reaching ramifications for socio-economic equality, and thus  broader distributions of political agency and power. Subsequent focus  has included unpaid forms of labour e.g. gender divisions within  households  as well as how informal economies  constitute networks of communal and household reciprocity (Pahl,  1984). Miriam Glucksmann  has further extended  these arguments (see also Wheeler and Glucksmann, 2013, 2015a,  2015b) highlighting how a key part of unpaid labour is CW. That is, the  forms of labour ‘necessary for the purchase, use, re-use and disposal of  consumption goods and services’ . This labour includes  consumption enacted through varying modes of provision, whether  ownership or access-based.  CW is thus not about any form of domestic labour. Specifically, it  concerns the work that householders ‘regularly perform’ which ‘is in- tegral to the completion of a process of production or service provision’  . Glucksmann  notes how many CW activities thus go unrecognised as labour but should be  classified and analysed as such given how integral CW is to ‘material  social reproduction’ . For example, studies of environmental  labour within the domestic sphere (e.g. practices such as recycling and  preventing food waste) have shown that women do more of this work (e.  g. Organo et al., 2013), which means that ‘men and women are differ - ently affected by sustainable consumption policy’ (Middlemiss, 2018:  46). And as the forms of labour required by us all to consume continue to  shift—e.g. the rise of self-service supermarket check-outs and  self-assembly furniture —so do the  requirements and divisions of these forms of labour. Such requirements  are not just a matter of having more or less time available to spend on  said tasks. They also speak to the need for consumers to have access to  particular skills, knowledge and/or other resources (e.g. tools for  self-assembly furniture) as well as personal attributes (confidence,  willingness): all of which are not evenly distributed amongst  populations.  New forms of CW include practices that are a pivotal part of CE. The  labour required for domestic recycling—cleaning, sorting, and putting  items on the kerb, or taking them to a recycling station—is vital to the  successful functioning of contemporary waste management industries  and systems , with their incorrect  execution being one of the main challenges for the modern recycling  industry . Add to that the other consumer/user practices  that CE foregrounds  and it quickly  becomes apparent that the consumers’ roles in the CE is far beyond that  of ‘acceptance’ of novel products and business models. And while it can  be claimed that household eco-efficient technologies and products can  sidestep some of these issues, doing most of the work for the house - holder, research has shown non-trivial forms of ‘green labour’ are still  involved in the operation and management of, for example ‘smart’ do- mestic technologies . Thus, it is arguable that without  the widespread adoption of the forms of CW that the CE necessitates, the  entire project becomes untenable, particularly given comments that  current CE framings and policies fail to resonate with citizens (Repo  et al., 2018).  To be clear, the concept of the CW is not deployed here to bemoan  the unpaid labour of consumers, as an exploitative facet of current  systems per se. Nor does it go to the other extreme, celebrating the  multiple benefits that CE practices are often charged with ushering in,  for example, through forms of ‘collaborative consumption’ (see Botsman  and Rogers, 2011) that are claimed to create other social ‘goods’ (see  Penz et al., 2018). Rather, its work here is that of a conceptual inter- vention, the empirics of which are argued to shed new and important  light on the reconfiguration of divisions of labour presupposed by CE  visions and models, which includes the possibilities for their successful  realisation, and for unintended consequences. As the next section will  explore, this argument can be illustrated well through notions of the  ‘sharing economy’: a central focus of CE debates to date. focus of CE  debates to date.  3.2. The consumption work of the sharing economy  The ‘Sharing Economy’ is argued as playing a pivotal role in CE (e.g.  Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015) and for this reason, this paper uses it  as a key probe through which to explore the implications of CW within  CE. Here new practices and platforms deploy ‘underutilised assets,  monetised or not, in ways that improve efficiency, sustainability and  community’ . This can take the form of the  renting out of one’s spare rooms or properties , or  sharing surplus food in the local community (e.g. City Harvest London,  no date). Such initiatives are argued to potentially create 570 billion  Euros worth of transactions by 2025 , as well as fostering  novel forms of consumption and new emotional and motivational en- gagements , while creating environmental benefits  through reducing resource use (Bocken et al., 2017; Homrich et al., K. Hobson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Journal of Cleaner Production 321  128969 42018 ).  However, research has shown that some sharing initiatives do little  to address the social and sustainability issues they claim to overcome  . For example, research by Holmes   has illuminated how sharing endeavours, whilst temporarily  diverting some waste from landfill, can also see shared resources ulti- mately ending up there, with added CW for intermediaries. As such,  there is a need to cast a critical eye over the actual outcomes and impacts  of forms of sharing, including the role that new forms of CW play (e.g.  see Schor et al., 2016 ). And in further understanding the dynamics of CE  CW, there is arguably an important analytical distinction to be made  between access-based and ownership-based forms of CE consumption  practice, outlined in Table 1 below .  Access-based CE consumption is where ‘no transfer of ownership  takes place ’ . That is, goods can be  leased, which may involve individual and unlimited access (e.g. the  private leasing of a car); or limited and sequential access (e.g. joining a  car-sharing club); or pooling, which necessitates simultaneous access (e.  g. car-pooling with shared ownership) . By contrast,  ownership-based CE practices can involve sequential sharing, such as  passing along unwanted items from one owner to the next: or co-owning  assets such as housing co-ownership cooperatives. Although ‘individual  ownership ’ in Table 1 in reality falls outside the purview of SE, it does  form a key component of consumer-focused CE practices e.g. the care  and repair of owned goods to elongate product life spans (see Cooper,  2016 ). As such, Table 1 aims to capture various CE and sharing-related  spheres of practice such as the peer-to-peer economy, the second-hand  economy, the collaborative economy, and product-service systems, to  show examples of them in terms of consumer involvement.  All of the above practices require both distinct and overlapping forms  of CW. For practices in the Individual Ownership category of Table 1,  some argue they involve less CW by eliminating inconveniences caused  by the current poor quality and obsolescence of owned goods. That is:  ‘For the customer, overcoming premature obsolescence will signifi - cantly bring down total ownership costs and deliver higher convenience  due to avoiding hassles associated with repairs and returns ’. (Ellen  MacArthur Foundation, 2013 : 76).  At face value this statement appears unproblematic. However, little  is known about the CW involved in buying longer-lasting products: what  one assumes is being referred to in the phrase ‘overcoming premature  obsolescence ’. Studies that have explored this area argue that ‘product  lifetime optimisation ’ consumer behaviour —across the stages of prod- uct acquisition, use, and disposal —is  currently characterised by a lack of consumer knowledge and skills in  identifying longer-lasting products. In turn, research into specific con- sumer practices of product care   show that these require time, effort and competences, which can limit  the involvement of some individuals. For others however, new forms of  CW encourage participation, particularly when it is framed and felt as  challenge and/or fun .  As such, assuming longer-lasting products equate with less CW overall is  unproven and requires further scrutiny if it is to be a pillar of the CE. Claims of greater convenience are also made for the access-based  forms of SE. Influential multi-national consultancies such as PWC   and Deloitte  are amongst those who have underscored the  business gains to be had from CE including comments such as:  ‘The sharing economy is convenient for both the consumer and the  service provider. It  provides consumers with convenient and cost-efficient access to re- sources and to access various services with a few taps on their smart - phones ’ .  Forms of leasing, renting, borrowing or pooling that are facilitated  digitally are thus argued by advocates to relieve consumers from the  ‘burdens of ownership ’ . However, some  researchers have turned their attention to the ‘burdens of access ’ (Haz˘ee  et al., 2017 ). Here, research has found that while not having to repair,  maintain or buy new privately owned goods is looked upon favourably  by some, an equal number find it time consuming to borrow or rent  goods . There are also feelings of added re- sponsibility and at times anxiety about being in possession of non-owned  products, which some users feel a need to take greater  care of  .  In terms of sequential access, research on renting and borrowing has  identified various forms of CW that users need to do, along with how  these are experienced. For example, while car-sharing reduces the la- bour  of appropriating and caring for a car (Bardhi and Eck- hardt, 2012 ) there is notable planning and logistical work involved in  participating in car-sharing. This can include scheduling use of the car,  potentially re-arranging plans due to the relative inflexibility of car  sharing; returning the car; reporting issues with vehicles; and dealing  with dirty cars or low fuel (Fraanje and Spaargaren, 2019 ; Haz˘ee et al.,  2017 ). For other forms of peer-to-peer borrowing and renting, Philip  et al.  remark that:  ‘renters need to browse, find and request their wanted items, contact  the seller for available times and places to meet for pick-up and drop-off,  arrange payment, return the item in the same condition as originally  rented and also leave feedback for the provider ’.  In the above research, their participants lamented the efforts  required to take part in peer-to-peer sharing, leading the authors to  conclude that these forms of CW can be a major deterrent for users.  Fraanje and Spaargaren  also found, in a study of car-sharing  co-operatives, that many members found the social aspects encour - aged by the service-provider to be burdensome emotional labour,  preferring instead more impersonal consumption. Taken together, all of  the above research points towards much more going on under the sur- face of the ‘convenience ’/‘inconvenience ’ labels given to CW in the CE  to date. Indeed, accepting claims that the CE will ease CW burdens for  consumers cannot be taken at face value and thus require much closer  scrutiny, with the suggestion of a potential research agenda as such  detailed in the following section. s, that many members found the social  aspects, encouraged by the service-provider, as burdensome emotional  labour, preferring more impersonal consumption. Taken together, all of  the above research points towards much more going on under the sur- face of the ‘convenience ’/‘inconvenience ’ labels given to CW in the CE  to date. Indeed, accepting claims that the CE will ease CW burdens for  consumers can no longer be taken at face value, and thus require much  closer scrutiny, with the suggestion of a potential research agenda  detailed in the following section.  4.The circular economy and Consumption Work: a research  agenda  As the previous section outlined, research already offers some insight  into the importance of considering CW in the reconfiguration of con- sumers ’ practices as part of CE. Yet, more much information is still  needed, and this section sets out some key questions. For one, extant  knowledge of CE CW remains fragmented, in terms of both terminology  and empirical focus. Existing relevant research does explore the Table 1  Circular Economy and Sharing Economy modes of provision (from Wieser,  2019 ).   Consumption Individual Sequential Simultaneous  Access individual access (e.g.  product service  system, leasing, pay-  per use) sequential access  (e.g. renting,  borrowing) simultaneous  access (e.g.  pooling)  Ownership individual ownership  (e.g. product service  system repair,  maintenance, reduce) sequential  ownership (e.g.  second-hand, gift,  reuse, repeat  exchanges) simultaneous  ownership (e.g.  co-owning)  K. Hobson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Journal of Cleaner Production 321  128969 5demands of CE CW to some extent, often under the guise of different  concepts such as convenience, effort, domestic labour and/or co-  creation. However, these different concepts make it challenging to un- dertake direct comparisons between examples. As such, CW has thus far  not been studied systematically in the CE context, beyond Wheeler and  Glucksmann ’s research on domestic recycling . This is a notable  gap, as supposed benefits, like added convenience, represent an  important value proposition for CE proponents. And yet the actual work  consumers need to undertake, to invest in new practices compared to  traditional  modes of provision, remains under-explored. While  CE advocates make claims of ‘hassle-free ’ services, studies show there is  often significant effort required in doing repairs, purchasing second-  hand, or participating in peer-to-peer sharing. How these all add up to  helping create the ‘circular consumer ’  remains to be seen.  There are several areas of research that stem from the above point.  For one—while case studies of recycling, product service systems, and  sharing platforms make up the bulk of the literature —it is notable that  the practices of leasing, purchasing long-lasting products, co-ownership,  and pooling are understudied . This is a clear omission, as  many of these practices are heavily implicated in current CE debates and  policies. For example, the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy  considers prolonging product lifetimes as an important component of  the CE , exemplified in the 2019 ‘Right to  Repair ’ legislation, which is a part of this overall strategy (Ehgartner and  Hirth, 2019 ; Harrabin, 2019b ). Therefore, question here include what  forms of CW are involved in realising this goal; how are the prerequisites  for this work  currently distributed; and what  is needed, to address any barriers that additional CW might create for  consumers?  As well as particular practices that require further research, various  components of CW are also under-studied. For one, some consumer  engagements with the CE involve degrees of skill and creativity. While  research has shown these can be lacking in some areas — e.g. identifying  long-lasting products at the point of purchase —other research outlines  how experience over time enables consumers to feel confident and  competent in engaging with particular modes of consumption e.g. when  shopping at second hand markets . In addi- tion, CW can entail forms of emotional work that are only partially  explored in research to date. For one, some CE modes of provision  appear to make consumers feel obliged to take care of, and be respon - sible for, the condition of goods. One example can be found in a refillable  milk bottle scheme  where consumers took extra  care of, and felt some stewardship towards, the reused and returned  bottles even though this was not required for them to participate in the  service. However, other studies report the opposite effect i.e. consumers  taking less care with sequentially accessed goods (e.g. Bardhi and Eck- hardt, 2012 ). This suggests that more attention needs to be paid to  variations across different modes of provisioning, and in what ways  consumers  feel responsible for the goods that pass through  their hands, plus the impacts all of the above have on the take-up of new  practices.  One notable feature of the research to date has been how it often  examines one consumption practice at a time e.g. repairing goods,  renting goods, or participating in a new product service system. For  there to be a fuller understanding of the scope and changes to CW if the  CE is to become a domestic reality, there also needs to be explorations of  how CW is coordinated across household activities, along with the  temporal dimensions of such activities. We already know that the  adoption of one form of domestic practice can have (sometimes unde- sirable) knock-on effects on others e.g. more domestic recycling often  leads to less CW in other waste prevention behaviours in a household (e.  g. Cox et al., 2010 ). Yet, we do not currently know how potential con- flicts between competing CE solutions play out. Nor, how any conflicts  are, or are not, resolved amongst householders. Is there a ceiling to  consumers ’ participation in the CE? And if so, what combinations of CE  practices are tenable for what types of households? And what forms of supporting infrastructures are required to foster yet more engagement,  to the point where household emissions are brought down to the levels  recommended by the Committee on Climate Change ?  A key factor in addressing these questions are issues of divisions of  labour. This is an area rarely included in discussions of the CE but one  that the concept of CW is especially attuned to. Research on household  CW does show that there is an unequal distribution of labour, especially  in terms of the gendered division of domestic labour (e.g. see Glucks - mann, 2016 on recycling). However, there exists little knowledge about  if, and how, CE CW differs from established arrangements in terms of  domestic division of labour. In this respect, comparative research could  provide valuable insights. Such research could take account both the  gendered division of labour within CE CW activities, and how other  socio-demographic factors such as household make-up, class, employ - ment type/patterns, race and ethnicity all influence the uptake and  engagement of CE CW. In short, who is doing the CW; why; and; to what  affect?  Finally, there are questions of where and how to do CW research. For  one, there currently exists a limited range of extant and easily visible  form of consumption-based CE practice, which would allow researchers  to trace the requirements they make of consumers and their impacts. In  particular, while the uptake of singular CE activities is reasonably well-  documented , less is known  about how many households are undertaking multiple forms of CE  practice, which would enable questions of coordination to be addressed.  Furthermore, there is the methodological challenge of how to conduct  research on CW that forms part of private, domestic realms, that is often  habitual and conditioned by unarticulated norms (e.g. see Wonneck and  Hobson, 2017 ). Methodologically, such research has precedents in  ‘practice theory ’ research ,  which often deploys detailed qualitative, in situ approaches, utilising  small n samples to understand in detail the rationales and outcomes of  particular consumption practices . While  much of this work is descriptive of current practices, research into CE  CW would need to adopt a more action-research ethos (e.g. see Doyle  and Davies, 2013 ), wherein research happens alongside householders  experimenting in consciously changing their practices e.g. recruiting a  small sample of households to live like ‘circular citizens ’ for several  months .  Finally, research into CE CW needs to move beyond the domestic  sphere and space of the household, to consider engagement with  consumption-based practices in other spaces. This could be individuals  coming together once a month to participate in a local Repair Caf˘e, or  household engagements with community-based CE business models,  whether they are explicitly labelled as such. This is because some  consumer-based CE practices are not bound to the home, but are rather  implicated in establishing new patterns of, for example, mobility prac- tices: practices, which in turn, influence CE CW household dynamics.  5.Concluding comments  In reviewing the literature relevant to CE CW, two key findings stand  out. First, CE CW has so far not been studied systematically beyond  Wheeler and Glucksmann ’s research into recycling. Extant knowledge of  CE CW is therefore limited, fragmentary, and scattered throughout  studies framed through concepts such as ‘domestic labour ’ and ‘co-cre - ation ’, and looser terms such as ‘convenience ’ and ‘effort ’. Furthermore,  there are considerable gaps in CE literature, especially in relation to CW  involved in co-ownership, pooling, repeat exchanges, and avoidance of  packaging. Second, it is clear that forms of provisioning associated with  CE, including those most strongly associated with convenience, involve  significant CW. As noted, prevailing models of CE require the reconfi - guration of existing modes of CW (e.g. increased domestic recycling  activities) and/or the establishment of new forms of CW (e.g. repairing,  sharing): all of which are assumed, in the long-run, to make life easier or  at least more pleasant and socially connected for the consumer —an K. Hobson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Journal of Cleaner Production 321  128969 6assertion that is far from proven to date.  In response, this paper set out five, inter-related, critical issues that a  research agenda of CE CW must address. First is the importance of the  coordination of CW across household activities. For CE consumption  practices to be viable at the household level such CW coordination  would be vital. Given the paucity of examples of household CE activity,  understanding household CE CW is currently speculative, necessitating  innovative, action-oriented research. Second, there is clearly a complex  relationship between CW and consumption norms. For one, ‘conve - nience ’ has a central place in contemporary consumption expectations,  with its enhancement often assumed by CE advocates. Yet, the actual  CW involved in CE options —and well as consumers ’ willingness to off-  set convenience against other norms  —is  poorly understood. Third, and relatedly, CE CW involves degrees of  competence, skills and sometimes creativity. How these may be ac- quired, diffused and thus become routinized and habitual is an open  question. Fourth, research suggests that CW is often —but not  always —infused with an ethic of care—for material objects, others and/  or the environment. CE research must therefore pay attention to varia - tions across different modes of provision and populations, as to the ways  in which consumers are made to feel responsible and come to express an  ethics of care.  Finally, CW inherently concerns divisions of labour. There has been  little engagement in CE literature to date with how labour is being  moved along the supply chain in new forms of allegedly ‘circular ’  business models: and the implications for such shifts, in terms of what is  being expected of, and what is possible for, the consumer/user. Such  concerns must be central to a research agenda on CE CW, if any in- terventions are not to exacerbate already-existing inequalities or have  knock-on effects of increasing overall resource-use. In short, just as  energy-intensive processes are needed to sustain the material flows of  the CE, so it goes for some forms of labour: labour that sits behind, and  remains obscured by, headline assumptions such as those of increased  consumer convenience. Thus, to fully evaluate the core claims for the all-  round benefits of CE, understanding the complexities of CE CW needs to  be part of an enlarged and critical research agenda.
