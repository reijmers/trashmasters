electrical and electronic equipment WEEE Sustainable production and consumption Disposal Recycling Literature review ABSTRACT To tackle the alarming increase in ewaste or endoflife EoL electronic products consumer behavior towards the end of their useful life needs to be thoroughly studied End users or consumers are the starting point where e waste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy CE such as repair reuse remanu facturing and recycling Ewaste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of ewaste with household waste by consumers Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to achieve CE Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers ewasterelated knowledge and awareness and behavior on consumption disposal storage recycling and repair Substantial knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around ewaste may be integrated into the CE model This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing research papers published in international peerreviewed journals identified in the Web of Science WoS core collection database using content analysis methodology to analyze and review the articles The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a more consumercentric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and implementation strategies around ewaste This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer behavior around ewaste The study results show that consumers disposal and recycling behaviors are the two main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed In contrast reuse and repair behavior were investigated to a lesser extent In this study several research gaps and areas for future research are identified along with suggestions for a CE framework focusing on the ewaste sector that encompasses policy initiatives and business model innovations The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are starting to work on consumer behaviorrelated ewaste research Introduction The rapid technological revolution coupled with increasing demand among consumers for hightech products has triggered unprecedented levels of electrical and electronic equipment EEE consumption At this moment there are approximately different types of EEE found in the international market Forti et al Electronic waste ewaste or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE that EEE becomes at the end of its useful life poses a severe challenge to the environment as well as to human health due to the presence of highly toxic substances Balde et al Ewaste management EM is one of the most pressing problems for today s modern society Islam and Huda a with around million tons of ewaste generated worldwide in and levels escalating rapidly Forti et al Aside from reducing negative impacts improved management of e waste streams represents a lucrative opportunity due to the various precious and rare earth elements it contains Shumon et al The starting point for ewaste is consumers who determine its destination Corresponding author

such for ewaste management to improve understanding consumers behavior is central Saphores et al Parajuly et al identified that the consumer is one of the critical elements of the ewaste problem with demand growth for EEE consumers environmental awareness and behavior being key factors From the CE perspective four different paths are associated with con sumers which are maintainedprolonged use including sharing and repair reuse and distribution remanufacturerefurbishment and recycling Fig CE is an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design Ellen Macarthur Foundation Reverse supply chain RSC productservice design business models EoL re covery productservice use and policy are the CEs building blocks Ellen MacArthur Foundation According to Lieder and Rashid the definition is more comprehensive as it considers both the environmental and economic advantages simultaneously under the notion of regenerative performance requiring novel business models that enable the highquality circulation of technical material or nutrients and safe entry of bionutrients or regenerated materials into the bio logical sphere Consumers government policymakers charities private sector investors digital disruptors at a multinational or entrepreneurial level product manufacturers parts manufacturers service providers and stakeholders of recycling industries are the main actors in CE Ellen MacArthur Foundation Fig shows related factors central inner circle of a complex socioeconomic system and the building blocks of a CE According to Alamerew and Brissaud the blocks and factors interact in a relatively complicated manner requiring an interdisciplinary approach to solve problems In this case information on legal economic social business and environmental aspects are particularly critical Brissaud and Zwolinski In ewaste was first considered as a priority waste stream in Europe and in the European Union EU WEEE Directive was published Directive Parajuly and Wenzel argued that the ewaste stream possesses a high possibility for reuse and valuable ma terial recovery The Directive imposes strict obligations on producers regarding waste management under the Extended Producer Re sponsibility EPR system Horta Arduin et al More recently the EU CE action plan works towards closing the loop of product lifecycles through sustainable production and consumption and sound waste management EU Due to the diverse range of EEE products the EU categorized ewaste items into six different segments Table shows the categories sample products and legislative provisions of recovery reuse and recycling for the member states In recent times research related to consumers awareness of ewaste consumption storage disposal and recycling behavior has been gaining Fig Ewaste consumers and CE model adapted from MacArthur and Parajuly et al Fig Building blocks of CE Alamerew and Brissaud MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production attention among researchers worldwide Broadly consumer behavior focusing on ewaste can be categorized into several areas consumption storage repair and reuse RR disposal and recycling Bovea MD et al Knowledge and awareness about the formal collection system among consumers are also critical aspects that determine the sustainability of the system in the socioeconomic sphere Several studies such as the study by Islam et al a Ramzan et al Saphores et al and others emphasized the issue Ewasterelated policy management system architecture countryspecific consumer culture and behavior and availability of a diverse range of product categories in the market and their interaction with consumers create a complex phenomenon defining and connecting building blocks and definitions of circular economy with a sustainable ewaste management system Literature related to the consumer behaviors around ewaste is proliferating however no comprehensive review article is found that analyzed all the behaviors to spot the future research directions and developing a consumercentric circular economy framework focusing on ewaste This paper tries to eliminate such gaps by reviewing articles published between and March using content analysis meth odology The main research questions RQs of the article are RQ How do the issues related to consumer awareness and behavior with a particular focus on the ewaste sector contribute to the essential operational framework in achieving a CE RQ How can the general understanding contribute to informing policymakers and researchers in identifying future policy measures to be taken and the necessity of performing research studies in the area After reviewing articles published on consumer behavior around e waste in Section a consumercentric CE framework is proposed with policy implications and business model innovation under Section With this RQ was answered Based on the indepth literature review of the selected articles research gaps were identified proposing critical future research directions in Section by which RQ was addressed The research contributions of this review article are it provided a guide or reference for future researchers to accumulate all the infor mation and knowledge surrounding consumer behaviorrelated topics focusing on ewaste it attempted to propose measures achieving a circular economy more holistically from a framework perspective focusing on sustainable consumer behavior and ewaste In many cases published papers did not consider the CE concept into their central research theme focusing instead on various behavioral aspects The framework incorporated behaviorspecific aspects into CE pathways creating interdisciplinary research opportunities in the field besides presenting a quantitative assessment of the research progress in the field the article provided a transparent and replicable methodology which could also be utilized collecting materials from other available databases in this paper issues related to policy and business model innovation are discussed respectively which provide suggestions for both researchers and policymakers in systemlevel development and future research areas and on the research topic potential future research directions have been identified which could be useful for future researchers The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section dis cusses some earlier review articles Section describes the research methodology An indepth analysis of the literature is presented in Section Results and discussion are illustrated in Section Finally Section ends with the conclusion Literature review To clarify the need of this review article some of the previously published review articles worth mentioning Table provides details of the previous articles on the topic which also helped to perform a structured literature review based on the content analysis methodology Details of the methodology is described in Section Based on Table it is evident that in recent time no comprehensive literature review article has been published on all the consumers behavioral aspects focusing on ewaste Scopes of the articles also showed that consideration of various product types was not given in the previous review articles and issues were discussed more in the local context Thus a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding a holistic picture of consumers behavior around ewaste This is the first attempt at reviewing consumer awareness and behavior focused on e waste considering all the behavioral aspects to the best of the authors knowledge Research methodology According to EasterbySmith et al and Brocke et al a literature review plays a critical role in understanding and exploring a specific research field s structure New theory development and inves tigation scope could further progress the knowledge base by identifying a useful literature review Machi and McEvoy In this study the foursteps systematic literature review technique proposed by Mayring under the qualitative content analysis method is utilized Fig shows the four steps process model for the content analysis method consisting of material collection descriptive analysis category selec tion and material evaluation Mayring provided an extensive discussion on the method Previously several literature review articles have applied the research methodology to ewaste research eg Wati

considered Later public OR consumer OR consumers OR customer OR household OR resident OR residents keywords were input in the refine search box of the database that retrieved a total of articles As the studies need to have a primary survey component as part of the methodology the keyword survey was used in the refined search which delivered articles The search was performed on November Other criteria for selecting the articles were that the methodology section of the article must specify the sample size sam pling technique and the number of the valid samples of the participants In some cases a few studies identified through the search involved surveyed stakeholders other than consumers such as repair technicians in the study by Sabbaghi et al These were excluded from the selection as the group does not represent consumers Finally arti cles were found that focused only on consumers behavior around ewaste The articles collected in the materialcollection stage showed that authors had analyzed more than one issue in most cases For example PerezBelis et al investigated the secondhand pur chase and repair behavior of consumers focusing on small IT equipment in which they investigated consumption RR and disposal behavior altogether Table shows the article selection process for this review article Descriptive analysis The following subsections illustrate the analysis

the future One article had a publication year of as some journals publish online version first and volume and issue numbers are assigned in advance Distribution of research papers by subjectdiscipline Using the Web of Science WoS s Results analysis tools it was found that of the articles fell under the subject category of envi ronmental sciences which was the most prominent subject category Fig Other categories included engineering environmental green sustainable science technology environmental studies regional urban planning and business These results indicate that consumer behavior related to ewaste studies covers a diverse spectrum of discipline areas that demand an interdisciplinary study approach Countrywise article production Fig shows the geographical distribution of the studies in terms of the number of publications focusing on a specific country In the collection of the articles first author s affiliation and country were considered as the origin of the article China under the group of developing countries produced the highest number of articles pa pers until November and this number is higher than the number of papers published by some of the countries from developed nations such as the USA articles and Spain articles Malaysia papers India papers and Brazil papers were some of the other devel oping countries in which consumers behavior was studied Even though ewaste is a global environmental problem and consumer behavior is an important factor for ewaste impacts surprisingly consumer behavior was studied in relatively few countries For instance from Australia there are only two academic papers published on the issue in Product diversity in papers As consumer behavior varies substantially according to the cate gories of the products and specific

frequently considered followed by SE Distribution of research papers by methodology In terms of research methodology Fig the most frequent meth odology was statistical followed by theoretical analytical survey and case study The categorization made in this study is based on the types and characteristics of the tools and techniques applied to explain consumer behavior towards ewaste When studies performed or applied specific statistical methods tools and techniques those studies were considered under the category of statistical Specific methods and techniques categorized as statistical methodologies include Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA analysis of variance ANOVA Conjoint analysis Correlation analysis contingent ranking CR analysis Spearman correlation analysis Correspondence analysis various regression models such as logistic regression Multi nomial logistic regression MLR ordered logit regression model extended ordered probit model Poisson regression model

While all the papers selected for this review article involved survey to some extent studies were classified within the survey category if they were performed using any market research methodology such as the Contingent Valuation Method CVM a surveybased economic technique that was implemented mainly for assessing consumers will ingness to pay This survey category was created to separate these research methodologies from others that were more statistical theo retical analytical or case study focused Approaches that fall under the case study category include quasiethnographic approaches direct waste analysis and word of mouth research methodologies When cross cultural and crosscountry studies were performed then those were considered as case studies Theory of Planned Behavior TPB is one of the dominant theories used in the analysis technique coupled with structural equation modeling SEM SEM is a combined statistical technique consisting of multiple regression path analysis and factor analysis Ajzen first postulated the TPB and later several extended versions of the theory have been implemented in marketing research This evolved out of the Theory of Reasoned Action which states that intentions are the best predictors of behaviors The central premise of TPB is that something is more likely to be done if there is a plan to do it According to TPB in tentions are the product of three different processes behavioral at titudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control Papers that applied TPB particularly in ewasterelated consumer behavior research are presented in the Appendix in Table A and the primary constructs and their interrelations are shown in Fig A Overall it was identified that a diverse range of tools methods and techniques have been applied which indicates that these methods could be part of the tools and techniques specific factor explaining the cir cular economy principles at least in relation to consumer behaviors and perspectives on ewaste These results also showed that an interdisci plinary approach is required for proposing new solutions andor theory development in the research areas Primary data collection and analysis techniques As mentioned earlier in the selection criteria of the papers to be included in this article a study must contain a survey component in its research methodology After analyzing the data collection technique DCT of the papers Fig it is found that facetoface interviews FTFI were implemented by of the articles followed by paper based surveys PBS and online surveys Approximately of the articles mentioned that a survey was performed but did not explicitly mention any specific DCTs In some cases multiple DCTs were also observed for instance around of the articles used both PBSs and FTFIs Category selection The main categorization of the content of this article and the research framework is presented in Fig As mentioned in the material collection section the literature is classified into six major research typescategories These six categories are knowledge awareness and familiarity about formal ewaste collection and recycling systems consumption behavior CB storage behavior SB RR behavior disposal behavior DB and recycling behavior RB The distribution of the research articles for six different categories is shown in Fig with details of individual papers in Table

less commonly studied which illustrates the need for Fig Distribution of research papers by subject categories Fig Geographical distribution and number of articles published by the countries MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production future exploration of these areas Material evaluation Using inductive and deductive approaches simultaneously two re searchers performed a validity test as the last part of the content analysis process The reliability of the content was measured by both intrarater reliability and interrater reliability After the material collection all necessary data have been extracted as per categories and subcategories identified by the researchers and input in a Microsoft Excel spread sheet to avoid repetition error In the WoS database the same keywords were utilized to search articles producing similar results with the cor rect articles This is how reliability was established Over time a few articles were added to the database NVivo version plus was utilized in some places identifying specific content and subsequent analysis and for crossreferencing purposes This is how the validity of the content has been achieved Indepth analysis of the literature In this section multiple topics have been analyzed based on the collection of the articles In section articles that discussed con sumers perceptions and understanding regarding ewaste and ewaste collection and recycling system were analyzed In Section various consumer behaviors were comprehensively analyzed For example in Section consumption behavior related studies were highlighted while Section and Section disposal and repair and reuse related behavioral issues were compiled respectively Section was dedicated to analyzing consumers recycling behaviorrelated studies The overall mapping of the sections and subsections of the analysis is shown in Fig Consumers knowledge and awareness regarding ewaste and familiarity of collection and recycling system Response from the consumers regarding what ewaste is and the negative health impact of ewaste fell under the category of general awareness and these specific questions were investigated by around Fig Major ewaste considered in the papers A product in and B category according to EU WEEE Directive in MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production of the articles Rather than developed countries this issue was mainly highlighted in the articles published from the developing coun tries Associated issues that come under the category of consumers knowledge and awareness are analyzed in the subsequent subsections Understanding and perceptions of ewaste Generally mature adult consumers consider ewaste to create negative environmental impacts Afroz et al Similar result was identified by Siringo et al and Tan et al Even young consumers in Australia had the same perception Islam et al b Same phenomenon was identified for the Chinese young people in the study of Ramzan et al However Borthakur and Govind mentioned that level of awareness related to potential harmful impact of ewaste on environment was found substantially low Similar result was shown research conducted by Awasthi and Li Ravindra and Mor and Saritha et al On the other hand sometimes people do not consider ewaste as dangerous and toxic Pandebesie et al Lack of information related to ewaste was found to be one of the critical aspects that need to be disseminated Gok et al as often ewaste recyclingrelated activities and consumers role is unclear understood as complicated and timedemanding task This scenario prevails both in developing and developed countries for example by Saphores et al in the USA where the authors found that con sumers were unwilling to transfer the waste to proper recycling facil ities Limited ewaste toxicity knowledge often creates barriers adopting environmentfriendly products Darby and Obara mentioned that consumers demanded more information on where they can recycle their small WEEE instead why they should recycle In an ewaste takeback system lack of awareness insufficient information and sociodemographic factors eg age gender significantly affect con sumers motivation to return ewaste Botelho et al There are also other behavioral factors associated with the motiva tion to adopt environmentfriendly practices and Siringo et al found that moral norms environmental beliefs and social pressure significantly affect performing or willingness to perform appropriate activities such as recycling Liu et al even urged for a funda mental change in the environmental awareness and behavior Environ mental beliefs largely influence willingness to pay WTP to develop a sustainable EM system even if recycling convenience is limited Nixon et al Nguyen et al mentioned that enduser s willingness to participate in recycling programs laws and regulations inconve nience of recycling and experience were four key factors that indicated WTP for ewaste recycling Adequate environmental knowledge could lead to stronger environmental belief and Saphores et al found that environmental knowledge was a significant predictor of WTP for environmentally friendly products Several authors suggested that con sumers awarenessraising programs should be organized Saritha et al Lack of ewasterelated awareness the consequences Due to lack of knowledge informal sector collectors and recyclers got an advantage and became more influential For example Islam et al found that of the households preferred to sell their ewaste items to local scrap collectors or even throwing ewaste with household waste Pasiecznik et al s study indicated that of respondents mostly young consumers did so as well For a formal system devel oped and prepared as per environmental guidelines weak environ mental protection awareness and limited knowledge of recycling channels results in a low collection rate which is a loss in investment Lowlevel of awareness could also influence personal beliefs For example Fraige et al found that of consumers believed that they could dispose of WEEE with household waste Productspecific waste collection for instance in the case of waste mobile phone WMP recycling low awareness levels and inadequate recycling abil ities were considered as main obstacles Liu et al Furthermore hibernating behavior storing ewaste could evolve due to little ewaste knowledge Storing ewaste at home is a general practice which is nothing but stockpiling material resources in the whole supply chain or the built environment Borthakur and Govind Bai et al particularly mentioned that perception regarding resource conservation effort which was not wellrecognized needs to be more understood by the consumers Familiarity of collection and recycling programs The familiarity of the formal collection and recycling system CRS is critical for a system s overall longterm sustainability Often such awareness especially location of the nearest ewaste collection points was found limited Cao et al Similar result was found research by Borthakur and Govind Gu et al and Ravindra and Mor Despite the presence of some level of ewasterelated knowledge among consumers sometimes the awareness of the existence of any ewaste recovery programs in a region or city was found limited For example Awasthi and Li found the issue for case of Bangalore India Deng et al for Hong Kong China and Islam et al b for Sydney Australia Environmental consciousness among young uni versity students is expected to be higher than the general population as Fig Distribution of research methodologies of the selected articles Fig Data collection techniques of the articles MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production seen by Dhingra and Maheshwari and Ramzan et al and Islam et al b Publicizing information regarding formal CRSs was found to be critical in several studies Cai et al Similar conclusion was found for South Korea by Park et al China by Yin et al and Finland by YlaMella et al On the other hand Wang et al disagreed with such argument for the residents of Shandong Province China Due to the lack of appropriate information regarding collection points Colesca et al found that of the respondents dispose of their ewaste via other pathways such as landfills Information dissemination on the collection schedule was also critical Nowakowski Miner et al mentioned that communitybased interventions to improve awareness levels have significance Dagili utle et al mentioned that despite selfreported aware ness consumers were not familiar with the various classifications of ewaste category of EEE under the national EM of Lithuania Among the various categories of ewaste SE has a relatively shorter lifespan and Echegaray found that the products expected lifespan decreases with the electronic device s portability Cao et al concluded that most consumers could not differentiate between formal and informal sector ewaste collection channels Chi et al mentioned that despite the higher economic benefits of oldfornew OFN collection schemes of respondents in their survey did not know about the price differences with other collection channels Martinho et al mentioned that environmental consciousness existed among Portuguese consumers however due to a lack of knowledge about recycling campaignsprograms such moderately familiar aspects failed to capitalize on the higher collection and recy cling rate of waste tablets and MPs Impact of socioeconomic factors on consumers ewaste knowledge and awareness In India Singh et al found that respondents with higher educational qualifications had higher awareness about ewaste Similar results were also found by Shaikh et al in Pakistan Nowakowski identified the factor as influential in Poland Islam et al a found that age household size and income were significantly associated with recycling program familiarity while Milovantseva and Saphores a found gender and age Regional distribution of EEE use and gender are vital attributes to a successful ewaste management system EMS Bhatt et al found that most women from Delhi and NOIDA were more cognizant of the environmental issues related to ewaste Miner et al mentioned that respondents sociodemographic characteristics had no significant influence on the levels of awareness knowledge and willingness to participate in the EM programs and extended producer responsibility schemes Awareness improvement techniques Arain et al suggested that ewaste educational campaigns should inform consumers on what constitutes ewaste and why it is essential to ensure proper recycling Saphores et al mentioned that providing education to young people and making ewaste sites convenient similar to the curbside collection program for other recy clable products for older people were crucial aspects of participants willingness to recycle Song et al mentioned that despite general Fig Categorization and research framework of the studies Fig Distribution of research articles for different categories MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production hazard perceptions among consumers regarding ewaste educational campaigns should be promulgated specifically for reuse and recycling Environmental protection and resource conservationrelated education should be given at an early stage creating recycling habits Jafari et al contend that the focus of awarenessraising campaigns should be on college students higherincome households and married residents Young consumers in a developing country such as China believe that EM is a shared responsibility of different stake holders including consumers the government manufacturers and sellers Ramzan et al Huang et al also found that re spondents are willing to share environmental responsibilities around ewaste in China and similar perceptions exist amongst Australian consumers Islam et al b Kumar mentioned an opportu nity to influence and propagate proenvironment behavior amongst young adults through university programs Table S presented in the SI shows various solution techniques proposed by the reviewed articles authors improving consumer awareness Consumer behaviors Various consumers behaviors were analyzed in the selected articles The articles were categorized into five different consumer behavior types as shown in Fig consumption storage disposal repairreuse and recycling which are discussed in the following subsections Analyzing consumers consumption behavior Consumption behavior was one of the significant topical issues researched by over of the selected articles Measurements applied to understand behavior included the number of appliances in house holds average ownership of household appliances average lifespan of EEE reasons for replacing EEE and frequency of replacement Factors affecting consumption behavior are discussed below including growing device penetration rate source of device acquisition factorsrelated to purchase decision devicespecific product ownership reasons and trend of device replacement and product lifespan A detailed summary table of the consumers consumptionrelated studies is presented in Table S in the article s SI In the last column of the table category articles were mapped according to their discussion area Growth of device penetration rate the reasons The consump tion of AC is influenced by climatic conditions to a greater degree than other products such as PCs including DCs and laptops TV sets re frigerators and WMs Cai et al Similar result was found by Chung et al for Hong Kong and by Song et al for Macau During the Christmas season consumption of electrical and electronic toys increases PerezBelis V et al On the other hand new government initiatives in ICT knowledge and skill dissemination pro gram showed a positive trend in higher device usage Rodrigues et al Rodrigues et al also identified that the government incentive program accelerated computers and printers penetration rate in Brazil The major contributing factors to high penetration and replacement rates were the rapid economic growth of a country Bhatt et al the income of growing consumer segments and the competitive market for electronic products Shaikh et al affordable fastpace technological innovation and price Arain et al local manufacturing base Afroz et al everincreasing consumer demand Cai et al and poor electronic repairability coupled with shorter product lifespan Arain et al Hightech device penetration such as PCs now becomes an indicator of a citys economic and cultural development Li et al Among large equipment the most consumed products are washing machines air conditioners and refrigerators Cai et al Chi et al mentioned that except for mobile phones per capita consumption for large equipment was higher than small equipment such as camcorders and printers On the other hand a high device replacement rate in dicates consumption patterns and future EG Fraige et al Fig Sections and subsections of indepth literature review MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production Factorsrelated to purchase decision Consumers prefer to buy cheap nonbrand electronics despite a shorter lifespan Othman et al Comparative price Gok et al and warranty period brands and installment facilities Islam et al were also found as critical criteria during product purchase Recommendations from friends and store promotion were some of the motivating factors behind purchasing decisions Afroz et al On the other hand Huang et al found that launching of new products with more powerful designs and extended capacity and the increasing purchasing power were the main reasons for new product purchase Some studies introduced a hypothetical green product to assess consumers WTP or willingness to buy WTB For example both Nnorom et al populated the concept of green phones that do not contain any hazardous substances and can be disposed of with regular household solid waste Similar research was conducted by Milovantseva in the USA The products purchase and use in tentions were found to be positive despite discrepancies about extra money Saphores et al The primary enablers for green product purchase and WTP for such products were environmental attitude improving local environment Huang et al resource money or wealth Nnorom et al ease of use Nnorom et al and product ecolabeling Sheoran and Kumar Milovantseva found that consumers who had a positive attitude towards recycling small electronics had significant environmental beliefs Importance of environmental product labeling was critical especially for informed decisionmaking of the consumers Bovea M et al Tu et al found that brand recognition service quality usage period and perceived prices are the most significant characteristics of iPhone as a MP brand For purchase motivation recognition and brand advantage were the factors In contrast recognition brand advantage and service quality were essential factors for brand loy alty and perceived price was necessary for purchase intention Au thors also found that female respondents were more inclined towards recognition brand advantage and perceived price than their male counterparts Simultaneously the level of income was the critical socioeconomic variable for the factor perceived price The factor also influenced the consumers purchase intention Bai et al reported that consumers tended to purchase mobile phones more frequently and the service life of mobile phones was decreasing dramatically with phones most commonly purchased brand new through official channels Echegaray and Li et al showed variable ownership levels for different appliances with MPs having the highest percapita consumption and DCs the lowest for Brazil and China respectively Similarly Araujo et al observed that mobile phone ownership was higher than other LE such as WMs ACs and SE such as tablets and DCs In India Borthakur and Govind that the number of the outofuse mobile phone was equal to or higher than the number of inuse mobile phones Bai et al identified that more than two MPs were possessed by the majority of the consumers in China Martinho et al identified that smartphone usage is higher than tablets in Portugal Consumers with high income and education tended to acquire more hightech equipment such as MPs plasma TV sets PCs and ACs Cao et al Similar trend was observed by Song et al for China as well and for Vietnam by Nguyen et al General productfocused trend Rodrigues et al found that the device acquisition possession period was higher for white goods but smaller for SE and screen categories Zhang L et al mentioned that product functionality is shifting towards more portable devices eg DCs functions could be replaced by tablets and laptops and digital cameras by mobile phone A stationary device such as a PC requires fewer updates among the students Borthakur and Govind identified that between computers and MPs the latter is replaced more frequently than the first one among the Indian consumers For example within years MPs were replaced and for computers it was every years Beyond four years none of the devices were used Reasons for device replacement The reasons for product replacement could be broadly categorized as malfunction technological obsolesce and demand for additional features Sabbaghi and Behdad Consumers perceived obsolescence is characterized by physical and technological obsolescence The first two reasons were more evident in European developed countries and the last one is seen from the developing country s context Furthermore due to demand for addi tional features the product itself became obsolete and in that case replacing a new item was the only option that consumers had Wieser and Troger revealed that perceived obsolescence is the primary motivation for mobile phone replacements and the defective device was the main reason for replacement Perceived obsoleteness was the main reason for replacement rather than desire for a new phone Logics of technological change and fashion were the determinants of replacement Articles discussing for product replacement identified multiple rea sons which varied between products The fast advancement of tech nology function and application availability was critical for MPs Bai et al Among the various reasons broken down malfunctioning devicedamaged was found as the main reason for device replacement regardless of the product types Such trend was observed among consumers from different parts of the world For example in India by Borthakur and Singh in Australia by Islam et al a and Islam et al b in Portugal by Martinho et al in Nigeria by Miner et al in UK by Ongondo and Wil liams in Spain by PerezBelis et al in Brazil by Rodrigues et al in Pakistan by Shaikh et al finally in China by Tan et al and Yin et al Pandebesie et al discovered that the unstable electrical voltage was the main reason for products malfunctioning in Indonesia It is a common phenomenon in developing countries Among the other secondary reasons lack of accessories of SE PerezBelis et al upgrade from network operator Martinho et al longer battery life Miner et al fashionable music storage picture storage for MPs Ongondo and Williams new system requirements by software applications for DCs Islam et al old design not powerfulnot enough capacity Afroz et al and backdated functionalities Shaikh et al stolen Liu et al lost Tan et al completely destroyed Tan et al service lifetime exceeded Tan et al market introduction of newer designs Miner et al influences by others eg through advertisement friends and trend Afroz et al were found critical among consumes Distribution of the reasons for replacement is shown in Fig In some studies fashion pursuit Cao et al and additional and more advance technological features Afroz et al were selected as the main reason for device replacement Borthakur and Singh found that consumers tended to buy new phones even though their old phone is still working For mobile phones fashion Yin et al and social status Shaikh et al were found as the two critical driving force of the new product consumption behavior Similar behavior was observed for other small equipment such as for MPMP players Cai et al and for notebooks Rodrigues et al Such high device replacement rates can indicate future EG Arain et al On the other hand Shaikh et al mentioned that con sumers from Pakistan tended to buy new EEE due to their needs not for luxury regardless of the new product introduction in the market Factors affecting device replacement Ongondo and Williams found that among the various parts of a mobile phone replacing batteries was the most frequent activity among students for which the device was replaced New device purchases do not necessarily depend on products being malfunctioned instead consumers demand improved quality or capacity Echegaray identified that technical failure MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production serves as a proxy indicator for product obsolescence and this is observed as a tangible reality for all individuals Milovantseva and Saphores a found that getting a more recent model is their primary moti vation for replacement in the case of MPs Replaced phones were still in working condition and hold economic value Nowakowski mentioned that the time to replace LE is higher than SE Jayaraman et al found that computer literacy had a significant moderation effect on laptop usage If a user has a relatively high knowledge of using laptops then there is a high probability that device replacement would occur after active use Perspectives of young consumers Ongondo and Williams identified that young consumers age was not associated with the fre quency of mobile phone replacing and the number of phones stockpiled by students Islam et al b found that the number of items in use laptops television sets and DCs were significantly associated with age income and household size of young consumers in Australia Around of the students changed their MPs every year Besides device fail ure mobile phone replacement because of the upgrades from network operators was dominant and this should be considered the planned obsolescence The young consumers lifestyle was found responsible for the shorter lifespan of MPs or the damage of the phones Although limited a small proportion of the students changed their MPs due to fashion pursuit Wieser and Troger found that the definition of uptodatedness of a mobile phone varied For example old re spondents perceived that their MPs were not technologically or aesthetically obsolete opposite to the young Productlifespan Product lifespanrelated articles are summa rized in Table Overall product lifespan is a critical parameter that is generally used to estimate EG Furthermore for a similar product the reported value of product lifespan may provide a tentative international comparison for future studies and define that product s lifespan profile Table shows the lifespan of various ewaste items Analyzing consumers storage behavior After useful life of an EEE consumers tend to store the equipment at households before it reaches to collection points or the household bin especially for small WEEE items such as MPs Although this issue is crucial and considered a significant barrier for potential acquisition for collection and recycling Nowakowski very few studies focused on this specific topic around of the articles The number of items stored at households storage time before disposal and reason for storage were critical aspects that were used by the articles identifying consumers storage behavior Summary of the storage behavior related studies is presented in Table S in SI of this article General trend of device storage In Switzerland Thiebaud et al found similar storage behavior for almost all types of electronic products The study also found that a vast amount of the products was stored and reused before reaching the collection scheme In Lithuania Dagili utle et al found that approximately of respondents stored obsolete EEE which later transferred to the collection points In Poland Nowakowski found that computer accessories and other information technology equipment were frequently stored by house holds by over of the respondents For MPs this was found above Another study by Nowakowski identified that SE stored per household was while mediumsized equipment was stored one item per two households In Ireland Casey et al identified that small ewaste items are generally existing in less visible and more fluid states due to the understanding of lying somewhere in the house on shelves and in drawers which resulted in addressing ewaste differently than other recyclable materials Ongondo and Williams observed that there is at least one mobile phone stockpiled for every student working out the average in the UK Martinho et al addressed that smartphones have a higher reuse potential than tablets in the overall storage behavioral pattern of Portuguese consumers In China Zhang L et al found that students storage behavior was predominant of the respondents Tan et al found that of residents stored their MPs among the participants while only disposed of their WMPs in the formal collection facil ities Bai et al estimated that WMP stored at home was per person and over the years and surprisingly it was observed that con sumers became conservative in giving out their used phones to the recycling channels In Brazil Rodrigues et al found that more than half of the respondents intended to maintain outofuse EEE where small EEE products were stored the most compared to large EEE as limited space is required Dominant stored products The top hibernated products were MPs Blake et al and laptops Ramzan et al followed by DC Singh et al mobile chargers Bovea MD et al computer mouse Shaikh et al hairdryers Pandebesie et al digital cameras Pandebesie et al refrigerators Singh et al DVD players Singh et al CRT TV sets Singh et al Regarding MPs storage similar trend was shown by Pandebesie et al in Indonesia Ramzan et al in China and Shaikh et al in Pakistan Singh et al found that both MPs and laptops were the top hibernated products in India Now akowski found that both MPs and their chargers were the main stored items in Poland On the other hand in Brazil mobile chargers and digital cameras were widely stored electronic product Rodrigues et al Motivating factors behind storage behavior Top cited reasons for storing old devices found in the studies are shown in Table These include barriers to recycling such as cost and inconvenience as well as the benefits of keeping devices such as spare parts data retention or to give to other people Martinho et al found that most respondents prefer to keep ewaste items smartphones and tablets at home instead of recycling Optimistic consumers attitudes were identified for reusing the products Islam et al a concluded that the lack of familiarity with a recy cling program is critical for the observed WMP storage behavior Wieser and Troger concluded that emotional attachment to the phones due to data and information and the phones qualities made consumers not dispose of it in any other means Besides consumers thought their Fig Top reasons for device replacement MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production kept phone would be used by someone instead of deliberately delivering it to the recycling channel In this process reusing the phone with a regular interval was common In a crosscultural study MiliutePlepiene et al found that social norms are the most crucial factor in storing ewaste in Lithuania s earlystage recycling system this did not apply to the case of Sweden Informationdata security was the principal reason for storing MPs Blake et al mentioned that consumers tended to keep their de vice as a sparebackup as it may have a monetary value Similar reason was identified by Shaikh et al Bovea MD et al iden tified that ebook readers GPS navigators or radio alarm clocks were stored because they could be used in the future as spare parts Singh et al identified that consumers often do not have or do not know about the dumping or resale opportunities of the discarded EEEs which triggered storage habits Qu et al mentioned that little knowl edge on hazard and contamination of ewaste coupled with preserving memories motivated device hibernation behavior Mitigating measures against storage Rodrigues et al found that storage behavior could be changed by implementing recy cling policies reverse logistic systems environmental education and incentives for social participation Casey et al reported that charity campaigns and life transition circumstances such as moving and renovation could be internal and external triggers respectively against hibernating behavior Ongondo and Williams found that takeback services could encourage students not to hoard more than one extra phone but some students may not participate even with knowledge of such schemes Greater a awareness of the environmental value the importance of recycling to reclaim the resources embedded within the phone could increase participation Arain et al concluded that consumers awareness of stewardship responsibilities and lowering the personal cost to recycle could be determining factors behind reducing storage habits Zhang L et al contend that university students stockpile large and increasing amount of personal electronics unless economic in centives are given Pierron et al found that in a student ac commodation setting students were not interested storing as there is limited space and alternatives recycling discarding reusing selling are now more readily available than previously This finding is different from others where in most cases consumers wanted to store their de vices at home Nowakowski concluded that for developing countries storing and later reusing is expected behavior The situation becomes intensified when the purchase price of the product is significantly higher such as Table Summary of product lifespanrelated articles Discussion focus Reference Summary MPs Abbondanza and Souza MPs are the fastest growing ewaste items than CRT monitors refrigerators and freezers and CRT TVs Cai et al On average consumers use MP for h per day Borthakur and Singh Although the potential life span of a mobile phone is around ten years the presentday scenario is such that people will not use their phone longer Bhatt et al Consumers in different parts of India is also changing their MPs in years Thiebaud et al MPs service life is often connected to mobile phone contracts Consumers expected service life for MPs was four years while MPs became obsolete no longer in use after three years Liu et al The lifespan of MPs was considerably shorter than the technical life expectancy and reduced from years to year within the analyzed period Cai et al MPs service life is longer than the average life that included storage time Jayaraman et al Modular repair work for example a broken screen of a mobile phone could extend the product lifespan Ongondo and Williams Network operators motivations and management strategies were identified as one of the undiscovered investigations with operator promoting a culture of quick new technology obsolescence and product upgrades with this seen as necessary for network providers to retain consumers Comparison between small and LE Botelho et al Cao et al Chi et al Echegaray and Hansstein Ravindra and Mor Small IT equipment such as MPs digital camcorders has a shorter lifespan consumers changed every years than screens and LE such as TV sets WM and refrigerators Nowakowski The average lifespan for refrigerators was higher than for TV sets and WMs Islam et al Frequent repairing for refrigerators and TV sets was an economic burden for consumers but essential to reach consumers expected product lifespan rather than extend product lifespan most EEE used by the households were phased out within the product lifespan and devices were updated within twothirds of the products designed lifespan TV sets and computers were notable the average lifespan of devices was three years and old portable electronic devices have been replaced three times within the device ownership period Factors associated with product lifespan Zhang L et al The product lifespan of SE is shorter among university students than the general population Shaikh et al Lifespan of flat panel television routers and modems laptops notebooks and tablets were higher among women Echegaray Individuals past experiences with products falling short of a reasonable lifetime should relate to the informed decision making of consumers expectations and specific product durability Pandebesie et al EEEs lifespan depends on the quality of the goods rather than the availability and quality of electricity Product lifespan an indicator for future planning Abbondanza and Souza Efficiency and efficacy of a takeback system largely depend on local data on product lifespan required for future policy planning especially location and capacity of WEEE dismantling units and WEEE collection routing Chung et al Regional data on product lifespan data is incredibly useful and lifespanrelated data collection methods should be more efficient and accurate Gok et al Service life of product is inversely proportional to the quantity of EG Yin et al Product service life is directly associated with energy and resource use MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production smartphones This overall scenario influences consumers discarding decisions Improvement of WEEE returns convenient methods is a crucial factor enhancing the collection rate for recycling of stockpiled ewaste Dagili utle et al found that consumers tended to repair their MPs if they were malfunctioning and if the operation is economi cally feasible otherwise the phones were stored or to a limited extent threw with household municipal waste Storage period Milovantseva and Saphores b found that storing waste TV sets for up to years was evident in American households where the number of sets was one or more Kurisu et al determined that PCs were disposed of within one year of storage However of PCs were hibernated for more than ten years Islam et al a found that the average storage time years for MPs is similar for Swiss and Australian consumers Results on hiber nating time showed that all types of personal electronics have been retained for less than years with the longest retaining time close to years for DCs Zhang L et al Socio economic factors Milovantseva and Saphores b found that proenvironmental behavior in the past months age ed ucation household size marital status the gender of the head of household type of dwelling and geographic location was strongly associated with the junk TVs storage among American households The authors also identified that larger households are more likely to have more junk TVs while the converse was true when household income increases Furthermore the consumers geographical locations impacted waste TV storage behavior and in that case the age of the sets was equal or greater than years old Dagili utle et al indicated that age has a positive association with storage For example due to limited purchase power students tended to use the products as spares Another study by Saphores et al identified that except for knowledge of ewaste and income all other explanatory variables age marital and employment status ethnicity household size previous ewaste recy cling behavior and to some extent education homeownership and understanding the consequences of recycling were found significant indicators describing the households ewaste storage behavior Pandebesie et al found that storage behavior is affected by the consumers residential conditions Arain et al mentioned that attaining a certain level of education alone is not sufficient to eliminate storage behavior and lack of knowledge among consumers regarding disposal options such as the location of proper facilities and concerns regarding personal data security the main reasons for storage Qu et al reported that of all residents had more than one WMP stored at home while of them had more than four WMPs One of the apparent reasons behind this was high disposable income Mar tinho et al found that consumers with large household sizes and high education levels were keener keeping broken smartphones in the home in the absence of preferred discountscashback method Measurement perspective Rodrigues et al found that at the center of the EG estimation method the portion related to storage or donation could often result in overestimations due to incorrect idea of immediate substitution of product Repressed demand is expected to Table Reported product lifespans in years of various EEE as ewaste Ref Country Product lifespan in years CRT

al a Australia MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production implement reverse logistics systems which is often hampered by the storage habit Singh et al mentioned that the storage of dis carded EEEs is a problem in quantification and recycling Casey et al found that keeping household items can be divided into two main categories disused or broken and abandoned In both cases over time the value of stored items dissipates which is often more trouble some than recycling or discarding it Analyzing consumers disposal behavior When consumers finally decide to dispose of unwanted EEE many options are generally available to them It could be formal disposal paths arranged and managed by government authorities or informal collection services managed by local scrap metal recyclers paddlers waste col lectors etc The second practice is widely used in developing countries where recycling is done by a crude process such as acid leaching Identifying disposal pattern is one of the significant issues of con sumers behavior that can provide valuable information on the existing ewaste collection system and opportunities to improve it This issue was investigated in most of the articles of the articles In the following subsections issues related to consumers disposal behavior are reviewed Table S in the SI provides indepth details of each of the articles at the country level highlighting the main research problems identified in the articles Mode of disposal Fig shows the top disposal methods identified by the articles reviewed Overall store at home is found as the most common disposal method but is typically temporary as discussed previously The reason was identified by the of the article Some of the corresponding studies mentioning this top disposal method were research performed by Borthakur and Govind in India for computer and MPs Chi et al in China for various small and large electronic equipment Islam et al a in Australia for MPs Martinho et al in Portugal for smartphones and tablets Miner et al in Nigeria for ewaste in general Ongondo and Williams in UK for MPs Shaikh et al in Pakistan for screen and IT equipment category Siringo et al in Indonesia for large and IT equipment category Wieser and Troger in Austria for MPs and Zhang L et al in China for personal IT equipment Besides the top methods shown in Fig some other notable methods of ewaste disposal were identified which are presented in Table Indepth details of the studies are given in Table S in the SI of this review article Depending upon the types and socioeconomic conditions of con sumers ewaste flows at different channels For example Song et al mentioned that people from less developed areas preferred to give MPs to friends relatives and other organizations while waste ACs and PCs were sent to manufacturers On the other hand Bovea MD et al found that I threw it in the trash and I replaced it with another type of appliance were the primary method and reasons for disposal respectively for SE For DCs collection by manufacturers and at electronic retail stores were standard practices in Japan Kurisu et al Delivering ewaste to various recycling channels existed a practice among consumers For example Wang et al mentioned that of residents used various recycling channels discarded Product lifespan in years Ebook readers Desktop computer Laptops Hard disks drive Global positioning system navigators GPS Radio alarm clocks RAC Electrical toys Iron Fluorescent lamp Heater Toaster Vacuum Cleaner Sandwich makers Kettles Hair Dryer Headset Large loudspeakers Rice cooker DVD player F F MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production ewaste with municipal waste while stored ewaste at home Although there was a high percentage of users using recycling channels it is believed that informal sector ewaste collectors are one of them For example Ongondo and Williams found that selling is happening among consumers companies or individuals Singh et al found that most consumers disposed of their ewaste to informal ewaste col lectors and recyclers Chi et al in China found the same Informal sector ewaste disposal practice was considered as loss of energy and resources due to its unfriendly recycling nature Ramzan et al Despite the fact Borthakur and Govind found I sell them to the scrap dealers or kawariwalas as one of the disposal paths from where consumers got benefits A similar result was found by Abbondanza and Souza Donation is often considered as a gift from the donors Ongondo and Williams It is a product lifespan extension process that reduces EG Rodrigues et al Lau et al mentioned the entity of donation as donated to nonprofit making organizations PerezBelis V et al concluded that besides the consumers who donate used toys to family or charities around of the con sumers dispose of their fractions of waste toys in domestic bins while of the respondents used recycling points Nowakowski mentioned that improper disposal practices existed among residents and many of the residents disposed of ewaste with household solid waste and selling the item to local scrappers In Malaysia Othman et al while approximately of the Ewaste generated by lowincome residents would go through landfill sites Among the young consumers this practice also prevails For example Pasiecznik et al found that of the respondents mostly young people threw their ewaste in regular household bins Cai et al identified that sell to secondhand market and sell to the qualified enterprise are the two variations of selling items to others Gok et al found the first one as the preferred method by the consumers The authors also mentioned that wait for the doortodoor recovery was widely used for ACs WMs and refrigerators and also for products that consumers perceived requiring high repair cost or cannot be repaired Ravindra and Mor specifically mentioned selling it to the secondhand dealer Selfdisassembly and secondhand use were found by Chi et al Wieser and Troger identified that tradingin or selling MPs was performed for younger aged MPs to make a new mobile phone purchase Kumar mentioned that companyowned showrooms authorized dealers and distributors as organized channels and secondhand goods shops and repair shops as unorganized channels were the two primary paths for mobile waste disposal Main disposed items the product flow Casey et al mentioned that ewaste type typically has gone through different stages including inactive EEE critical moment transition from EEE to WEEE and divestment Consumers disposal practices largely determine the final routes of ewaste Chung et al Dindarian et al postulated that the product was discarded by customers choice not for the latest technology On the other hand Wieser and Troger mentioned that the mode of disposal varies depending on the replaced device s age When consumers understand their mobile phone has some value it was preferred to reuse rather than other channels Before reaching a final disposal point products are hibernated For example Dagili utle et al found that Store and later take it to the collection points was the disposal method and MPs were disposed of the most Afroz et al identified that more than onethird of the respondents sent their unused EEE to charities and gave it to relatives when they could not repair it As there is no specific collection scheme available in the country the authors found that little fraction of ewaste went to recycling facilities Selfdisassembly and keep the useful parts were the most common disposal practice for desktop and laptop Table Top cited reasons for storing devices Blake et al Kurisu et al Bovea MD et al Ongondo and Williams Qu et al Wieser and Troger Liu et al Shaikh et al Zhang L et al Martinho et al Zhang B et al Benefits of retention For spare parts Informationdata security Difficulties backing up data Emotional attachment To give them to familyfriends Barriers to recycling Not knowing where to take devices Inconvenient or bothersome to participate in recycling or disposal High cost of recycling Low collection price MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production computers Lau et al Apart from storing WMPs at home they were donated to relatives friends and charities Tan et al For secondhand use consumers wanted to deliver used DCs WMs and laptops Chi et al Thiebaud et al identified that firsthand users disposed of CRT TVs and DVD players directly at point of disposal while FDP TVs and monitors were sent for secondhand use A higher disposal rate was found for headsets and small loudspeakers and was directly disposed of with general waste and after storage In India Singh et al found that MPs laptops cameras WMs ACs heaters geysers LED and LCD televisions were the major disposed ewaste items among the participants Huang et al mentioned that selling to waste collection centers was the main method to dispose of waste TV sets refrigerators and ACs and selling in the secondhand markets was the key method to deal with waste PCs Typically in Brazilian households MPs were kept at home and audiovideo equipment was sold mainly or passed along among rela tives friends or charity groups Echegaray Nguyen et al indicated that selling or giving the appliances to other users were pri marily adopted TVs refrigerators WMs and PCs As per a study by Bovea MD et al MPs cameras and radio alarm clocks were disposed of by the Spanish households Abbondanza and Souza found that smartphones refrigerators or freezers and WMs were the most discarded items by Brazil s households Despite being a developing country Islam et al found that MPs and PC were the dominant WEEE categories in Bangladeshi households Norms and perceived behavioral control Nduneseokwu et al identified that infrastructure moderated the relationship be tween two influencing factors attitude and subjective norm and intention Consumers who did not recycle or recycled infrequently tended to dispose of small WEEE in the general household refuse Darby and Obara Recycling behavior reflected in practice is somewhat related to the economic status of participants Those who already had a recycling habit do not have an interest in incentives Botelho et al Pandebesie et al showed that willingness to separate ewaste among consumers was relatively high and they were aware of the importance of separated waste Echegaray and Hansstein mentioned that product disposal practices remain hardly influenced by favorable views towards the environment On the other hand education had an impact on disposal behavior For example Saritha et al found in their survey that of the respondents would consider disposing of old products in an ecofriendly manner while agreed to return it to the manufacturer for free if the latter claimed to recycle products in an ecofriendly manner Technical knowledge of product use also influences an in dividual s perception regarding disposal For example Jayaraman et al showed that social consequences and the conviction of in dividuals laptop disposal practices strongly depend on knowledge of computer literacy Influencing factorsassociated with disposal decision Infrastruc ture was found as one of critical factors that determined willingness positive behavior and attitude towards ewaste recycling and selecting disposal routes Nduneseokwu et al Table shows some of the other factors affecting consumers disposal decision The reasonable distance was critical for recycling infrastructure Arain et al In developing countries the informal sector ewaste collection is generally expected Consumers preferred to deliver ewaste to the channel due to economic benefits Chung et al as ewaste is considered a valuable commodity Borthakur and Singh Central processing units CPUs of DCs computer monitors keyboards mice printers cellular phones and landline telephones were considered valuable ewaste Rodrigues et al Furthermore if ewaste is not repaired it is thrown away buying a new one is a common trend Shaikh et al On the other hand Blake et al found that design builtin obsolescence marketing and fashion trends or the speed of technology advancement were the main factors for high disposal Tan et al found that consumers expect to receive specific revenue for various disposal modes The difference between the high Fig Top disposal methods of ewaste Table Other methods of ewaste disposal among consumers Method Studies those indicated such method Throwing ewaste with household solid wastemixed waste Arain et al Araujo et al Blake et al Borthakur and Govind Bovea MD et al Chi et al Fraige et al Gok et al Martinho et al Pasiecznik et al Rodrigues et al Wieser and Troger Donate to others Abbondanza and Souza Araujo et al

Williams Wait for the doorto door recovery Cai et al Trade in OFN Cai et al Oldfor newdiscount Bovea MD et al Cao et al Colesca et al Ongondo and Williams Deliver to point purchase Martinho et al Leave it at the store during new purchase Borthakur and Govind MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production expectations of obsolete MPs and the actual collection price was also an important factor leading to a high ratio of MPs stored at home Simi larly Deng et al found that consumers kept the phones due to the low price for secondhand phones in the secondhand market Identi fying best exchange offers and price is the most critical factor for product return Chi et al Similar result was also identified by Dwivedy and Mittal In that case Kumar argued that organized channels could provide incentives to consumers under the buyback scheme In terms of the ewaste collection method Chi et al found that consumers demanded to collect other municipal wastes free doortodoor collection collect during a nonworking time easy access to collectors provide repairing and cleaning service The in fluence of online internetbased collection systems is gaining popularity however understanding consumers preferences regarding modes on line and offline of collecting ewaste mainly obsolete MPs was found paramount Liu et al Product use could also be an indicator of the ewaste disposal trend For example Li et al indicated that respondents with high in come or good education possessed most hightech household appliances advanced in technology and had the flexibility to use Impact of socioeconomic variables in disposal behavior Several studies applied statistical methods Several independent socioeconomic variables were found significant however it is often hard to generalize the predictability of behavior indicators mainly because of externalities economic growth local manufacturing public policy and others For example Abbondanza and Souza found that regional variation pace of development across a country s regions influenced disposal behavior Some common variables are mentioned in Table Botelho et al found that exchange for money mainly demanded by males was the expected incentive in Portugal followed by exchange for new EEE discount coupons on services females and consumers with a high level of education collection of EEE at home females Income and occupation mainly in the environmental sector influenced factors using ecommerce and professional recycling sites Zhang B et al Othman et al found that approximately of the ewaste generated by lowincome residents would go through four options of a waste management system ie reuse repair remanufacturing and recycling On the other hand Song et al concluded that Macau residents did not consider the small financial benefit of selling discarded electronic products which was different from mainland Chinese resi dents In terms of ewaste sorting Dagili utle et al found that females preferred to do For productfocused disposal behavior Dwiv edy and Mittal found that in India the age of waste microwave ovens was relatively shorter and consumers who were between and years old owned cars and were of middle to high income discarded most of the ovens Barriers associated to disposal Ardi et al found that consumers disposal behavior was primarily influenced by lacking wellestablished collection systems Siringo et al found that only of respondents voluntarily participated in formal ewaste recycling Disposal using municipal waste was also a popular choice due to the unavailability of appropriate options Shaikh et al High repair costcannot also be repaired found to be the critical barrier for which ewaste is stored or unrepaired Blake et al Cao et al indicated that due to OFN LE was going to formal channels however smallsized mobiles and cameras were stored at home and remained idle without incentives Collection systemonline recycling platforms For a successful e waste management system reverse logistics is a critical aspect that has been investigated in several articles On the other hand incentives are given to consumers essentially motivate them to dispose of ewaste in the system Policy associated with regulatory intervention and actors involvement in an ewaste recycling platform showed considerable impact on a collection system Appropriate disposal behavior depends on consumers awareness and knowledge regarding collection channels and online recycling platforms Articles that discussed the issues as mentioned above are analyzed in the following subsections Reverse logistics As seen earlier infrastructural factors such as availability and convenient access to recycling facilities were one of the critical components of an efficient collection system Ndu neseokwu et al and Dagili utle et al indicated that con sumer demanded more collection pointscontainers Convenience appears to matter as the number of consumers decreases with the in crease of recycling centers distance Darby and Obara Similar result was found by Saphores et al Favot and Grassetti found that population density is negatively correlated with the kg of ewaste collected The number of collection points of female of waste separately collected were positively correlated with kg of Ewaste collected Rodrigues et al identified that the number of dis carded units and the number of households were two critical parameters for RL system design Convenient transport facilities were also critical especially for SE disposal for lowincome residents Darby and Obara Darby and Obara also found that consumers needed in formation on how to dispose of WEEE and where it should be put for recycling for LE category It is not clear under what circumstances consumers disposed of their items with household refuse or in the gen eral waste at civic amenity CA sites for SE This problem is also iden tified by Botelho et al in Portugal Sorting should be considered an essential task at the initial stage of RL system development however this issue is less concerned Although Gok et al found that sorting ewaste from other types of waste was performed by of the participants mostly YUSs For young consumers multiple options should be provided Ongondo and Williams concluded that students union facilities and li braries were the preferred central locations for disposal Zhang L et al mentioned that university students intend to choose online recycling platforms to dispose of obsolete electronics Regarding online collection platforms perceived usefulness perceived ease of use atti tude subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have a positive impact while perceived risk has a negative impact on the behavioral intentions of Chinese millennials on the adoption of online ewaste collection platforms Ramzan et al Key attributes provision of incentives Cost of delivery by consumers to the collection system and receiving incentives were the two significant attributes of a successful system Blake et al found that consumers preferred to disposal cost to be collected at the product purchase point Offering discountscashback during new product purchases could be significant for greater participation Mar tinho et al Nixon et al conclude that California house holds preferred a combined service provision dropoff recycling at regional centers with curbside recycling including other options such as PayAsYouThrow PAYT depositrefund program at retail locations Park et al found that a free of charge doortodoor collection system was preferred by most of the respondents and in that case public relation activities should be increased There is a need for direct communication and booking channel with visiting engineers at the ewaste collection facility and as a free service which the consumers preferred Due to the absence of a doortodoor collection system and incentive options often there is a high chance that consumers deliver ewaste to the informal sector Lau et al Selling waste EEE items to local small scrap dealers to get economic benefits was the most preferred choice Islam et al Miner et al identified that due to the lack of a doortodoor collection program ewaste storage behavior was accelerated In this regard Pierron et al mentioned that the stockpiled small ewaste category represented a vital source of MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production revenue Cao et al mentioned that different economic and internet penetration levels were the two main factors for developing efficient collection channels within a region Thirdparty integrated network platform integrate online and offline resources were predicted to be widespread under the rapid development of IT and ecommerce On the other hand Yin et al mentioned that consumers demanded official channel incentives For WMPs doortodoor collection services were not preferred Zhang B et al indicated that peddlers onsite collection was still the dominant way of ewaste disposal and ecommerce and professional recycling site were far less competitive The authors also found that the ewaste disposal rate among low income D RMBmonth consumers were less while consumers with incomeF RMBmonth preferred ewaste collection by peddlers ecommerce Young consumers D years old preferred to use ecommerce sites for ewaste disposal while older people did not Policyoriented regulatory intervention and actors involvement Convenience and policy effectiveness influenced the youth ewaste disposal intention Shaharudin et al At the productlevel Tan et al mentioned that WEEErelated regulation is expected to affect mobile phone collection positively Chung et al found that despite the absence of a producer responsibility scheme PRS in the current EMS customers still disposed of their ewaste in the appropriate channels around Trust and quality of ewaste collection service especially who and how involved in the system were found to be significant factors among consumers Consumers trust is critical for market competitiveness for the recycling industry and involvement and endorsement of the recy cling industry and government were imperative Bai et al For example Song et al indicated that consumers demanded gov ernment departments or other organizations to be involved in the ewaste disposal mostly a welldeveloped collection system that included a component telephone reservation In China the Green Box Program and OFN activity without incentives were the two official disposal channels that consumers utilized Yin et al On the other hand Liu et al concluded that consumers preferred governmentoperated facilities or through the collection by communi cations operators and retailers Furthermore Martinho et al mentioned that producer re sponsibility organizations PROs private entities including nongovernment organizations NGOs could be potential places for sustainable disposal locations however a lack of knowledge regarding such available options was evident Kumar argued that multinational mobile manufacturing companies had collection points in India while local companies had no takeback mechanisms and more than half failed to provide information on physical collection points Araujo et al found that consumers preferred to have ewaste collection by manufacturer or seller Secondhand retail shops should also be responsible as Cao et al found that sell to secondhand stores and sell to aftersales repair stations were the two dominant choices Echegaray and Hansstein mentioned that the government should take advantage of municipal garbage collection systems that may include a segregated solid waste collection and manufacturers or retailers point of disposal of ewaste to enforce current regulations Awasthi and Li argued that nongovernment organizations NGOs could play a vital role in mediating consumers improper disposal behavior where sociocultural circumstances lack of advanced technology and infrastructure and environmental considerations are limited Besides manufacturers and municipalities should be more active and involved in collection activities Deniz et al It is necessary to promote legal ways of disposal or prepare scrapyards for large ewaste equipment Nowakowski Impact of awareness and perception on disposal decision Environmental awareness was cited in the literature as a key factor influencing disposal behavior Ardi et al Jayaraman et al mentioned that individual awareness had a positive impact on laptop disposal behavior Giving information about ewaste and its environmental risks would significantly increase proper disposal behavior Gok et al as a significant number of consumers did not have information about where to dispose of the ewaste Dindarian et al Gilal et al mentioned that WOM significantly impacted consumers ewaste disposal behavior which also motivated acting to recycle appropriately Furthermore welldesigned and doorstepping delivery of the campaigns could potentially shape con sumers disposal behavior for the items Botelho et al found that lack of awareness of consumers delivery of ewasterelated information and the consumers sociodemographic factors significantly affected consumers motivation to return ewaste Analyzing consumers RR behavior In the light of the CE principle RR is the first step of the entire closedloop chain that extends the product lifespan and reclaim the value of used EEE However the researchers have not investigated this issue extensively only of the articles mostly from developed countries discussed this specific consumer behavior Product design perspectives Chuang and Liao examined consumerdriven innovation in green product designing considering Taiwanese residents focusing on the digital camera Using conjoint analysis the authors found that consumers innovative design ideas could significantly improve product design and this issue should be considered in designing energyrelated products PerezBelis et al showed that of the consumers had never repaired any products that fall under the small ewaste category while of the Table Factors affecting consumers ewaste disposal decision Factor Reference

al Types of residence Dagili utle et al Nowakowski MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production participants bought secondhand small EEE The study results also revealed that consumers demanded product information in terms of design and labeling and the products durability On the other hand of the respondents of Dagili utle et al s survey repaired MPs when it was malfunctioning Central problems of MPs were with the battery software buttonbuttons stop functioning malfunctioning during power onoff Borthakur and Singh However Wieser and Troger stated that MPs perceived speed of obsolescence was vital for repair and reuse Chi et al mentioned that cell phones TVs laptops and refrigerators are the major products which have sig nificant room for recirculation by repairing Othman et al mentioned that manufacturers should design products that are easily repairable and incorporate recycled content and remanufactured components Barriers to repair and reuse Bhatt et al found that re spondents preferred to buy new MPs instead of repairing and reusing them due to the higher repair cost It was also found valid for other types of electronic products Pandebesie et al The same reason identified by Echegaray and the author mentioned that the productrepair market remains underdeveloped due to manufacturers intention for higher returns selling new products This reason is not only prevalent in a developing country but also in developed countries Consumers from the developed country can buy a new EEE product instead of repairing as there is hardly any cost difference This con tributes to increased EG with Blake et al finding that lack of ability to repairthe cost to repair was one of the significant drivers for EG Sabbaghi and Behdad found that consumers have robust repair behavior for products but that the cost of manufacturers repair service can be a significant inhibitor resulting in losses for both con sumers and manufacturers The authors also estimated that WTP for repairing decreased at an annual rate of YlaMella et al found that reliability perceived shorter product lifespan due to fast technical progress and the existence of new budget models were the main reasons not to purchase used phones Another perspective of RR is the secondhand market of the reus able product Dindarian et al found that current product design and the lack of market for secondhand items are significant barriers to product reuse Bovea et al showed that except for minor repairs of heaters toasters and vacuum cleaners most SE category products were not repaired Availability of cheap spare parts and difficulties during the disassembly process were the main constraints for repairing The study also found that only of respondents repaired their smallEEE while less than bought secondhand products from the repair shop The reasons are also found valid for components eg battery of MPs and computers and accessories Saritha et al Lack of knowledge about repair and waiting periods were also critical for repair activities PerezBelis et al Environmentally sustainable products Bovea M et al inspected consumers preferences in product design and labeling that can contribute to the CE considering durability repairability recycled material content low environmental impact fair working conditions and origin They found that Spanish consumers were concerned about fair working conditions and durability of products Kumar mentioned that the repairrelated secondary market is mostly dominated by the informal sector which has a relatively lowperformance recir culating product in an environmentally friendly manner The authors mentioned that extending lifespan is also an indicator of environmental products PerezBelis et al found that respondents who repaired appliances eg vacuum cleaners juicers and toasters were using the products for more than four years On the other hand for cheaper electronics the cost of repair is generally found high Thiebaud et al mentioned that after repair products average service life is extended by at least Secondhand product purchase Secondhand product purchase is a relatively common practice in developing countries for example Abbondanza and Souza mentioned secondhand product acqui sition from donations and directly from past users Bovea MD et al found that more than half of the partici pants never repaired broken ewaste items while of the respondents never bought secondhand EEE items Similar results were found by PerezBelis V et al for electronic toys in Spain Chung et al found that consumers would buy secondhand products if the reconditioned product s price were substantially lower than new products durability and performance of the reconditioned product is guaranteed and finally the warranty level is similar to that of new products The authors also mentioned that there should be an authori tative quality assurance scheme that might take responsibility for reconditioned products Lacking the factors mentioned above in repaired products of the respondents of Fraige et al s study were not interested in purchasing secondhand products Even though people bought the products that was mainly due to economic reasons and for temporary use These factors were also mentioned by YlaMella et al and Rodrigues et al in their research Environmental education largely influences environmental behavior specifically on secondhand product purchases PerezBelis V et al a A higher percentage of households reused their old cell phones than TV sets Milovantseva and Saphores a Borthakur and Govind found that instead of repairing consumers tended to purchase a new phone due to repair cost which was the primary reason for new product purchase followed by new product features status symbol and the ripple effect of other people purchasing new products Borthakur and Singh found that unrepairability was the main reason for purchasing a new phone while repairing was an alternative reason The authors also mentioned that repair shop owners also discourage consumers from repairing as there are insignificant differ ences between repair costs and new product purchases The repair shops are also acting as a selling point for secondhand items As consumers have less intention to buy secondhand products the shops might hold their repaired items for longer an indirect economic loss involved in the process Echegaray mentioned that consumers believed that their ewaste was beyond repair in most cases although deliberate lifespan curtailment by producers or consumers directly influenced this perspective In that case symbolic and planned obsolescence was both critical and existed Consumers experience a technologydriven push purchase new EEE and barriers in extending product lifespan which was often a difficult choice assessing cost and benefits of product repairing Rodrigues et al identified those vacuum cleaners radio re ceivers CRT displays and freezers were some of the devices that had the opportunity for reuse Secondhand items as gifts from others were not expected for printers sandwich toasters grills and electric toasters Notebooks CRT displays radio receivers and computers could be considered during secondhand purchases The authors also found that the main reasons for not buying secondhand items were new EEE is better cheaper and guaranteed and mistrust of the durability of used EEE which is evident in most developed countries Smartphones and tablets have reuse potential Martinho et al Analyzing consumers recycling behavior Recycling behavior often overlaps with disposal behavior Around of the articles explored the behavior investigating either con sumers recycle their product or not disposed of in a formal collection facility any monetary incentives demanded by the consumers or not or in some cases consumers preferences in selecting recycling facilities among various available options WTP was another aspect investigated MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production by the articles to identify how much of the recycling fees consumers were willing to pay if any system requires it This issue was mainly discussed from the developing countries context because no specific collection and recycling options are available to the customer Willingness to participate in a recycling system Besides WTP consumers motivationwillingness towards participating in the formal ewaste recycling system was one of the discussed issues in the investi gated articles In the section recyclingrelated determining factors from the consumers end were analyzed On the other hand socioeconomic factors such as age income education and others impacted recy cling behavior Specific characteristics of the formal recycling systems were analyzed as well which were found to influence consumers participation in a recycling system Determining factors According to Zhang Y et al compensation mode collection price and convenience degree were the three determining factors that enhanced participation of customers in a MP recycling system Thi Thu Nguyen et al found social pres sure while Li et al found inconvenience of recycling as the factor Martinho et al found awareness of the recycling program and better communication strategies regarding recycling services were the two critical factor that could enhance consumers participation Such factors were also identified by Milovantseva and Saphores a in addition to cost of recycling and laws and regulations On the other hand Otto et al mentioned that environmental motivation and behavioral costs were the main factors where the latter could be manipulated within the short term In addition to that envi ronmental awareness and recycling prices were also critical Cai et al Siringo et al mentioned the importance of recycling intention information and recycling convenience for participation From the RL perspective Blake et al found that the structure of the services available including provision and cost was significant Siringo et al found similar findings Socio economic factors and influencing components of TPB Jafari et al found that household income household size edu cation ewaste awareness and marital status were the main factors for consumers incentive dependency Kumar found that for young consumers attitude perceived control subjective norm and individual responsibility were the main influencing factors while con venience and awareness did not have any influence on the behavior Saphores et al found that moral norms toxicity knowledge about the toxic content in ewaste and recycling at workschool posi tively influence recycling behavior Colesca et al indicated that recycling knowledge proenvironmental norms and institutional sup port had a moderate effect on recycling behavior Saphores et al found that gender education convenience and environmental beliefs had a strong relationship with the willingness to recycle while income or political affiliation were found insignificant Table shows the significant and not significant socioeconomic and demographic vari ables responsible for ewaste recycling behavior Recycling behavior is strongly influenced by a sense of duty and perceived control rather than subjective norms and benefits Kumar Nduneseokwu et al and Wang et al both mentioned that attitude subjective norm and environmental knowl edge significantly influenced consumers intentions to recycle The mediating factor such as infrastructure influenced attitude and sub jective norm and intention On the other hand proenvironmental ac tivities and attitudes toward recycling small household electronics were essential in recycling the specific category of ewaste Moral norms and environmental beliefs to recycle ewaste and to engage in proenvironmental behaviors were found critical In ewaste recycling subjective norms played a more significant role than the other constructs of TPB Milovantseva and Saphores a Similar trend was observed by Wang et al Papaoikonomou et al found that total attitude main significant predictor WTP information status and subjective norm were other significant factors of WEEE recycling Characteristics of formal recycling system YlaMella et al found that convenience and proximity of recycling facilities and service should be considered as the main characteristics of a successful recycling system Nixon et al showed the importance of the factor as well coupled with the factor cost On the other hand in addition to these factors Wang et al mentioned about economic benefits Need for more collection points same as convenience and refund system economic benefits were identified as the success fac tors of a recycling system by Dagili utle et al A centralized collection facility Onestop dropoff points for all types of ewaste could be an additional factor Islam et al a Of course residential conditions and recycling habits were significant is sues in such aspects Wang et al However Lakhan identified that perceived environmental harm and visible fees as a sticker on to a product are strongly associated which should be considered as counterproductive factors for WTP Providing the solu tion to this problem Dwivedy and Mittal proposed that visible and transparent fees and exchangeable sponsorship where the ARF collected for one category of products is used to sponsor recycling of another category of products in terms of fees should be implemented Servicelevel integration could be built by Ewaste recycling coupons given to householders via rates payment receipts of local councils rates for general waste collection services Blake et al The monetary influence was positively and significantly associated with the product takeback efforts especially for young consumers Ongondo and Wil liams Song et al mentioned that increasing the pop ulation s education level and propagandizing ewaste knowledge to promote residents understanding should be considered a longterm and shortterm approach respectively Formal ewaste collection channel and EPR Ramzan et al mentioned that voluntarybased formal programs have fewer chances to ensure consumers participation Blake et al identi fied that cost to recycle and lack of knowledge are the two barriers to success for the voluntary program Qu et al mentioned that collection price and collector s quality certification were the two critical attributes selecting collection services among the consumers In terms of service preference compensation mode collection price and conve nience degree were the most significant factors for a formal collection channel Zhang Y et al Tan et al found that convenience of collection facilities at various locations and a guarantee of information security was the leading product return performance indicators Arain et al found incentives and broader product coverage especially smallsized ewaste as the indicators When delivering products make appoint ment online or by phone first then have it picked up by the recycler was the preferred method of collection among consumers Bai et al Arain et al identified that factors for accessibility to recycling centers were pickup services ewaste drives or providing a recycling dropoff center near campus Bouvier and Wagner identified that recycling fees and frequency of the recycling facilities opening were negatively and positively correlated respectively with the number of waste TV sets and monitors collected eg collection rate in the recy cling facilities Otto et al identified collection cost reduction techniques as curbside collection and deposit containers as a direct approach and the material and social enticements as an indirect approach WTP for formal EMS Li et al found that young con sumers were more in favor of charging for discarding the product for a formal EMS and it varied from to of the recycling fees for the products Similar result was found by Ramzan et al On the other hand Liu et al found that consumers WTP for ewaste has not increased for WMPs Chung et al identified some preconditions MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production of the WTP They found that collecting recycling fees involves some critical issues such as a high degree of transparency using recycling funds levied recycling fee visibility of the fees fees paid directly to manufacturers cost that covers proper recycling and finally fees paid at the point of purchase In terms of method of payment Dwivedy and Mittal mentioned that a scheme charging after product takeback occurred is more preferred than advanced recycling fees ARFs Lakhan proposed that fees could be collected as environmental handling fees are a form of tax Even though manufacturers should be responsible solely for the environment consumers were willing to pay voluntarily to improve the environment showing proenvironmental behavior For example Afroz et al found that of the residents showed a positive attitude towards WTP for recycling system development On the other hand Huang et al s study showed that of the respondents were willing to pay for environmental improvement in China while purchasing environment friendly products The amount of recycling cost that was agreed by the consumers indicated as the highest percentage was of recycling cost for households Yin et al of the product cost Saritha et al of the product price Shaikh et al of the product market price Dwivedy and Mittal The quantitative assessment showed that the mean monthly fee of WTP agreed among residents in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia was US per household Afroz et al while Song et al found that in China the mean WTP lower and upper values were US and US US dollar respectively Cai et al found the amount as US per month For productspecific WTP Arain et al identified that US to recycle a television and US to recycle a battery US for a laptop US for a cell phone Arain et al also found that batteries cell phones and tele visions laptops were among the top products for which consumers were willing to pay a recycling fee Liu et al found that some partic ipants thought that paying for ewaste recycling is unrealistic Same issue was previously identified by Afroz et al Song et al found that the reasons behind not willing to pay for recycling vary substantially depending on the participants socioeconomic condition For example some consumers believed that it is the government s re sponsibility services should be free of charge Song et al As the informal sector pays consumers economic benefits for this reason most consumers felt reluctant to pay fees Dwivedy and Mittal Low household income and satisfaction with the current situation were also found to be the reasons for such a negative attitude Islam et al In addition to that Dwivedy and Mittal also found that higher cost of living lack of time and nonmandated regulations were some of the other causes of the attitude According to Afroz et al education level age and household income significantly impacted households WTP for improving the WEEE management system Similar results were found by Song et al Li et al mentioned that educational level and awareness of recycling WEEE positively influenced WTP while income level did not Reverse logistics According to Chung et al existing RL system should be more convenient reliable and accessible to con sumers Similar results were found from YlaMella et al s study Favot and Grassetti found that additional collection points would enhance ewaste collection rate Regarding the collection channels more specifically for MPs dropoff bins at retail stores and wireless service provider stores would be potential locations Milovantseva and Saphores a Milovantseva and Saphores a mentioned of mailback services with incentives as the potential method Ongondo and Williams mentioned about library Otto et al mentioned about central locations for arranging ewaste collection event For recycling service selection Bai et al proposed that recycling services would positively impact new MPs sales Consumers would choose a seller with the recycling service over other conven tional sellers and the price was given importance over convenience Deng et al found that price the most critical factors ease of execution ease of contact ease of finding the location appropriate method of treatmentmobile phone recycling and service time were the key variables in consumers recycling experience For highlypriced MPs rewards are expected and for cheaper models convenience Bai et al However two main barriers act in the process specifically for convenience degree of collection mode excessive time and money Zhang Y et al To minimize the RL process complexity and cost Bai et al proposed that thirdparty recycling campaigns convenient online secondhand transaction platforms would be benefi cial Jafari et al mentioned that government support and private sector investment awarenessbuilding efforts should be the focus on areas of RL process optimization Informal sector The informal sector is one of the key actors in the recycling chain and contributes to the circulation of materials and products In other words the informal sector influenced recycling behavior Wang et al Lau et al found that selling ewaste to private informal ewaste collectors was the most preferred way among consumers due to perceived convenience Environmental awareness attitude perceptions regarding informal recycling and in come were the direct determinants whereas costs of recycling social norms and publicity were indirect factors selecting informal sector ewaste collectors Wang et al Cao et al identified that leading collectors channels for ewaste were street peddlers appliance repairing stores waste collection stations and dismantling workshops On the other hand Zhang B et al found street peddlers ecommerce sites and professional collection sites were the main chan nels The informal sector s main characteristics providing collection services were convenient flexible accessible acceptability of a wide range of ewaste categories Chi et al Onlinerecycling platform With the digital datadriven society consumers are more willing to use onlinebased services for product purchase and product disposal Zhang L et al found that young students as a growing consumer segment are preferred to use online recycling platforms Incentives are found interrelated with the willing ness to participate in an online recycling platform For example Wang Table Factors affecting ewaste

positively influenced by perceived behavioral control sub jective norms attitudes and economic motivation Wang et al also found that due to more significant economic benefits willingness to participate in the platforms is higher than traditional informal section collection and recycling Critical barriers to recycling Some of the critical barriers need to be focused on an efficient recycling system For example Liu et al and Bai et al found that information leakage incentive and convenience must be considered for any recycling system while Thi Thu Nguyen et al found that the inconvenience of recycling was negatively correlated to residents recycling behavioral intention For waste MPs Saritha et al identified the main reasons for not recycling were lack of formal collection channels and price of returned product On the other hand Tan et al found low public awareness of collection responsibility and insufficient promotion of formal collection were the reasons associated to that According to Fraige et al cost of recycling the most critical reason lack of recycling plants lack of legislation and management systems lack of awareness lack of public trust regarding recycled equipment and the unstable generation of WEEE that needs recycling were the main bar riers Gu et al mentioned that consumers lack of awareness regarding the appropriate destination of ewaste do not know where to send waste unexpected privacy disclosure troublesome procedure and lack of public awareness were the critical barriers to the recycling system Results and discussion To enable a smooth transition towards CE a multifaceted approach involved integrated measures is critical This section discusses possible policy initiatives towards sustainable EM and business model innovation from the CE viewpoint based on the indepth literature review pre sented in section Table A in the appendix provides a consumer centric CE framework that connects the critical elements of CE build ing blocks actors involved sectoral perspective and associated path ways of CE combing elements of Figs and This addresses a key gap in academic research to date by integrating all of these aspects in a single framework that focuses on consumer behavior and ewaste This is potentially advantageous for developing nationallevel strategies and policies with Table A also enabling the identification of future research opportunities Section and Section discuss policy implications and business model development respectively in order to answer RQ in relation to the need for an operational framework to achieve CE around ewaste Specifically Section addresses the major research gaps and potential future research opportunities in the research field Policy implications towards CE This section discusses policyrelated issues such as consumers awareness improvement measures economic incentives to consumers infrastructure development and regulatory interventions Such discus sion would enable governments effort towards developing sustainable ewaste management systems and achieving a circular economy Consumer awareness campaigns and pathways for information dissemination A diverse range of consumers households individuals university students was analyzed in the reviewed articles There is a clear need for increased effort to organize awarenessraising programs and publicize e waste collection and disposalrelated information Sectorspecific pro grams to raise public awareness should be planned and delivered tar geting households schools universities and the private sector Islam et al Specific education and course materials in early childhood or elementary education resulted in the successful collection of small WEEE in Spain Sole et al This approach can lead to the creation of an entirely new consumer base across diverse countries who are environmentally cautious and understand their roles and responsibilities in a sustainable EMS Awarenessraising campaigns should include ewaste sorting associated service providers available disposal methods material content recycling campaigns environmental pro tection internetbased online collection system and product labeling ewaste logo at the back of an EEE Additionally if ewaste is recycled resource conservation then information on the amount of material and energy saved should also be the campaigns components The government more specifically local government plays a crucial role in disseminating knowledge and information on ewaste to the public to improve their ewaste management and recycling habits Davis and Herat The media used for information dissemination could be via newspaper audiovisual personal communication television and radio websites or mobile apps posters information leaflets social media word of mouth WOM pilot projects workshops and seminars Among these media social networking sites are considered to be a costeffective path for delivering this information Ramzan et al To reinforce moral and social norms church groups might play a critical role Saphores et al Physical locations for disseminating infor mation could be residential building entrances shopping centers and transport during morning and evening consumers travel time The workplace could also be an essential place to raise awareness as working people spend much of their time in these areas The contents of awarenessraising material and frequency of circu lating the information were found to be crucial in the reviewed studies For information materials attractive design and colors could be used and feedback sheets on current service satisfaction could be added Product labeling with easily visible ewaste signs should be designed Household waste collection bins should have stickers that inform con sumers not to dispose of their ewaste items into the bin should be prepared Lakhan Source separation at the generation point e g households should be encouraged for adequate recovery Publicizing information on the CE should also be promoted in a broader context Consumerfocused economic incentives Economic incentives aimed at consumers are crucial to ensuring that disposed ewaste reaches formal collection and recycling facilities Economic incentives can eliminate unused EEE items storage behavior and improper disposal of ewaste Nowakowski Liu et al concluded that for valueadded products such as smartphones in centives are critical Similar comment was made by Tan et al MPs penetration rate should be considered as a regional development indicator MPs often become obsolete due to service contract ending such as the case found by Martinho et al in Portugal Ongondo and Williams found the same reason existed in UK As MP service operators are playing a critical role in EoL product management one strategy could be proving additional internet data packages to con sumers as incentives to collect old unwanted phones Direct incentives such as tradein for cash Tan et al old for new Chi et al or discountcashback offers Martinho et al have been found to be practical ways of providing financial incentives to encourage a CE for ewaste In determining the optimal level of incentives the discarded or reusable items local market price needs to be estimated with Kumar highlighting the importance of understanding consumer selling behavior in order to determine an appropriate incentive to return products such as MPs This is particularly important in developing countries with intensive competition between the informal sector and formal ewaste collectors However according to Benabou and Tirole incentives are weak behavior reinforcers over the short term and negatively impact long term behavior In centives are also dependent on sociodemographic variables Botelho et al Jafari et al stated that household size income level education and marital status were some of the variables Students could MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production be given monetary rewards approximately USD per student for small household appliances considering value retrieved from secondary ma terials Pierron et al Depositreturn schemes should be given special attention as an essential economic instrument Saphores et al These could be applied to both developed nations and developing countries Despite being a developing country the scheme was preferred by of the Vietnamese respondents the mostpreferred scheme in a Vietnamese study Nguyen et al The flow of ewaste can be streamlined under this system by establishing testing facilities and maintenance centers for RR by which reclaimed products can be transferred to a social organization for further use Currently a lack of legal incentives promoting repairs and secondhand sales is considered a barrier to reuse practice Bovea et al Kahhat et al proposed a depositrefund system based on radiofrequency identification device RFID Infrastructure development Wang et al found that the availability of collection and recycling services to consumers significantly affect their awareness levels Without proper collection and recycling facilities it is hard to implement a formalized EMS Liu et al Construction and improvement of ewaste recycling infrastructure are the first steps that governments should take to foster increased collection and recycling rates Regional infrastructure development with the help of public support has been found to be particularly vital Nowakowski with a need for governments to subsidize investments in necessary fa cilities Special collection events for small and IT equipment could be arranged Permanent collection points and event collection in highly populated areas could be established Fraige et al An active monitoring system identifying ewaste flows in various final disposal points needs to be investigated by the waste management authorities and other stakeholders through collaboration and coordination mecha nisms Overall there is a clear need to bridge the information supplied to consumers regarding formal collection and recycling facilities and local recycling infrastructure development for enhancing consumers level of awareness Legislation and regulatory interventions Policy formulation should be focused more on consumers attitudes towards ewaste with the behavioral insights provided by the reviewed studies used to inform government regulations and programs To in crease awareness around national ewaste recovery programs it is important to consider age household size income gender and educa tion level EPR implementation with government and nongovernment organizations NGOs should be given more attention In most in stances existing ewasterelated regulation was found to be weak and did not reflect consumers economic perspectives The imposition of penalties for improper disposal were also suggested by study authors and making consumers responsible at the collection stage was found crucial In most of the cases consumers from developing countries demanded price incentives at the time of disposal due to the presence of informal collectors and subsidy amounts that can motivate consumers to choose formal collection facilities need careful attention In connec tion to this regulatory reform and legallybinding provisions that make consumers more responsible for overall EM should be considered In centives to informal sector ewaste collectors also need to be provided for efficient and environmentally responsible recycling Lau et al Advanced recycling fees ARFs mandated in ewastespecific regu lations are an option for mediating consumers disposal habits Although ARFs were identified by a majority of articles as a burden for consumers if legal obligations bound consumers to pay the fee in the form of ARF or recycling fees at the time of disposal Implementing ARFs through product pricing was also found to eliminate economic bottlenecks in an EMS in Switzerland Islam et al Extended producer responsibility EPR implementation in devel oping nations is particularly challenging as it imposes a cost on con sumers Dwivedy and Mittal The prospect of EPR as a mandatory program needs further attention from policymakers which will even tually restrict illegal imports and informal sector downstream recycling process As EPR holds manufacturers and producers accountable for sustainable product lifecycle management two of the indicators of product design product durability quality and product lifespanshould be directly interlinked with the EPR policy agenda Official takeback schemes through a compulsory retailerbased collec tion system should be considered further as voluntary schemes often fail to ensure widespread public participation Blake et al Increasing awareness among consumers is one of the fundamental tasks of any CRS A lack of information regarding collection centers existence and locations was found to be a barrier to a CE for ewaste highlighting the need for a greater focus on increasing consumer awareness in national policy planning Milovantseva argues that public support for green product design regulations can increase their likelihood of adoption by governments Emphasis should also be placed on providing small and medium enterprises SMEs with incentives and subsidies that encourage green entrepreneurship for product design and development of local recycling facilities Technology transfer for implementing EPRrelated initiatives should be included in regional development planning Training and capacity building of formal recycling sector stakeholders need to improve Dwivedy and Mittal mention that market mechanisms fail within current EMSs due to externalities informal sector in developing coun tries Innovative financing mechanisms need to be established for setting up infrastructure in developing countries and internationaliza tion of recycling law is needed in the light of EU WEEE Directive and EPR The CE package initiated by the EU could be an example for pol icymakers in developing countries Business model innovation Business model innovation is a critical aspect of a circular economy Pieroni et al In this subsection based on the indepth literature analysis presented in Section product design secondhand product and supply chain reverse logistics service provider online markets and data management for ewaste generation mobile applications and social media and finally charity organizations and retailer coordinationrelated issues were discussed Product design According to Chuang and Liao there is a pressing need to understand cultural differences in behaviors particularly in the context of designing less resourceintensive products and services Under standing consumers engagement with EEE is vital to product design especially as the reviewed studies show that psychological undesirabil ity has far more effect than technological obsolescence on consumer behavior Furthermore it is seen that most of the consumers regardless of the country tended to save old EEE for spare parts creating oppor tunities for modular product design and simple repairability using a userfriendly instruction eg diagramsprocess figures In most cases product user manuals provide information on product use with limited troubleshooting information or repair instructions Supply of spare parts and repair service availability are interrelated and products and parts manufacturers should focus on this issue during product design Aspects such as material use recycled or virgin materials product lifespan related data date of manufacturing expected expiry date years of service guarantee visible ewaste logo and RFID based product tracking system to include recycling fees monitor at the recycling centersimproper disposal should be integrated with product design for sustainable EM planning According to Dindarian et al there are hardly any incentive available for designing products that facilitate reuse MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production Secondhand product and supply chain The growing secondhand product market is evident worldwide primarily involving online product selling platforms such as eBay and Gumtree in Australia Oversight of this market by central authorities is needed to support local business and achieve consumers trust in used products Service guarantee and quality assurance could be the key to a thriving used product market that integrate ewaste recycling services The benefits of secondhand product purchase and use and secondhand product stores and outlets should be considered by service providers Incentivesupported modular repair service for WMPs could vastly reduce rapid product replacement Reverse logistics service provider Economic incentives given to consumers in the form of collection price could form an integral part of the reverse logistic RL service model The responsibilities of service providers are multifaced including determining the appropriate mode of compensation and ensuring that services are convenient to users The cost of recycling is an important aspect that should be visible collected at the product pur chase point RL service providers must ensure the transparency of the process and necessary policy and regulation should be formulated to support regular operation and maintain continuous consumer satisfac tion Telephone reservation and direct communication with the RL service provider would further enhance the product return process with consumers preferring governmentsupported RL service providers for reasons of accountability Park et al RL service providers may use the existing network of waste collection authorities municipal council collection and in this process they can educate consumers and increase awareness In this way consumers pro environmental behavior could be further enhanced Local government can play a critical role in enhancing public relations activities around e waste collection Islam and Huda a especially for WMPs Infor mation dissemination should be considered an essential operational activity for both local government and service provider Campaigns focused on product lifespan with incentives could be organized to cap ture highvalue materials from stored or unused items eg MPs In collecting SE ewaste opportunities exist for new small businesses to be developed around modular ewaste collection that integrate OFN exchange offers and cashcoupon arrangements in the case of revers ible items Subjective norms have been found to be critical to ewaste recycling and RL service providers both governmentoperated and privatelyowned under government regulation could significantly mediate behavioral intentions This has the potential to reduce mobile phone storage which has become a social norm RL service providers could be standardized through certification by government de partments to maintain the quality of ewaste collectors including ca pacity to deliver repair services specific products Reliability and accessibility of service eg number of collection points was found to be critical in the articles reviewed Generally population centers should be targeted Qu et al potentially including retail stores in the form of a dropoff bins mobile network service providers outlets for WMP collection libraries supermarkets dedicated areas for electronics stores The service provision of reverse logistics arrangements should assess reasonable distance ensuring collection points at the centers Free mailback service with incentives could also help to collect ewaste especially for small ewaste items as consumers are more concerned about service time and rewards from the collection channel A flexible doortodoor collection could be estab lished based on mobile apps and telephone reservations Young con sumers should be particularly encouraged to use online platforms for ewaste recycling Partnering with informal sector collectors could help expand the collection network Government support and policy initia tives are mainly required for this instance especially providing in centives Dwivedy and Mittal On the other hand establishing relationship with charity and secondhand product stores and businesses would bypass product flows that are generally destined for recycling only In this aspect consumers perceived behavioral controlrelated issues should be closely observed particularly any changes in recy cling behavior in the presence of a governmentsupported RL service provider Online markets and data management for EG More products are now being sold online than ever before and in the recent COVID pandemic sales of electronic products have been skyrocketing World Economic Forum Simultaneously the on line market both new product sales and secondhand market should be considered an essential element of product life management For this case the use of internetofthings IoT big data analytics for combining socioeconomic data with the distribution of waste across a geographical location and blockchain technology could provide new insights on consumption habits Zhang B et al previously mentioned the impact on big data in ecommerce sites associated with consumption modes and ewaste recycling services Cao et al urged to examine effect of blockchain technology on transportation material flow and payment for WEEE collection modes Improved data quality on EoL product specially ewaste traceability is critical for a formal ewaste collection system Qu et al The importance of dataoriented product labeling was found by several researchers for example research by Bovea MD et al and Huang et al Major indicators of ewaste generation levels include device replace ment rates poor repairability growing segment of consumer for elec tronic products and rapid development of electronic product Arain et al At household level Fraige et al mentioned about two indicators household device penetration rates and products ser vice life Data can be collected on product lifespan by identifying the date of manufacturing and when consumers posted an advertisement for a product This way firsthand product use characteristics life spanrelated data could be gathered and utilized by applying various statistical models such as the Weibulldistributionbased sales stocklifespan model Mobile applications and social media The use of technology especially mobile apps to support behavioral change is increasingly considered a useful tool to reduce ewaste Kang et al Although platforms such as Love Recycling Taolv Haoshou and Baidu have already become popular platforms Wang et al broader service coverage is required for this effort Further attention is also required around standardized pricesetting and service innovation for persons over years of age Government intervention is required for onlineinternetbased collection platforms for ewaste collection and recycling as concerns over privacy are critical These services should be expanded not only for waste MP but also for other ewaste items Promoting the platform to rural and remote areas is another key task which could be developed using optimized artificial intelligence AI algorithms Using AI algorithms such as simulated annealing tabu search greedy bee colony optimization Nowakowski et al simulated ewaste collection requests Jiang et al integrated IoT and subscription accounts on social media platforms for household waste management Providing substantial incentives and training to local formal collectors should be considered in a smart EMS Charity organization and retailer coordination Many used products flow to charity organizations after initial prod uct use The most viable donation organizations are a charity and local schools Gupta and Kumar where product reuse is often signif icantly higher than for other niche consumer segments For example Kahhat and Williams found that of computers donated to charitable organizations were reused This shows that there is a sec ondary product market other than the conventional online EEE sellingbuying platforms which requires specific attention There is an opportunity for charity organizations to provide repair services at a larger scale creating jobs in local communities Islam and Huda MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production c Technical financial and physical support from government business and philanthropic organizations is needed to support the op erations of charitable organizations Donation sites and information campaigns on product reuse could be organized at schools and offices of social service providers An integrated approach could be adopted that incorporates EEE re tailers whereby consumer might buy secondhand refurbished products from retailers repaired by charity organizations alongside new equipment Islam and Huda b In that case certification and quality assurance would be required to achieve consumer trust and acceptability Retailers should be provided the necessary infrastructure support to collect disposed items by consumers and retailers might provide cashincentives to consumers Establishing optimized collection points for repair services and setting standardized repair price also require further attention Secondhand product circulation will be suc cessful if retailers manufacturers service providers governments and charity organizations work together Analysis of research gap and future research directions After reviewing articles in this work several research gaps were identified and analyzed in detail These are discussed below to address the requirement of RQ around the potential for further research studies Apart from China and India the number of studies that have been performed on consumer beahvior around ewaste in developing countries is limited and requires further attention as per Fig Germany is also a gap with only one paper identified despite it being one of the largest ewaste generating nations globally Islam et al b It is understood that German EM is well developed however investigation on consumers repair and reuse and storage behavior would substantially provide insight for other developed nations which is currently missing in the academic research Through the policy and business model innovation discussed in section and in section respectively there is an opportunity to study changes in consumers behavior over time before and after interventions are implemented Consumers from socalled innovative sities highly IT enabled cities or cities with high tech companies present should be investigated further This was revealed as a key research opportunity in this re view with a potential list of cities prvided by Leskin This also supports the call from Borthakur and Govind for more localespecific studies to understand the dynamic behavior of ewaste disposal and awareness across nations Consumer behavior across product categories needs further atten tion For example disposal behavior for SE and LE category is entirely different As such how consumers act for spercific products eg DVD player vs refrigerator or for specific groups of products eg SE vs LE require investigation Through this potential improvement opportunities could be identified for specific types of products There is a clear opportunity for researchers to further investigate consumer consensus around ARF systems In some studies the WTP amount was investigated but the desired amount of incentives cash or any other method that consumers required was not investigated Furthermore WTPrelated studies should focus more on imple menting analytical methodologies such as analytical hierarchy pro cess AHP analytical network process ANP and conjoint analysis In responding to WTPrelated questions in a survey pictoral repre sentations of ewaste collection and recycling services could be provided to deliver information to consumers about their roles and responsibilities financial and physical The economic benefits of internet or onlinebased system from con sumers perspective require future research In this regard identi fying flows of ewaste would be a key first step and implementing material flow analysis MFA models would be beneficial MFA is capable of quantifying which platforms are profitable traditional vs online collection considering all the actors eg government con sumers network platforms processing facilities in the RL supply chain Islam and Huda a Most of the studies reviewed were focused on the individual and householdlevel Specific attention should be given to other con sumers such as government offices higher education institutions and large multinational companies Technological companies should be future study areas as mentioned by Fraige et al This study identified that a smaller number of studies were con ducted considering the young population more specifically students studying at the universities Future studies should focus on this group of people as it is also found from the articles that this group s possession rate in some of the EEE is higher than the general popu lation indicating that different social norms may apply to this group Close attention is required around product return management through followup research into for example the funding mecha nisms needed for informal collectors price setting for various types of ewaste dedicated to consumers and the role of various stake holders in the development of facilities Wang et al found that substantial differences exist in term of ewaste storage behavior among homeowners and renters in China Future research should target these two groups of residents and investigate their ewaste disposal and recycling behavior including in other countries Furthermore the authors found that income and level of education were not significant predictors for the group so better statistical aspects considering other socioeconomic variables such as the number of families in the households the number of children need to be considered Echegaray and Hansstein mentioned that highincome group adequately dispose of ewaste in appropriate channels in Brazil However it is necessary to under stand why lowincome residents are not involved in recycling and their potential demand for such services including in other devel oping countries As cheaper products tend to have shorter lifespans product design characteristics need to be investigated further By analyzing samples across a range of products a bill of materials BoM could be developed and essential design modifications cost and quality efficient products could be identified by engaging YUSs Babbitt et al recently applied BoM for collecting disassembly prop erties of EEE Consumers ecofriendly behavior remains until the product pur chase but is diminished in the usephase and at the EoL phase Future research should identify the reasons for such practices focusing on product design environmental labeling and other fac tors Echegaray and Hansstein mentioned that ewaste is not seen as a recyclable item as compared to other recyclable items such as paper plastics and others Why consumers do not consider ewaste as recyclable items is an open research question According to Borthakur and Govind ewasterelated studies are now being conducted mostly from naturalapplied science dis ciplines An interdisciplinary approach is required in understanding consumers behavior towards ewaste from social science and policy research areas A holistic technoeconomic perspective considering engineering perspective and social changes needs to develop within the field of research Awasthi and Li The introduction of internetbased collection systems has created an integrated cyberphysical space in which EM occurs with Cao et al proposing that blockchain technology could be applied in transportation and payment in the online ewaste collection system This platform can collect data on annual EEE production sales recycling amount of ewaste and these data can be used as valuable inputs for future policy formulation IT is one of the emerging research areas that requires considerable attention MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production Regarding online collection systems and formal recycling platforms further research is needed into participant perceptions especially for lowincome and loweducation participants For older people the scope and service innovations required for internetbased recycling platforms requires further attention Apart from MPs there is a knowledge gap around how consumers dispose of their other ewaste items in the collection channels Estimating acceptable collection prices as per consumer demand also requires further investigation Crosscultural studies are required to understand consumers de mand for specific ewaste collection options doortodoor council pickup permanent collection points onlinebased system and the associated need for incentives For example do citizens from China intend to behave the same when they emigrate to developed coun tries such as the USA Australia or Canada How do cultural dif ferences affect ewaste related consumer behavior eg local people vs immigrants Few studies were found that had been performed on RR behavior Further investigations are required into consumer perceptions of this issue and local government policy on the topic eg how local waste collection authorities engage consumers with repair shops and charity organizations Major inhibitors need to be investigated further from developed countries contexts Financing mechanisms for depositreturn systems is a research gap that requires further investigation The mechanism s impact on the onlinebased collection platforms and retailerbased collection needs special attention to identify optimal exchange offers for consumers MPs and other small IT and equipment require further consideration in this regard According to Wang et al the most critical factors attributed to using appropriate recovery channels are recycling habits eco nomic benefits the convenience of recycling facilities and services and residential conditions These aspects need to be considered further for urban areas in developed countries It is assumed that most consumers feel reluctant to dispose of ewaste through formal collection and recycling channels due to the considerable amount of time involved TPB was found to be one of the most widely utilized methods on the research topic Future research should pay attention to the large population size and source more representative samples from rural and urban populations Facetoface interviews should be used more often to understand other consumer behavior dimensions as this was performed in only a limited number of studies In addition it was observed that most of the studies applied TPB in the case of recycling behavior as seen in Table A in the appendix leaving further op portunities to assess consumers consumption reuse and repair and storage behavior In the case of CB TPB application could observe connection with recycling intention especially for products which are environmentallyfriendly or designed under theoretical concepts such as green phones or green vacuum cleaners Productfocused case studies involving TPB are also limited as it was observed that recycling and disposal behavior is largely associated with the prod uct type and category Solar PV panels will be an emerging ewaste stream Islam et al c Various valuable and toxic materials are present in the panels Mahmoudi et al In that case TPB application would provide a broader understanding of consumers consumption and recycling behavior Moreover other constructs of TPB might be considered in consumptionrelated issues such as product design repairability availability of recyclingoriented ser vice in a takeback system connected with a product purchase incentives and disposal convenience Nduneseokwu et al mentioned that casespecific variable integration such as situational factors psychological factors and ecofriendly values could be in tegrated into an extended TPB model These factors could be added by investigating possible interrelations between multiple behaviors at once such as storage and repair and reuse The general TPB constructs were not assessed for secondhand product purchase and in the future researchers should identify the factors associated with the consumers reuse behavior For example do peerpressure and social norms affect the RR behavior These issues were not extensively analyzed and need further attention The impactinflu ence of TPB application among the participants could be observed over time same number of samples after implementing intervention and observe the change of intentions Consumer preferences for retailerbased collection points for ewaste disposal require further attention EU WEEE Directive places a spe cific focus on retailerbased collection Directive Improving WMP collection channels and residents environmental awareness is one of the future research areas Zhang Y et al Computer and ITrelated equipment were found as dominant product categories Future research should obtain specific data via a survey on lifespan profile that eventually will help estimate EG for each category within a given region Urban mining is an essential aspect that connects with this idea and policymakers can identify oppor tunities for improvement in future policy planning from the studies Conclusion In this comprehensive literature review article consumers behav iors and awareness regarding ewaste were thoroughly reviewed by analyzing articles published in international peerreviewed jour nals The studies were categorized according to various behavioral as pects such as consumption repair and reuse storage disposal and recycling Finally the article proposed a consumercentric circular economy framework that indicates necessary policy initiatives and business model innovation opportunities towards attaining a circular economy CE in academic research focusing on ewaste One of the critical research findings is that consumers are demanding a substantial change in existing ewaste management systems Issues requiring the attention of researchers and policymakers around both product and service innovation include formal ewaste collection op tions data and information security collection prices modes of compensation service options online doortodoor curbside collec tion proximity to permanent recycling centers confidence and participation in online recycling platforms and lowcost repair Consumers awareness regarding ewaste should be raised through education and campaigns More diversified strategies involving social media and information provided at physical locations are required to have an impact on consumers storage and repair and reuse behavior A specific focus is required on frequency and content development for awarenessraising campaigns Regulatory frameworks require further attention in relation to informal sector recycling extended producer responsibility payment size and method in takeback systems public engagement provision and mandatory product stewardship schemes In developing a national EM policy regional aspects and citywide socio economic diversity should be considered rather than implementing a onesizefitsall solution To achieve better material circularity gov ernment support through tax relief and subsidies should be provided to local recycling companies and cooperation should be established be tween electronic product manufacturers and local waste management authorities Manufacturers have a role to play in the product endoflife stage and the product design stage to enhance consumer perceptions of convenient product disassembly for recycling and enhanced repairability Online product selling and exchange sites play a critical role in influencing consumption behavior In that regard the government can develop a national inventory database on categorywise product sales and sta tistical parameter identification for waste generation estimation Con sumers selling behavior and its impact on manufacturers reverse logistics operations should be considered a research opportunity Ser vice innovation in ewaste collection for the aged population and the case of small ewaste items should have a particular focus Despite the complex interdisciplinary nature of the research this MT Islam et al Journal of Cleaner Production paper provides an introductory guide to researchers investigating several issues in one single place Most importantly it is often hard to provide a generalized recommendation linking circular economy prin ciples building blocks and associated pathways as socioeconomic conditions policy and regulation are both country and culture spe cific In this case a more interdisciplinary research approach could be taken by future researchers in the field A global focus on consumer awareness and behavior towards ewaste has been considered in this review article collecting and analyzing articles published in the international peerreviewed journals As the focus topic encompasses an interdisciplinary field of research if any paper missed the WoS database keywords it might not appear in the collection and would not have been included in the analysis Future research should utilize other keywords and integrating other search engines such as scholargooglecom Extending the literature review to journals in other languages may address some of these gaps but lan guage barriers could also create difficulties around researchers learning from other nations experiences It is hoped that this paper will have value for policymakers in developing strategies and for researchers in conducting future research into the multidimensional research theme of advancing knowledge around ewaste and circular economy For future research an interdis ciplinary approach is required that seeks to understand the complex dynamics of consumer behavior including how it varies across different products and waste streams CRediT
