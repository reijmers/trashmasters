At city level, conventional statistics on waste are oftenincomplete or lack detail. Waste input-output accounting offers an alternative, using waste supply and use tables to create detailed inventories of economy-wide ﬂows of waste. In this study we develop such tables for the city-region of Brussels  and use them to analyse the urban waste metabolism interms of waste ﬂows, waste production intensity and waste treatment performance. The waste ﬂow analysis revealed: the amount of collected waste; the proportion contributed by indi- vidual sectors; the material composition of waste ﬂows and the location of treatment. Currently, around 50% of the 1.5 million tons of waste collected in Brussels is treated in local facilities. However, less than1% of the collected waste is used in a way that closes material cycles within city limits. The waste per- formance analysis reveals that the construction sector had the highest waste production intensity and the household sector the highest incineration intensity. In terms of waste prevention and local valorisa-tion potential, we identiﬁed ﬂows and sectors for future targeting, one of the most promising being food waste. We conclude that the urban context can restrict the local valorisation of waste ﬂows, thus we see the role of cities such as Brussels in a circular economy as mainly contributing to the closing of materialcycles at national or even global level. /C2112018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 1. Introduction 1.1. Waste ﬂows and the circular economy The global amounts of waste generated are estimated between 7 and 10 billion tons per year . The amount of solid waste recorded in ofﬁcial statistics is around 3.2 billion tons. It is estimated that from this amount 47% is landﬁlled, 31% recycled and 22% incinerated . Thus, almost 70% of waste is currently not reused or recycled. This represents an enormous loss of resources and explains the high pressure on global primary resources. However, not only the depletion of resources constitutes an environmental  chal- lenge, but also the impacts from the treatment of the waste repre- sent negative externalities. First of all, environmental impacts from uncontrolled disposal of waste into the environment, for example accumulation of micro plastics in the oceans threateningthe marine fauna . But also, environmental impacts from controlled waste treatment processes create environ- mental problems, for example, methane from landﬁlls that consti- tute around 4% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions  or the emissions of air pollutants from waste incineration . In order to reduce environmental pressure from waste, resource and waste management principles have been introduced into waste legislation. The most important principle implemented in the European waste legislation is the waste hierarchy establishing a priority order from prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling and energy recovery to disposal activities, such as landﬁlling ( EC, 2008 ). The waste hierarchy is a generalised, and widely accepted, environmental ranking where prevention is considered to be the most environment-friendly and landﬁll the least environment- friendly alternative. However, results from life cycle assessments  have shown that such generalization is problematic and that environmental performances show strong dependency on local speciﬁcities of the waste management systems ( Laurent et al., 2014 ). Also article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive  allows deviations from the waste hierarchy where this is justiﬁed by LCA results. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.10.034 0956-053X/ /C2112018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.⇑Corresponding authors.

Currently, the so-called circular economy  concepts are pro- moted to achieve more waste prevention and better resource man- agement by extending and closing material cycles. CE concepts are promoted at European level through the Circular Economy Pack- age, adopted by the EC in 2015, including legislative proposals and other initiatives . Important actions are the 2030 tar- gets for recycling , 70% for construction and demolition  waste, 75% for packaging waste), landﬁll restrictions , promotion of industrial symbiosis and eco-design. Even if waste prevention at source has highest priority, quantitative waste prevention tar- gets  are still lacking in European legislation. 1.2. Circular economy at city scale Due to the dynamic population and economic development in cities, the environmental pressure in terms of resource consump- tion and waste generation is especially high in cities ( Hoornweg et al., 2013 ). To improve local performances, many cities turning towards CE concepts, for example organised in the circular cities network. A current review of CE initiatives around the globe iden- tiﬁed 83 cities that promote CE, but with different targets and interests . Proximity of resources and people, a sufﬁcient scale for effective markets  and the ability to shape urban plan- ning and policy are seen as factors for the unique position of cities in CE. The geographic proximity of supply and demand is expected to have environmental beneﬁts through more efﬁcient material collec- tion cycles and more efﬁcient reverse logistic ( Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017 ). This proximity advantage is also frequently men- tioned in the context of urban symbiosis, which is based on the ‘ syn- ergistic opportunity arising from the geographic proximity of urban waste sources and potential industrial users’ through exchange of waste materials for environmental beneﬁt . Although environmental beneﬁts are mentioned in the context of urban CE, few environmental assessments of urban initiatives are available and complementary CE-related environmental research is rarely applied at city level ( Petit-Boix and Leipold, 2018 ). However, some environmental assessments of CE develop- ments at city level are available for Asian cities. For example, Fang et al.  found resources and carbon footprint savings in one of China’s national pilot cities for CE. Sun et al.  found life cycle environmental beneﬁts of urban symbiosis within a typ- ical industrial city in China and Geng et al.  found CO 2reduc- tions for urban symbiosis scenarios in Kawasaki . Comparative environmental assessments of CE activities between the city and larger scales are less frequent. Wang et al.  evaluated the performance of 40 cities in China based on an index system for CE developments (considering mainly environ- mental criteria) and found higher growth of CE in the pilot cities than in the rest of the country. Other comparative analyses are car- ried out for speciﬁc CE initiatives within cities, for example, for urban agriculture. Comparisons of urban and conventional agricul- tural systems have shown environmental beneﬁts for certain types of urban agricultural systems . However, these studies did not systematically investigate the use of urban biowaste. The case studies investigated by Sanyé-Mengual et al.  found a reduction of embodied greenhouse gases from reduced transport, packaging, and food distribution losses.However, the question about the impact of the geographical scale is not only an environmental one. It is also highly relevant for techno-economic feasibility of CE initiatives. Sterr and Ott  state that ‘ the ‘‘right size ”is the minimal size in which outputs can be retransformed into desired inputs, thereby adequately closing material loops ’. In their case study in an industrial region, any kind of material could be recycled within the regional boundaries, except of metals. However, the size of the market needs to be suf- ﬁciently large  to sustain specialized industries and to provide economically viable CE solutions. Chen et al.  found that the size of ‘recycling boundaries’ depends on the type of waste. For example, waste oil, metal, plas- tics, paper, and waste electrical and electronic equipment , are circulated in large regions , whereas organic wastes, mixed MSW, and demolition wastes, aresuitable for local recycling and recovery. According to the analysis ofChen et al.  , the determinants of recycling boundaries are the density of separated waste and the unit transportation/treat- ment cost. Waste with high market value, accumulated at low den- sity and low unit cost of transportation/treatment, such as metal and glass, are typically recycled at large scale. Waste with low mar- ket value accumulated at high density and high unit cost and trans- portation/treatment  are more suited for local recycling. However, the appropriate size of scale must be determined based on speciﬁc local conditions. 1.3. Waste and CE strategy in Brussels Since 2016 Brussels has a Regional Program for a Circular Econ- omy  that includes a set of transversal, sectorial, terri- torial and governance measures to support the city’s CE transition. The dematerialisation of the economy, implementation of extended product cycles and the reduction of environmental impacts are deﬁned as ﬁnal environmental targets of the plan. However, the local economic stimulation, i.e. the creation of local jobs and local value chains are the central criteria of the program. The sectorial measures target priority sectors like construction, resource & waste, logistics , commerce and food. For the resource & waste sector, repair and reuse are identiﬁed as core actions of local CE. The CE program is closely interlinked with Brussels’ Waste Plan. The current 4th Waste Plan  includes a waste prevention program, targets for separate collec- tion and targets for the recycling of MSW and C&D waste. It also contains quantitative waste prevention targets for food, paper, packaging, diapers, garden waste and other waste categories from households and economic sectors. In 2010, a legal obligation became effective to separately collect the recyclable fractions ofhousehold waste. In 2014 the legal obligation was extended to eco- nomic activities. Currently, the 5th Waste Plan is under develop- ment which focusses on CE and a zero waste strategy (Region de Bruxelles-Capitale, 2018 ). Despite the legal framework and dedicated programs, the mon- itoring report about MSW management in Belgium shows a low overall recycling rate for Brussels . Also more recent datasets  show an overall MSW recycling rate of around 27% for Brussels while the average Belgian performance was 54% in 2013. In Gentil  the low performance is explained by the lack of infrastructure for the treatment of organic waste and lack of collection/recycling infrastructure related to the high urban density. The city’s Waste Plan ( Bruxelles Environnement, 2010 ) states a number of constraints and challenges for the local waste manage- ment sector such as the high population density (7,434 persons per km2, the small territory  and the highly urbanized terrain (residential and service sector land use1The sufﬁcient market scale for waste/resources at city level is also discussed in the context of ‘urban mining’. Urban mining involves the systematic recovery orextraction of materials from urban areas where large stocks of materials are found, inparticular in buildings and infrastructure, end-of-life products, packaging material,and biomass .V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 84 of 63% ). These conditions limit the availability of sites and the infrastructure network necessary to build new sorting or recycling facilities. The fact that most people live in multi- apartment buildings and have no access to a private garden (share of apartments 47% of the 517.000 houses ( Bruxelles Environnement, 2010 )) is considered as a constraint for an efﬁcient waste separation and storage. The city’s economy is characterised by a high share of service and public sector (90% of gross value added ) and by a small company size. Since most companies are integrated in the urban network, it is difﬁcult to monitor the waste produced by these companies. 1.4. Data availability, accounting frameworks and analytical methods In order to study the development of innovative waste manage- ment options and implementation of CE models, detailed informa- tion on current and future waste ﬂows is needed. This requires the availability of  detailed waste  data on the amount of waste generated, collected and treated,  accounting frameworks to link waste with other relevant ﬂows  in a coherent manner and  analytical tools to assess performances. Regarding data availability, Hage and Söderholm  state that waste management analyses should rely on local data, but that data availability at city-region level is often problematic. Also Prendeville et al.  identiﬁed a lack of access to data as a key barrier to the implementation of initiatives in cities. More speciﬁ- cally, the availability of waste  data at the local and regional scale is challenging in terms of data coverage (households and economic activities), detail , spatial/sector resolution and temporal completeness . Regarding the availability of accounting frameworks that link waste with production and consumption data, methodological pro- gress has been achieved in the last years and an international stan- dard, the system of environmental economic accounts  has been developed. Economy-wide material ﬂow accountings  which are published by most European countries since 2014, are part of this framework. These datasets have improved the data availability on physical material ﬂows, but data is highly aggregated and reported at country scale only. For Brussels, a metabolism study is available that has used the EW-MFA frame- work . The solid material inputs, addi- tion to the net stock, and the output ﬂows  were quantiﬁed and complemented by an energy and water balance . More detailed datasets in terms of sector resolution are input-output  frameworks, which are also part of the SEEA. In conventional IO frameworks, product and service ﬂows betweeneconomic sectors and towards the ﬁnal demand sectors are mea- sured in monetary terms. Waste treatment services are accounted, but ﬂows of waste  are not avail- able. In order to account for waste ﬂows and to assess impacts of waste treatment processes Nakamura and Kondo  developed the waste input-output model . It is a conceptual framework to include physical waste ﬂows into the monetary IO-framework. The WIO model was further developed into several directions:  towards a model where also the product ﬂows are accounted in physical units ,  towards a model where waste ﬂows are integrated into a monetary supply and use model  and towards an multiregional monetary supply and use model . Although the theoretical foundation of WIO models and the development towards material ﬂows accountings have been intro- duced since more than 15 years, to date only few databases are available that provide complementary physical and monetary data. An exception is the EXIOBASE database, a global multi-regionalenvironmentally extended IO database, available in a monetary and physical  version ( Tukker et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2014 ). At the sub-national level, for example the city-level, such detailed IO-datasets, but even the aggregated EW-MFA are hardly available. To analyse product and waste ﬂows at the scale of an economy, material ﬂow analysis  and input–output analysis  are used as analytical methods. Material Flow Analysis is ‘‘ a systematic assessment of the ﬂows and stocks of materials within a system deﬁned in space and time ”’ . The basic principle of MFA is the mass balance stating that the inputs into a system must equal the outputs . Regarding its original area of application, Brunner and Rechberger  specify  the metabolism of cities and  the analysis of pollutantpathways. Guibrunet et al.  deﬁne urban metabolism as ‘‘framework that takes material ﬂows as the unit of analysis to describe patterns of natural resources transformation in cities ”. The urban metabolism gives a holistic view on all activities in a city including all inputs, stocks, and outputs of materials and energy. While the standard urban metabolism study represents an analysis of the status quo at a certain time point, recently the framework of dynamic urban metabolism has been developed ( Athanassiadis et al., 2017 ). The urban metabolism aims to give a general picture of ﬂows, one of the output ﬂows being waste ﬂows. The waste metabolism is a type of analysis that studies speciﬁcally the ﬂows of waste from generation to treatment. D’Alisa et al.  suggest the use of new indicators to describe the waste metabolism: the meta- bolic rate of waste and the density of waste. The waste metabolic rate indicates the pace of waste generated or disposed per hour of human activity. The density of waste indicates the amount of waste generated, separately collected or disposed per day in a given area. Browne et al.  suggest to use the materials meta- bolic inefﬁciency indicator which relates the ﬁnal disposal of mate- rial and product wastes to consumption in order to determine sectoral inefﬁciency. The use of new waste performance indicators and the graphical representation of waste ﬂows as metabolic net- work composed of ﬂows and functional nodes  are the main characteristics of the waste metabolic analysis con- ducted by Chifari et al.  .  input-output analysis  is an analytical method to calculate direct and indirect economic and environmental impacts induced by ﬁnal consumption. When input–output analyses  are applied to waste input-output models, the generation and treatment of physical waste ﬂows can be calculated. Recent examples of such studies, called waste footprints, include the analysis of solid waste generation and treat-ment at global level , cumulative waste pro- duction induced by Australian consumers o r waste induced by consumption of Tokyo residents ( Tsukui et al., 2015 ). Waste performance indicators that can be derived from waste IOA are the multipliers from the direct and total require- ment matrices that determine the waste production and treatment intensity of sectors. Fry et al.  , for example, use the waste production multipliers  to compare the sectoral waste production intensity and found signiﬁcant differences between two domestic regions. 1.5. Objective and scope of the study The aim of this research is to analyse the current state of Brus- sels’ waste management system and to identify its waste preven- tion and CE valorisation potential. The scope of the study includes all kind of non-hazardous, solid waste collected from households and economic activities. We develop waste supply85 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 and use tables for Brussels and use this framework it to analyse the city’s waste metabolism, because it provides an economy-wide scope while maintaining the high sector detail that is required for an analysis of waste performance and valorisation potential. Section 2 presents the data and method used to construct waste supply and use tables at the city level. Section 3 presents results from the waste metabolic analysis, including the waste ﬂow tables and a Sankey diagram, as well as waste performance indicators. We also discuss the outcomes in terms of CE valorisation potential. Section 4 presents the conclusions that can be drawn from the dif- ferent analyses. 2. Data and methods In this study, we use the WIO framework to perform the anal- ysis of waste ﬂow and waste performance. The various waste tables that are part of the accounting framework offer different perspectives on the ﬂows of waste: a waste-type, sector- and treatment-speciﬁc perspective. The ﬁrst step of our approach was to complete data and to estimate the total amount of col- lected waste . This completed dataset fed into the second step, the construction of the detailed waste supply and use tables . In step 3, we developed the waste treatment allo-cation table for Brussels  followed by the construction of the waste supply to treatment table . In the last step, we aggre- gated data from the different tables to visualise them in a Sankey diagram . The waste performance indicators selected in this study are presented in 2.6. 2.1. Data collection and treatment 2.1.1. Waste statistical data Due to its status as city-region, statistical data on MSW is avail- able. MSW, which represents around 30% of the total waste, includes household and similar commercial, industrial and institu- tional waste collected by or on behalf of municipal authorities. Thus, the fractions not similar to household waste (C&D waste, metal scraps, vehicles, etc.) or the waste collected by private oper- ators  are not included. For these waste frac- tions only estimations of the waste amounts exist, presented in highly aggregated waste categories (for example ‘waste from com- panies and administration’, ‘other waste’). In order to improve the initial data situation and to determine the total amount of solid, non-hazardous waste collected in Brus- sels, we collected data from the three entities involved in the waste management or in the monitoring of waste data:  the regionalagency ‘ Bruxelles-Propreté’ who is the main collector of MSW,  ‘Bruxelles Environnement ’, the environmental administration of Brussels in charge of the waste register monitoring all waste types that need to be registered and  the statistical ofﬁce ‘ Recydata ’ that monitors waste ﬂows collected by private collectors . The collected datasets were analysed and then combined into a joint database . It contains detailed data on solid, non-hazardous waste collected in 2010 and 2014 and is available in two formats: The ﬁrst one represents the waste collection system operating in Brussels where waste data is measured in, for example, tons of mixed residual waste col- lected in white bags/container. The second format is waste-type speciﬁc and represents materials, such as glass, inert, metals, etc. This waste-type speciﬁc dataset was calculated from the original data by applying waste composition ratios from composition anal- yses , 2015; RECYDATA, 2017 ). Table 1 presents the amounts of waste in the waste-type speciﬁc format.2.1.2. Input-output tables For Belgium, interregional supply and use tables as well as input-output tables are available, which model the economic ﬂows of products between Brussels, the two other Belgian regions (i.e. the Walloon and Flemish region), Europe and non-Europe. The original interregional model available from the Belgian statistical authorities , was developed by disaggregating the national input-output system by means of top-down methods and consistent with the Regional Accounts. The regional supply tables specify the monetary output for each economic sector in the three Belgian regions. The model was extended by environ- mental data and coupled with EXIOBASE for the import ﬂows . In the extended model, Brussels’ economy is struc- tured into 81 sectors  that produce and consume 81 types of products and services. This economic input–outputframework that follows the sector classiﬁcation, listed in the sup- plementary material , builds the general structure for the developed waste extensions . 2.2. Waste supply and use tables This section describes the construction of the waste supply and use tables. In our accounting based on waste statistical data, waste is deﬁned in a narrow sense without by-products or recovered prod-ucts or materials 2.Table 2 shows the layout of the waste supply table ) for Brussels. It is a waste type by economic activity table whose components wðsÞkjand wðsÞkfshow the amount of waste type k(in ton) generated by an economic activity jor by the ﬁnal demand sec- tors f. The data and methodology to construct the waste supply table for Brussels 81 economic activities is documented in . In brief, we distributed the statistical data from Table 1 over economic activities and households based on a waste- type speciﬁc allocation key. To derive this key, we calculated sector- speciﬁc waste intensities from the Belgian dataset in EXIOBASE v. 2  and scaled them to the economic output of each sector that is given in Brussels’ supply data . The results, i.e. the estimated amounts per type of waste and per sector, are then expressed as percentage contributions to the total waste gen- eration for a speciﬁc type of waste. For example, the allocation key for food waste allocates 8% of the food waste from economic activities to the hotels, restaurants and catering sector . The total waste supply wðsÞkis given by wðsÞk¼X jwðsÞkjþwðsÞkf ð1ÞTable 1 Total waste quantities collected in Brussels in 2010 and 2014 . 2010  2014  Variation  Glass 38,507 39,097 1.5 Inert 625,244 652,869 4.4Metals 191,144 200,317 4.8Food waste 160,182 160,014 /C00.1 Paper & cardboard 192,170 186,900 /C02.7 Plastic 105,313 102,625 /C02.6 Textile 23,316 25,660 10.1Wood 64,131 63,276 /C01.3 Garden 35,103 41,305 17.7 Other 82,450 66,558 /C019.3 Total 1,517,561 1,538,620 1.4 2Waste that is sent to reuse and recovery is included, for example plastic waste that is sent to a sorting facility. The recovered materials from a treatment activity, i.e. the outputs of the material recovery sector  thatare going to be used in the manufacturing sector are not additionally accounted as waste, but as an economic product ﬂow. By-products constitute a fraction of around 15% of the total products supplied in Brusselsin 2010 .V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 86 Table 3 shows the structure of the waste use table ). It is a waste type by economic activity table whose components show the use of waste wuðÞkjin the local waste treatment sectors or the use of waste wuðÞkfin an exterior waste treatment sector (i.e. waste export). Compared to other authors ( Nakamura and Kondo, 2002 ), we account the use of waste only in a waste treatment activity, not in another sector. This difference is closely linked to the deﬁnition of waste given above: When by-products and recov- ered materials are not included, only the conventional waste treat- ment sectors use waste as an input. The total amount of waste treated wðuÞkis given by wðuÞk¼X jwðuÞkjþwðuÞkf ð2Þ The waste treatment sector in Brussels consists of the material recovery, incineration and composting sector. Other possible waste treatment sectors  do not exist in Brussels and are therefore not mentioned as economic activitiesinTable 3 . The material recovery sector is a heterogeneous sector grouping  dismantling activities and  mechanical or chemical transformation processes, also including separating and sorting of recoverable materials . The sector is called ‘preparation for material recovery’ in the following in order to emphasize that the activities carried out in Brussels are mainly separation, sorting and dismantling activities. In order to determine the input-output ﬂows of this sector, we collected physical and economic data from companies assigned to this sector 3. The total amounts of waste incinerated and compostedare published in annual reports . The material composition of waste incinerated was derived from waste bags/container composition analyses ( Agence Bruxelles Proprété , 2015; RECYDATA, 2017 ). The amount of exported waste was calculated by subtracting the amounts of waste treated in Brussels from the total amounts of waste collected. Thus, in the waste use table, the export column is a balancing item and repre- sents the theoretical direct export of waste. When accounting also for the export of recovered products from the local material recov- ery sector , the export share is signif- icantly higher. 2.3. Waste treatment allocation table W and W determine the amounts of waste collected and the total amounts of waste used in the waste treatment sectors. They do not determine how a certain waste type produced by a certain sector is treated. In order to make this correspondence between generation and treatment at sector level, an additional table is needed that determines waste treatment rates per waste type. The so-called waste treatment allocation table , introduced byNakamura and Kondo  , is a waste treatment by waste type table whose components sikshow the share of waste type k that is treated by a certain treatment method i. The sum of waste treatment shares for a speciﬁc waste type kis 1. To determine the waste-speciﬁc treatment rates, we used vari- ous sources. Data on the destination of waste from economic activ- ities is taken from the waste register ( Bruxelles Environnement, 2016 ), a monitoring study , and based on direct contacts with waste collectors and waste treatment facilities. For household and assimilated waste, data from the public agency ABP that monitors the treatment of MSW is used ( Agence Bruxelles Proprété , 2016 ). The use of such datasets toTable 2 Structure of the waste supply table. HH = Households, EA = Economic activity. Table 3 Structure of the waste use table .

After determining the treatment processes for an aggregated waste ﬂows , the ﬂows weredisaggregated per waste type. Table 4 presents the waste treat- ment shares per waste type for economic activities, Table 5 for households. We distinguished the local treatment modes (prepara- tion for material recovery, reuse, incineration and composting) and the exterior treatment processes which include also anaerobic digestion, landﬁll and the category ‘unknown’ if the ﬁnal destina- tion of the waste could not be determined. The low landﬁll rate is a result of Belgium’s high landﬁll tax (one of the highest landﬁll taxes in Europe), combined with a landﬁll ban for several selected waste streams . 2.4. Waste supply to treatment table When multiplying  from the left by W, we receive the waste supply to treatment table ). More precisely, the treat- ment shares for economic activities ( s ikfrom S1) are multiplied by the waste collected from economic activities . Accordingly, the treatment shares for households  are multiplied by waste collected from households .Table 6 shows the structure of the resulting table.

Data aggregation To visualise the ﬂows of waste from origin to their destination we constructed a Sankey diagram based on aggregated data from Table 7 and 9 . Sankey diagrams visualise energy or material ﬂows by scaling the size of the ﬂows  proportional to the ﬂow quantity . For the purpose of clarity, the 81 economic activities have been aggregated into 10 groups, such as primary industries, manufactur- ing, construction, etc. The correspondence table  shows the alignment of economic activities to the 10 aggregated groups. We mainly follow the aggregation proposed by the hierar- chical levels used in the NACE system, but extended the group fur- ther if the waste amount was too small to be displayed (example: the ‘energy and water’ sector was included into ‘manufacturing’). In addition to the 10 aggregated economic activities, we added the household sector and a further grouped sector called ‘non- speciﬁed economic activity’. This sector contains ﬂows which could not be aligned to a speciﬁc economic activity.Table 4 Waste treatment allocation table  for economic activities .

These waste service providers have to declare the amount  and type of collected waste, and the destination of the waste. In the speciﬁc case of Brussels, an anonymized version of this dataset could beaccessed by the researchers, but it needed to be combined with other data sources to identify and solve declarations errors and eliminate doublecounting .V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 88 In order to visualise local material cycles we also added to the diagram the ﬂows of the secondary waste from incineration (i.e. bottom ash, ﬂy ash, metal residues etc.) and ﬂows of secondary raw materials  produced in Brussels. The numerical tables behind the Sankey are given in sup- plement 3. 2.6. Waste performance indicators To measure and compare the waste performance of the city’s sectors, the two indicators ‘waste production intensity’ and ‘waste treatment intensity’ are chosen, because they measure two impor- tant aspects of a sector’s performance: the sector’s waste efﬁ- ciency in terms of amount of waste and type of treatment. The waste production intensity reﬂects the sector’s production efﬁ- ciency and is expressed as a ratio between waste and production. It is calculated by dividing each component of the waste supply table wðsÞkj by the economic activity output xjfrom Brussels’ supply table. The waste intensity is measured in ton per M €sector output. In order to take into account not only the amounts of generated waste, but also the type of treatment, the waste treatment inten- sity is used as second indicator. It refers to the amount of wasteproduced by a sector  that is sent to a speciﬁc treatment . It is calculated by divid- ing each component of the supply to treatment table ws tðÞ ij by the economic activity output xjfrom Brussels’ supply table. The waste treatment intensity is also measured in ton per M €sec- tor output. Since the economic sector output is only available for 2010, the waste coefﬁcients are calculated for 2010. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Waste ﬂow analysis3.1.1. Waste supply and use tables The results of the waste supply table for Brussels are shown in Table 7 . The ten waste types are broad categories containing differ- ent ‘product’ types produced by households and economic activi- ties. For example, ‘glass’ includes ﬂat glass from end of life vehicles and from C&D activities, but also packaging glass disposed by households and the hotels and restaurant sector. The category ‘inert’ contains concrete, bricks, tiles and ceramics, inert mixture, asphalt, soil and stones. The category ‘other’ is a mixed fraction consisting mostly of ‘complex packaging’, ‘ﬁne particles’ or ‘street cleaning residues’. The total amount of waste collected in 2014 is around 1.5 mil- lion tons, from which 71% is generated by economic activities and29% by households. Table 7 shows that households are the most important contributor for glass, food, textile and garden waste, while inert, metal and paper and cardboard are mainly produced by economic activities. The sector-speciﬁc results are too detailed to be reproduced here, but available in the supplementary material (supplement 4). The results show that only for inert waste a large share (31% of inert waste) can be aligned to one particular sector, the con- struction sector. For the other waste types, the amounts are more widely distributed over economic activities. For example, for paper waste, the public administration, ﬁnancial intermediation and the other business services have a share of 15%, 11% and 9% respec- tively and the remaining part is distributed over 62 economic activities. When discussing the quality of this detailed sector repartition, we point to the following sources of uncertainties: First, for certain sectors the local economic output speciﬁed in the supply table could be higher than their real production (so called ‘head quarter problem’) and second, the national waste intensity could under- or overestimate the regional waste intensity. Previous comparison between estimations based on waste coefﬁcient approach and sta- tistical data  have shown that uncertainties occur mainly for metals, glass and inert waste. Table 8 shows the amount of waste used in the local waste treatment facilities  and the amount of waste exported to waste treatment facilities located out of Brussels. Around 770 kt of waste  is treated in Brussels, the remaining 50% is directly exported. Regarding the data quality, it has to be mentioned that the totals for incineration and compost- ing represent accurate numbers measured by the treatment facili- ties, while the quantity for the ‘preparation for material recovery’sector and the detailed, waste-type speciﬁc inputs represents esti- mations obtained from the sources previously described ( Agence Bruxelles Proprété , 2016 ; Bruxelles Propreté, 2016; RECYDATA, 2017, 2014 ). Table 9 is the waste supply to treatment table that shows treatment- and sector-speciﬁc results. Most waste collected from households is used in the local treatment facilities while waste col- lected from economic activities is mainly exported. The treatment options ‘export to incineration, unknown, landﬁll and compost’ occur for waste from economic activities only. These variations in treatment between economic activities and the household sector result from the different collection schemes and actors (public/pri- vate) responsible for the collection of waste. When comparing the amount of waste sent to the local ‘preparation of material recovery’ sector and to the local incinerator, indicated in Table 9 , with the corresponding data from Table 8 , we ﬁnd that the calculated amounts in Table 9 are slightly lower than the ones ‘measured’ in the use tables. This indicates that incineration rates and materialTable 6 Waste supply to treatment table. HH = Households, EA = Economic activity.89 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 recovery shares that are used in the calculation are slightly under- estimated for certain waste fractions. However, the overall mass balance between the three tables ) is maintained. 3.1.2. Waste ﬂow analysis  To represent waste ﬂows in a Sankey diagram, we used aggre- gated versions of Table 7 andTable 9 . On the left of the dia- gram  the origin of waste is shown, represented by 12 sector groups. The size of each sector box represents the contribution of each sector to the total amount of waste collected in Brussels. We observe that households and construction are the most impor- tant contributing sectors to the total waste ﬂow, representing 29%and 16% respectively. The composition of each sector’s waste ﬂow is represented by several single ﬂow arrows leaving the sector box. We can see that the collected waste from households is heteroge- neously composed, in contrast to the waste from the construction sector that is dominated by inert waste. The single waste ﬂows end in a waste treatment activity, which might be located within or outside of Brussels. The sum ﬂow arrows indicate the contribution of each waste treatment activity to the overall waste management system: 27% of the total collected waste goes to the incinerator, 11% to inert recovery, 10% to other intermediate treatment processes (such as PMD, paper and textile sorting and metal recovery) and 1% to the city’s compostingTable 7 Waste supply table .

Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 90 facility. Thus, in total around 50% of the collected waste is treated within the city limits. The remaining waste is sent out of Brussels to be treated: 5% goes to landﬁll5, 36% is recycled and the remaining 9% is subject to other treatment processes (composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration and unknown). In addition to all of these primary waste ﬂows, we also included the secondary waste ﬂow from incineration indicating the proportion that is landﬁlled or sent to recycling. The diagonal-shaded ﬂows in Fig. 1 show secondary raw mate- rials or products recovered from the intermediate treatment pro- cesses. These materials and products are mostly exported to recycling facilities in Belgium, Europe or the rest of the world, with only a small amount being reused at city level: 6kt of compost , 1.5ktof textiles, 1kt of wood, 0.6kt of plastics and 0.3kt of metals. This means that less than 1% of the total collected waste is used in a way that closes material cycles at city level. In addition to these local material cycles, the incineration plant with energy recovery could be considered as a local energy cycle. Around 5% of Brussels’ households can be supplied with electricity from the incinerator. This energy ﬂow is not represented in this mass-related Sankey diagram. The sum ﬂow arrows for waste and secondary raw material on the right of the diagram show the current state of waste treatment in terms of the quantity dealt with by each treatment mode and whether this occurs within or outside the city. Nonetheless, as pre- viously mentioned, the data (and therefore by deﬁnition the anal- ysis) has certain limitations. It is based on the quantities of collected waste and does not take account of products being reused before collection. For example, this is why we see textile reuse in the form of clothes collected in containers and afterwards  reused, but not clothes sold second-hand. Likewise, the data does not account for products that are sold on markets, sold between individuals or that are donated. Due to the variety ofproducts and reuse exchange possibilities, this part of the CE which is already in place could not be quantiﬁed and is not represented in the diagram 6. Furthermore, since the diagram aims to present the origin and ﬁnal destination of waste ﬂows, intermediate collection points or ﬂows between the waste treatment facilities are not illustrated. For example, sorting residues from the PMD and paper sorting facility that are sent to incineration are not illustrated as a separate ﬂow between sorting facility and incinerator, but included in the input ﬂows to the incineration plant. In reality, 250 registered actors participate in waste collection and treatment in Brussels, and various interactions occur between actors. 3.2. Waste performance analysis In this section we analyse the waste performance of the city’s sectors based on two indicators: the waste production and the waste treatment intensity . Table 10 shows the waste production intensity (measured in ton/M €) for the aggregated sectors . Since the primary sec- tor has almost no practical relevance for Brussels, we can exclude it from the discussion. The results show that the service sectors have a lower waste production intensity (between 2.72 ton/M €to 8.86 ton/M €) compared to the other sectors . The waste intensity of the manufacturing sector is slightly lower  than the transport and communication sector. This indicates that Brussels’ manufacturing sector has few production- intensive industries. The household sector has the second highest waste production intensity. The highest intensity occurs for the construction sector, due to its high share of  inert waste. When comparing sectors by waste type, we ﬁnd highest inten- sity for glass waste in the Horeca sector. For inert, metals and wood waste the waste production intensity is highest in the construction Comp.= composting; Inc.= inci neration; AD.= Anaerobic digestion  Fig. 1. Sankey diagram of waste and secondary raw material ﬂows . Comp. = composting; Inc. = incineration; AD. = Anaerobic digestion. 5The low landﬁll rate is a general pattern in Belgium, where around 8% of the total waste was landﬁlled in 2014 .6An estimation of the second hand market in UK has shown amounts of around 180kt of products sold on car boot and furniture reuse markets  which represents 0.1% compared to the annually non-hazardous waste generated.91 V. Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 sector; for food, paper and plastic waste in the household sector and for textile waste in the sector ‘other non-sales services’. Table 11 shows the waste treatment intensity (measured in ton/M €) for the aggregated sectors. Again, we can ignore the results for the primary sector. The treatment intensity results from the speciﬁc mix of waste produced by a sector and the waste-type speciﬁc treatment rates. Households show the highest intensity of incineration, but also second highest intensity of local material recovery. The construction sector has highest local material recov- ery rates . The regional material recovery consists mainly of sorting and crushing activities of the inert fraction. The produced recycled aggregates are used in various applications, for instance, for road base and ﬁlling materi-als in road construction . The two presented indicators show the direct waste intensity, i.e. the amount of waste produced directly by an economic activity or households, without including waste generated upstream in the supply chain as a result of products supplied to the sector. The direct waste production intensity has been analysed by various authors, but the comparison of values is difﬁcult due to differences in sector classiﬁcation and monetary reference values. For exam- ple, Reynolds et al.  found highest waste intensity for the construction sector, but in the aggregated results it is classiﬁed as a service sector, so that service sectors have highest direct waste intensities. High direct waste intensities for the primary, construc- tion, and transport and communication sectors were also found by Reynolds et al.  and Nakamura et al.  . Regarding the waste treatment intensity, comparisons with other studies reveal strong differences due to different waste treatment schemesestablished in the respective region under study. For example, the comparison between countries in Tisserant et al.  reveals that recycling is the dominant treatment method in many European countries while it is landﬁll in, for example, Brazil, Mexico or Russia, and incineration in Japan. 3.3. Circular economy valorisation and waste prevention potential The results from waste supply and use tables and the associated Sankey diagram were used to identify the non-exploited valorisa- tion potential of Brussels’ waste ﬂows. This is important informa- tion for decision-makers implementing CE models. Regarding the ranking of treatment/valorisation options, we rely on the gener- alised environmental ranking of the waste hierarchy . Since waste prevention at source is the highest priority in the Euro- pean and regional waste plans, we also interpreted the results in terms of their waste prevention potential. When using Fig. 1 to identify potential waste prevention options, the sector contribution and waste composition analysis can provide useful information. The household sector was identi- ﬁed as the most important single contributor  and sector with second highest waste production intensity. The household sector is also the main focus of the current prevention strategy in Brussels’ Waste Plan. However, when considering the total waste ﬂow for the city, the importance of the remaining sectors (eco- nomic activities) becomes evident: Especially, the construction sector that is the second highest single contributor  and the sector with highest waste production intensity. The adminis- tration and education sector  isTable 10 Waste production intensity .

Zeller et al. / Waste Management 83  83–94 92 also an important target sector for prevention measures. However, waste production intensity is lower than for example the one from households. The current Waste Plan provides quantitative preven- tion targets for food, paper and plastic, but when comparing these priorities with the composition of the waste ﬂows, we note that the biggest ﬂow in terms of mass is missing: the inert waste ﬂow. Thus, it is clear that prevention policies need to be extended to all waste types and need to target economic activities as well. When analysing the Sankey to identify new CE valorisation options with the priority on material recovery as suggested by the waste hierarchy, we focus on the waste treatment options that do not yet close material cycles . When applying this focus ,we identify the possibility to redirect waste ﬂows from the incinerator towards material reuse or recycling as measure with highest potential for Brussels. The reduction ofwaste ﬂows going to the incinerator implies to increase the sorting efﬁciency at source, but also to expand the options of separate sort- ing. In this context, one stream is of particular importance due to its size and current treatment: the ﬂow of food waste that is cur- rently incinerated. Separate collection of this stream and valorisa- tion in composting or anaerobic digestion could contribute to the closing of material cycles. When discussing the options for the local CE valorisation poten- tial, which is the focus adopted by the regional CE plan , it is helpful to distinguish between  preparation for material recovery  and material recovery/reprocessing. The existing local facilities and actors, active in the collection and sorting of textiles, bulky waste, dismantling of WEEE or separation of plastic, paper and metals, belong to the ﬁrst type of valorisation. The extension of such activities would imply to increase the amount of products with reuse or recycling potential, for example by improving access to collection points, by improving separation at source and exten- sion of collections that maintain product quality. Furthermore, the local sorting/dismantling infrastructure could be extended, for example by an additional sorting line for plastics that are not sep- arated and recycled today, bulky waste sorting or WEEE dismantling. However, the implementation of the second type of valorisation can be limited at city scale by techno-economic constraints, as dis- cussed in 1.2. Only speciﬁc waste types, such as organic wastes, mixed MSW, and demolition wastes are considered to be suitable for local material recycling and energy recovery. Thus, setting again the priority on the unexploited potential for material recov- ery, the highest CE valorisation potential occurs for organic waste by extending the existing composting capacity, to invest in anaer- obic digestion or in a combination of both. The export of waste to composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration facilities outside of Brussels should be avoided if local valorisation is priority. How-ever, potential changes in the waste management system need to be further assessed based on LCAs that consider not only the potential beneﬁts of avoided transport, but also the efﬁciency of the complete waste treatment chain. 4. Conclusions and outlook By using the waste input-output framework, we were able to close data gaps and to increase the level of detail in the waste data. This could contribute in empirically identifying the waste ﬂows with the most promising CE valorisation potential for cities such as Brussels. The valorisation potential was identiﬁed here based on the generalised ranking of the waste hierarchy and needs to be completed by an LCA that compares the environmental perfor- mances of different valorisation options. The datasets we developed enabled us to perform waste-type, sector- and treatment-speciﬁc analyses of urban waste ﬂows.Compared with conventional EW-MFAs based on statistical data, the urban waste metabolism presented in this study is more detailed and offers more possibilities in terms of its application. However, this increase in detail comes at a cost; the procedures of data conversion, alignment and disaggregation inherently resulted in additional uncertainties. Highest uncertainties occur for metals, glass and inert waste amounts and their distribution over economic sectors. Furthermore, a general limitation of the approach is that the starting point is the amount of collected waste and not the amount of used products. Thus, the role of CE measures based on products could not be fully captured in this study. This limitation could be reduced by extending the waste input-output framework to phys- ical product ﬂows. In this study we have developed waste supply and use tables as independent tables appended to economic supply and use tables that monitor product ﬂows. However, to use the full analytical power of IO analyses, i.e. to calculate waste footprints and environ- mental impacts, the integration of these tables into the product ﬂow matrix is needed, as demonstrated in Lenzen and Reynolds  and Nakamura and Kondo  . This study could ﬁnd few examples of systems which closed material cycles at city level. However, Brussels has adopted a CE plan in 2016 only. To increase the rates of reuse and of material recycling, we identiﬁed target streams and proposed measures to exploit the unused valorisation potential. However, when consid- ering the context of cities with a highly urbanized terrain, it becomes evident that closing material cycles at city level may only work to a certain extent and is limited to certain ﬂows. Thus we see the role of cities  in a CE mainly as provider of reusable products, recyclable materials (such as paper, plastics, metals, glass) and nutrients from organic waste rather than circu- larity islands. Whether the closing of material cycles at city level has environmental beneﬁts compared to the national or global level, needs to be further assessed based on comparative LCA studies.
