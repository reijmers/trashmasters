dce method to investigate the tradeoffs households make between variouscharacteristicsofdifferentwastesortingschemesdceisawell suited method for eliciting preferences for outcomes which can be de scribed by a set of attributes the method has been widely used in differentfieldshowevertothebestofourknowledgeitsapplications for quantifying household preferences for waste sorting schemes are still limited except a few examples karousakis and birol czajkowski et al lee et al this paper makes a contribution to the field in a number of ways firstly in previous environmental economic studies investigatinghousehold preferences for waste separation the waste sorting system has been largely described by the number of fractions to sort for ex ample fraction no sorting required fractions fractions and so on egczajkowski et al in the present paper we investigate how households preferences for waste sorting schemes may differ according to the specific waste categories household waste consists of many different waste types and the environmental externalities and scope for resource reutilisation varies significantly across categories focusing only on the number of sorting fractions is insufficient for environmental economic evaluation of alternative sorting systems in thispaperweincludeattributestoexplicitlyindicatethetypesofwasteto sort hazardous waste eg chemicals batteries paint nail vanish plasticsandbiowastetoreflectthediversityofthewastesortingbio waste is a relevant case as biowaste makes up the large share of the total household waste quantity eg riber et al moreover the sorting of biowaste might exert inconvenience to households due tohygiene and unpleasant odours especially during hot summer seasons eggilli et al the degree of inconvenience can be an im portant factor reducing households waste sorting and has been esti mated in monetary terms the socalled inconvenience cost using dce lee et al batteries other hazardous waste and plastics present important environmental risk as these are among waste frac tions with high content of hazardous chemical substances including mercury hg lead pb and cadmium cd riber et al fur thermore while recycling of plastics is currently increasing the en vironmental and economic rationales are being debated craighill and powell gradus et al secondly in the existing economic literature time has been sug gested as a relevant variable in explaining households waste sorting behaviour eg kipperberg huhtala gilli et al however the explicit treatment of time in the designs of previousstudieshasbeenlimitedifnotnonexistentthedesignoftheresearch forthepresentpapermakesitpossibletomakeanexplicitassessmentof the cost of time incurred by households which can potentially be in cluded in costbenefit analyses of alternative household waste sorting systems thirdly while previous studies are largely more local in the coverage eg specific neighbourhood a city the analysis for the present paper draws from a danish nationwide survey with a large sample size n as such the present study encompasses the variation in preferences among households representing the

resident would have much higher probability for choosingrecyclingoverincinerationhuhtalasfindingspointto income as an important determinant of the household preferences where high income households

showsthatyoungerpeopleexpresshigherinconveniencecostcompared with the older people kipperberg and larson employed a contingent rating ex periment and evaluated household preferences over five community recycling programs reflecting anticipated policy changes in the com munity recycling system in seattle variation in the five programs was characterized by differences in the expected overall recycling rate and the estimated cost that each household has to bear per month they reported variations in individual preferences and over the recycling programs their analysis also showed socioeconomic and attitude fac tors as determinants of the heterogeneity in respondents preferences across different community recycling programs for example their findings showed that introducing a food waste recycling program was not particularly appealing to older respondents and male respondents while a positive preference was observed for respondents with higher educationallevelwhilethefindingsof huhtala clearlyshowed income as an important explanatory factor for household waste recycling preferences the findings of kipperberg and larson d nainggolan et al

significant for one specificprogramnamelytheprohibitionofmixingrecyclableitemsinto general waste a study from the uk showed statistically insignificant relationship between recycling rate and income

doing so incurs cost including efforts and time to the respondents to illustrate of their re spondents display a positive preference for sorting their household waste into five categories compared to not doing any sorting previousresearchhasshownthathouseholdchoicestotakepartin more demanding waste handling schemes such as recycling can be explained by a multitude of factors household

czajkowski et al these activities also incur extra household expenses eg due to the use of warm water for cleaning some of the materials eg bruvoll et al the provision of waste collection set up and
