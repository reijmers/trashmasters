3.1. Implementation of Circular Economy Concept
In Poland, it will not be possible to achieve the above-mentioned high recycling rates
provided for in the Circular Economy Package (in particular for raw materials) using only
MBT installations. These raw materials should be collected selectively. The reason for this
is simple. Unfortunately, the waste separated in the MBT installation is only theoretically
suitable for recycling because of the content of moisture and contaminants. According to
the data of the Regional Municipal Waste Processing Plants Council (RIPOK Council) and
the Rekopol Recovery Organization, we are currently able to selectively collect about 32%
of the mass of generated municipal waste. Is it possible to achieve the 65% recycling in
Polish conditions?
Therefore, it was decided to make a mass balance of municipal waste collected and
processed in Poland on the basis of the known morphology of municipal waste, the amount
of municipal waste generated in the country per capita and demographic data on the
number of residents.
Taking into account the current dynamics of the increase in the amount of municipal
waste generated in Poland, it has been assumed that around 2025 we will achieve the level
of municipal waste generation at approximately 14.5 million Mg and that, similarly to the
more developed EU countries, its production will stabilize at this level.
Then, three variants of the implementation of the circular economy assumptions in
the Ô¨Åeld of municipal waste in Poland were analyzed:
 Variant I‚Äîachieving a level of separate collection equal to the required recycling
targets for individual waste fractions in line with the requirements of the circular
economy (paper and cardboard‚Äî85%, ferrous metals‚Äî80%, aluminum‚Äî60%, glass‚Äî
75%, plastics‚Äî55%, wood‚Äî30%.);
