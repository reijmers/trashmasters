3.1. Main Approaches to Zero-Waste Production Management in Industrial Energy Use
The conducted survey made it possible to identify the most common and “less popular”
problem-prone areas in the development of zero-waste energy production in manufacturing. The use
of recovered energy and reduction of energy losses under load conditions and in distribution lines
could be classiﬁed as category one. One of the problem-prone areas is the process of decision-making
on entering energy markets (Figure 3).
According to the experts who took part in the survey, the use of recovered energy that constitutes
companies’ own internal sources of fuel and energy in today’s conditions makes it possible to “minimize
market price risks in a situation of externally supplied energy”, “to improve the reliability and ﬂexibility
of power supply”, “to increase the economic and energy e ciency of the core technological processes”,
