According to the results of Section 4, after applying the SBA model to SIGNUS
(Table 3), it is possible to determine that 3.67% of GHG emissions are linked to reuse
processes, a high percentage, 95.82 %, to those of recycling, of which 53.26% is to obtain
materials to reintroduce them into the system and 42.56% is to produce energy. The total
environmental impact measured in terms of CF is 13,066.85 t CO 2e,an impact derived from
the additional activities incorporated into the tire production system for the promotion of
EC.
With the application of the SBA model we can not only ascertain the GHG emissions
of activities involved in the management of the ELT, but we can also assign them to the
GHG emissions of each product obtained in each of the phases of waste management
(Figure 5). This information can be useful to know the life cycle of products manufactured
from recycled materials or to establish comparisons between products manufactured from
natural resources.

5. Results and Discussion 
According to the results of Section 4, afte r applying the SBA model to SIGNUS (Table 
3), it is possible to determine that 3.67% of  GHG emissions are linked to reuse processes, 
a high percentage, 95.82 %, to those of recyclin g, of which 53.26% is to obtain materials to 
reintroduce them into the system and 42.56% is to produce energy. The total 
environmental impact measured in terms of CF is 13,066.85 t CO 2e, an impact derived from 
the additional activities incorporated into the tire production system for the promotion of 
EC. 
With the application of the SBA model we can not only ascertain the GHG emissions 
of activities involved in the management of the ELT, but we can also assign them to the 
GHG emissions of each product obtained in each of the phases of waste management 
(Figure 5). This information can be useful to know the life cycle of products manufactured 
from recycled materials or to establish co mparisons between products manufactured from 
natural resources.

It also allows us to compare the carbon footprint of different processes. According to 
data from the Department for Business, En ergy and Industrial Strategy of the UK 
Government Conversion Factor for Company Reporting (2020), tire manufacturing has a 
carbon footprint of 3.34 tCO 2e per tonne of tire manufactured. This is much higher than 
the carbon footprint of recycled tires, which amounts to 0.04 tCO 2e [73]. 
The results obtained are important for the decision-making process for ELT 
managers, which can encourage them to improve the design and production process of 
reused materials and materials from ELT recycling, to reduce their impact and 
contribution to climate change; in short, to  contribute to the CE promoting sustainable 
development and creating sustainable organiza tions. On the other hand, these results can 
be useful for the development of policies with specific objectives in the prevention of
