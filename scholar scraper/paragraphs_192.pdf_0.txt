municipal solid waste management as a foundation in a circular economy the current literature has yet to be fully developedgiven the complexity of the corresponding concept and knowledge traditional bibliometric analysis lacks the ability to screen out important keywords for future directions and the keyword frequencies are described numerically this study applies the entropy weight method to convert the frequencies toweights and performs regional comparisons based on a database hence this study contributes to the literature by providing potential future directions the database includes published articles and indicators are listed the results are used to identify valid indicators for improvement and provide aregional stateoftheart comparison the top indicators for future study are incineration life cycleassessment plastic waste sorting solid waste and sustainability a bibliographic coupling analysis provides a comparison of regions and reveals that africa and north america have less studies than other regions elsevier ltd all rights reserved introduction the principal premises of a circular economy ce have emerged as closed and slowing loops in which closed loops pertain to post consumer waste recycling slowing refers to product value reten tion through maintenance repair and refurbishment and rema nufacturing to produce ef ciency improvements in the ordinary linear economy bocken et al a kirchherr et al a ce emerges when the value of resources materials and products is preserved as long as possible in the economy and the generation of waste serves as a tactic to develop lowcarbon resource ef ciency and competitive sustainability pires and martinho waste management particularly solid waste management swm andmunicipal solid waste management mswm is the foundation for a ce to achieve more waste prevention and better resource man agement by extending and closing the material cycles that account for waste inputoutput to create inventories of economic ows kalmykova et al zeller et al however the relation ships between mswm and ce entities are blurred in the existing literature and these concepts are diffuse since they were proposed by different viewpoints in different elds geissdoerfer et al corresponding ways of theoretical understanding remain unclear because of deliberation regarding mswm and ce concepts anshassi et al blomsma and brennan bocken et al b nevertheless geographic advantages are achieved through supplementary ef cient material cycles and reverse logistics with synergistic proximity to municipal waste sources and potential industrial source involvement van berkel et al for instance zeller et al argued that adequate resource mea sures for effective market supply and demand and the ability to form municipal organizations

regional ce knowledge is needed to foster environmental outcomes and the total resource management chain understanding mswm in a ce at the regional level is necessary to improve practices as previously mentioned mswm in a ce remains limited and qualitative and quantitative approaches and analyses are lacking korhonen et al a pires and martinho zeller et al there are challenges and opportunities for the development of mswm in a ce since mswm is increasingly complex and a ce has problems in practice while a systematic literature examination indicates that the contributions of mswm in a ce remain unrevised and need to be clari ed sys tematic qualitative and quantitative approaches provide an over view of the state of the art of mswm in a ce for future study directions and improvements in practice the objectives of this study are as follows cto describe mswm in a ce and map the eld with proposed indicators from valid data sources cto explore the knowledge gaps in geographical regions based on a proposed hybrid approach quantitative and qualitative approaches are proposed to enhance the outcomes of the systematic review a hybrid method including bibliometric analysis the fuzzy delphi method and the entropy weight method is proposed bibliometric analysis is used to visualize an overview of the bibliometric status and to reveal the indicators of mswm in a ce from the data of all publications in the scopus database and the results are presented as visual informa tion shukla et al the fuzzy delphi method aims to screen out unnecessary indicators based on expert judgments due to the complexity of a ce and the diversity of problems tseng tseng and bui the entropy weight method is applied to transform the indicator frequency data into comparable weights to determine the performance of regions on the indicators and to identify the critical indicators for improvement in this study wang et al tseng this study contributes to identifying important knowledge to assist further studies and the implementation of practices delivering guidelines regarding the directions of future studies by reviewing the bibliometric status of mswm in a ce and identifying the critical indicators that need further examination and addressing the challenges and gaps among geographical regions to provide local viewpoints of mswm in a ce the second section discusses related literature on a ce and mswm the third section more clearly presents the data collection process methodologies and proposed analytical steps the results are revealed in the fourth section the fth section identi es future challenges and discusses regional comparisons of mswm in a ce finally conclusions are drawn in the last section literature review municipal solid waste management mswm is de ned as complex procedures comprising waste collection routes transfer station locations treatment and energy recovery strategies and waste treatment techniques are the core means to achieve objectives including human health and envi ronmental protection economic development and ful llment of social and regulatory requirements dewi et al sharholy et al claimed that ef cient mswm requires support from both authorities and citizens where the latter are individuals with evolving community awareness and societal interest soltani et al presented that mswm is a complex procedure involvingmultiple decisive factors such as environmental effects related economic outlays and bene ts regional features and political and social issues therefore sustainable mswm is necessary for all stages of the system from design scheduling and neutralization to the preservation of environmental quality for future development goals pires et al it is necessary to identify planning and monitoring methods for swm to reduce the generated amount of waste to recycle some waste with high economic value and to dene indicators that support that a suitable direction is important arkan et al for solid waste intervention in a ce lee developed a recycling investment sustainability framework that involves un certain petitions and nonlinear recycling expenses to balance existing manufacturing restrictions production bene ts and recycling investments for a sustainable ce tisserant et al presented waste treatment and waste footprint scales to design and assess policy instruments for a ce murphy and pincetl showed that material ows are rounded up in a ce with mate rials being used repeatedly to optimize consumption with no wasted materials the products are reused repaired or redis tributed within the system at the end of life if they cannot bereused or repaired products can be recycled or recovered from waste and used as inputs replacing the need to exploit natural resources song et al ghisellini et al andricha et al suggested that a ce aims to prevent and eliminate waste by cycling materials or used products within a closedloop scheme to obtain energy and resource effectiveness and pro tability ness and xing proposed that a ce aims to have no remaining in uence on the ecosystem by recovering resource procurement damage while minimizing the waste produced through manufacturing and product life cycles waste reduction through recycling is stressed under the principal points of reducing raw material consumption designing products in an ecodesign manner lengthening product lifetimes through maintenance and repair and recycling and using products and raw materials recovered from waste ows however theoretical developments are not coherent for this concept and do not align with mswm and a ce because zerowaste perceptions are limited as even in closedloop systems resources are consumed and at least some waste is certainly produced blomsma and brennan niero and kalbar in lieu of this discussion the role of mswm in a ce is irreplaceable and important for guaranteeing the precision of this supplementary approach circular economy a ce is a business operationalization concept whose imple mentation for sustainable development has been much debated the concept stems from the earth s limited capability to acclimatize to contamination in reaction to the necessity of economic devel opment and resource consumption along with environmental in uences korhonen et al a jiao and boons indicated that the concept involves the actions of reducing reusing and recycling in the progression of production consumption and cir culation van buren et al proposed creating a triple bottom line with the social environmental and economic dimensions of a cemendoza et al stated that a ce should take full advantage of resource ef ciency including conserving and improving natural wealth by monitoring nite stocks and assessing renewable resource ows optimizing resource utility products processes and materials within technological and biological circularity and promoting ef cient coordination by disclosing and controlling undesirable externalities ness and xing suggested that a ce aims to achieve more value and to reduce material throughput by involving resource utilization and management closedloop ap proaches adaptation strategies and sharing economy modelsfm tsai td bui ml tseng et al journal of cleaner production in contrast waste prevention in a ce includes reuse refurbish ment and remanufacturing of material ows pires and martinho the fundamentals surpass a reuse loop and include rema nufacturing recycling and reprocessing to recover secondary components and return them to the same usage some endoflife products and materials might shift to other processes such as ex ports for reuse in another location change to lower applications downcycling or be discharged from the system in the form of waste korhonen et al a palomar et al the increasing growth in prior studies informs an evidencebased formulation of a ce and its implications for innovation kirchherr et al conceptualized a model from the most frequent depictions of a ce by reviewing de nitions reike et al explored con troversies in a ce through a focus on reviewing the literature and resource value retention options to provide a heuristic that is useful in practice lacson et al revealed uoride networks and a ce as potential models for sustainable development because discard ing of existing waste is reliant on incineration and the problems posed by land lling in a linear economy model worsen environ mental problems the initial uncertainty and con icts regarding a ce remain due to various practical activities identifying ce challenges in a sustainable global network scheme is an urgent problem korhonen et al a a systematic review of mswm in a ce is still lacking in the literature mswm in a ce from regional perspectives geographic advantage is achieved through supplementary ef cient material cycles and reverse logistics adequate resource proximity measures for market supply and demand effectiveness and the shaping capability of municipal planning and regulation frameworks are considered fundamental to a region s unique po sition in a ce system zeller et al for instance the european union is currently leading in policy implementation and endorsing new ambitious procedures to promote a ce with the most modern waste legislation european commission the concept in volves reusable products and recyclable materials such as metals plastics paper and glass and producing goods from organic waste zeller et al performing ce functions to upcycle waste management is pigeonholed by the use of materials labor and capital in each speci c region and its technology andor innovation level omoloso et al in north america including the united states a ce highlights waste reduction reuse and recycling over disposal van ewijk and stegemann japan and china are the key players in asia to of cially present a ce geng et al worked on co reductions for situations of municipal symbiosis in kawasaki japan fang et al indicated carbon footprint and resource savings in chinese national pilot cities more nuanced grading with tinier decision loops such as restructuring refur bishing and repurposing to enable resource value retention over multiple product life cycles has recently been emphasized in a ce reike et al stahel argued that a ce of reused products and recycling materials is ordinary in lessdeveloped regions where the ce begins with an endoflife product that is utilized to yield new con sumption under a gravetocradle assessment thus this approach reduces both the volume of waste generated in the lower value chain and the demand for virgin resources in the upper value chain however diaz claimed that the original causes of low levels of a ce in countries such as those in latin america and the carib bean and africa are weak political motivation a lack of national waste management policy and legislation inadequate budgets to implement a ce and a lack of professional expertise training and education at all levels these causes led to the occurrence of informal reuse recycling and recovery markets and raised variousquestions regarding the ce concept therefore exploring mswm in a ce is expected to improve the economy conserve the environ ment and protect social fairness by offering an alternative model that is cyclical and reformative and that replaces traditional linear processes korhonen et al b millar et al methods this section more clearly presents the data collection process bibliometric analysis fuzzy delphi method entropy weight method and proposed analytical steps proposed analytical steps this study provides a datadriven bibliometric analysis from a literature review identifying indicators for improving further studies and for accurately determining the differences in the status of research on mswm in a ce in different regions the analytical steps followed are as follows the search terms are identi ed and the publication database is ltered using the scopus website bibliographic analysis is then conducted to nd the indicators of mswm in a ce from the database using vosviewer software the fuzzy delphi method is adopted to re ne the essential in dicators experts opinions from a questionnaire are used to assess the proposed indicators the frequencies of the indicators are generated and the entropy weight method is applied to transform the entropy of the in dicators into comparable scales in this study regional com parisons are carried out the critical indicators are identi ed by subtracting the global weight of the fuzzy delphi method from the entropy weight to examine the study gaps the details of the analytical process are described in fig data collection
