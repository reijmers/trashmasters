Choosing one allocation approach of environmental burden over
another can appear arbitrary. However, the compliance of the ap-
proaches with the concepts of industrial ecology can still be discussed
for this case study. Industrial ecology is based on the concept of waste-
as-a-resource. It considers products intended to be produced, and sec-
ondary resources, which are unintended but can contribute to obtain
new products and depend on the intended products to be produced. On
the other hand, the unintended secondary resources should be safely
managed as a consequence of the production of the intended products.
The concept of industrial ecology highlights a “hierarchy of intent”
(intended products and secondary resources), and a dependence of all
products from the system to one another. First, some allocation ap-
proaches do not allocate any impact of virgin raw materials extraction
and processing to the recovered products (the zero-burden, 0:100,
100:0 and 50:50 approaches). This does not reflect the dependence of
the recovered products to the intended products as they could not be
produced without extraction and processing. On the other hand, the
100:0 approach fully allocates the impact of this processing to the re-
covered products while these processes are a consequence of the pro-
duction of consumer goods. Therefore, based on the concept of the
producer’s responsibility often used to promote the implementation of
the industrial ecology principles, part of the burden from recovery
processes should be allocated to the consumer goods. The “50:50
adapted” approach allocates equally the impact from the raw materials
