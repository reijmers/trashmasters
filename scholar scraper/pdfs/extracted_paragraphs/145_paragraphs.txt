Measuring progress of the new policy requires datasets, metrics and indicators that monitor theperformance of the economy regarding the scale of primary materials use, waste ﬂows, and recycling and cir- cularity. We employ material ﬂow analysis, including measures for inputs and outputs, to assess progress of the circular economy in China over time. We ﬁnd that circularity increased from 2.7% to 5.8% between 1995 and 2015, from an input socioeconomic cycling rate perspective. End of life waste recycling improved from 7.2% to17% over the same time frame and occurred against the backdrop of a strong physical growth dynamic during this whole period. We present a set of policy indicators and situate them in the context of the Chinese indicator sets for a Green Development Indicator System, the Ecological Civilization Construction Assessment TargetSystem and the Sustainable Development Goals. Moving from an economy based on infrastructure and capital investment production for the world market, to a consumption-based economy, may increase the potential for circular economy in China in the future. The policy indicators can also be used to set targets and create ambitionfor a swift transition to closed loop urban and industrial systems in China. 1. Introduction With global primary materials use soaring and China requiring an ever-growing share of the global natural resource base, issues of supply security of primary materials and the associated environmental impacts of rising material demand have received increasing attention from the Chinese policy community. The sheer scale of Chinese primary mate- rials use of 35 billion tons in 2015  of a total of 90 billion tons of global materials consumption ( Schandl et al., 2020; UNEP, 2019) has raised important issues around how to secure the required demand  and how to mitigate the en- vironmental impacts of climate change ( Chen et al., 2020; Hertwich et al., 2019; UNEP-IRP, 2020 ;Yue et al., 2015), biodiversity loss , resource depletion ( Wang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019 ) and pollution ( Chen et al., 2019; Qi et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2017) across the supply chain of natural resources.The options discussed for reducing material use and improving re- source e ﬃciency in China include investment in new technologies and changes in consumption behavior of households and governments, as well as improvements in the built environment ( Jiang et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018 ;Wang et al., 2014 ;Xu et al., 2008 ). These objectives are addressed in the subsequent economic and reform plans of the Chinese government , the Circular Economy Promotion Law  and the broad intent to transition China to an ecological civilization by enabling social and economic outcomes to occur within planetary boundaries ( Steﬀen et al., 2015 ). The new policy objectives of economic resilience, resource ef- ﬁciency and environmental sustainability deal with complex issues and require agreement on how to best approach the objectives and ensureeﬀective and e ﬃcient outcomes from public policy initiatives. To this end, the knowledge base for evidence-based policy needs be improved,especially with regard to creating a good understanding of the main characteristics of the physical economy of China, to measure the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105070 Received 17 March 2020; Received in revised form 30 June 2020; Accepted 25 July 2020⁎Corresponding author at: State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Eco-Industry, Northeastern University, No. 11, Lane 3, Wen Hua Road, He Ping District, Shenyang, Liaoning 110819, China.

T current rate of circularity, i.e. the amount of secondary materials that re-enter the economic process, and to set ambitious policy targets for improving circularity in the future. Such improvements may result from either a better recycling rate for end of life waste or a more fundamental restructuring of the Chinese economy, resulting in a reduction of the overall amount of materials that are processed on a yearly basis. In short, this is what is aspired to by the circular economy , which is based on redesigning major provision systems including housing, mobility, food, energy and water, in addition to improvements in major consumer good sectors for long- lived goods. The new information required for advancing circular economy policy is provided through comprehensive material ﬂow accounts  which are complementary to economic accounts but report volumes of materials introduced to an economy , the production of goods (for export and domestic markets) and resulting waste and emissions. Var- ious previous studies have established accounts for material use in China , but a standard set of material ﬂow accounting indicators with a focus on circularity and comparable to other countries is still needed. The accounting framework used in this study is based on internationally agreed methodological standards  and has been applied for the period 1995 –2015. Generating the results bene ﬁts from previous studies of economic circularity ( Haas et al., 2015 ;Jacobi et al., 2018 ;Mayer et al., 2018 ) but has required substantial and systematic reworking of the research strategy to accommodate the data char- acteristics and data availability of China. As a result, we report a standard set of material ﬂow accounting indicators with a focus on the output side and measure the circularity of the economy based on amaterial balance of the Chinese economy. We complement the analysis with resource e ﬃciency indicators and link the metrics used in this study to the data needs of newly established Chinese indicator sets and the Sustainable Development Goals. 2. Methods and data In this study, we developed a monitoring framework for China's CE at the macro level, based on the Chinese statistical system and previous research that linked EW-MFA with secondary material ﬂows to allow for monitoring CE in national economies ( Haas et al., 2015; Jacobi et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2018 ). Due to the large number and variety of material and waste ﬂows involved in the framework (up to 155 categories of ﬂows, see SI), the amount of data is very large. For the sake of understanding, we code each material ﬂow, and then introduce them in the CE model , monitoring indicators  and data sources , respectively. 2.1. Basic model and indicators for monitoring China's circular economy The basic monitoring framework for comprehensive material ﬂow accounts of the Chinese economy is shown in Fig. 1 and enables us to trace 14 main material and waste ﬂow categories  including the extraction of primary materials and imports, the transformation of materials within the production system, and outputs of commodities for export and disposal of emissions and waste. Boxes represent the main stages of material ﬂows across the entire socioeconomic system: 1) the origin of material inputs , 2) the transformation and processing stages [M5. Processed materials , M6. Energetic use , M7. Material use ,M11. Solid and liquid wastes from energetic use, M12. End of life  wastes, and Societal in-use stocks], and 3) the destination of out ﬂows . The ﬂows of material and waste between these boxes are displayed as arrows . We employ this framework, which is based on previous studies andguidelines ( Eurostat, 2013 ;Haas et al., 2015 ;Jacobi et al., 2018; Krausmann et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2018 ;Wang et al., 2019 ), to construct a new dataset for China covering two decades from 1995 to2015. Many of the indicators displayed in Table 1 have become stan- dard indicators that are calculated from material ﬂow accounts and have been agreed by the research and statistical community . To enable the analysis of circularity, a new category of secondary ma-terials  is introduced, which refers to the recovery of materials through all forms of recycling, reuse and remanufacturing and also includes downcycling and cascading . Secondary materials include recycled materials from End of Life  wastes andindustrial solid wastes. By adding DMC and SM we establish the amount of materials that are processed , which is the apparent domestic consumption of materials with secondary ﬂows included. Processed materials  are distinguished between Energetic use  andMaterial use , which has consequences for their further use pathways. Energetic use comprises fossil fuels and biomass for energy production. Not all fossil fuels are used for energy and a small fraction is used as a feedstock material . The eUse of biomass mainly refers to fuel wood and the biomass used to generate metabolic energy for humans and livestock. Employing the principle of conservation of mass, net additions to stock  are calculated by gross additions to in-use stocks  minus demolition and discard, where GAS equals mUse minus throughput materials. The amount of throughput materials can be as- certained directly from the Chinese statistical system. On the output side, except for DPO (including DPO emissions and DPO wastes), two additional indicators are introduced: EoL wastes and Interim Outputs . The former is equal to the sum of throughput materials, demolition and discard, and solid and liquid wastes from energetic use, and the latter equals EoL waste plus DPO emissions. It is notable that, in contrast to previous studies, we did not consider ex-tractive wastes separately, but included them in DPO wastes, because in China these data are included in industrial solid wastes and they can be reused as SM , rather than emitted directly to the environment. Input socioeconomic cycling rate  and Output socioeconomic cycling rate  are the main in- dicators for monitoring the recycling of materials from the perspectives of the input side and output side, respectively. The ISCr is relatively signiﬁcantly a ﬀected by changes in PM, while the OSCr is less a ﬀected since waste quantities are not dynamically coupled with EW-MFA inputdata as a result of e ﬀects from stock dynamics . 2.2. Data The data sources and accounting methods for each basic material and waste ﬂow are summarized in Table S1 in the SI, and more detailed explanations of the 155 categories of ﬂows are provided in the SI using the year 2010 as a representative example . To complete theaccounting for all material ﬂows, we constructed six sub-accounts fo- cusing on waste ﬂows, which are also shown in the SI: A1 Industrial solid waste reused, A2 Industrial solid waste emitted, A3 Household waste, A4 Construction waste, A5 Food balance, and A6 Human and animal metabolism. For category A1 Industrial solid waste reused and category A2 Industrial solid waste emitted, we allocated China's industrial solid waste  from the original data from the China Environmental Statistics Yearbooks ( National Bureau of Statistics: Ministry of Ecology and Environment, 1996 –2016 ) and the proportions of di ﬀerent material categories (biomass, metal ores and metals, non-metallic minerals, fossil fuels, material use, and energetic use) were established using the classi ﬁcation from . For category A3 Household waste, we allocated China's householdwaste data available from the China Statistical YearbooksH. Wang, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 163  105070 2  and the proportions of diﬀerent material categories follow the principles from ( Mayer et al., 2018 ). For category A4 Construction waste data is very limited. 1.8 billion tons of construction demolition waste are reported in statistical sourcesfor 2016 . We mainly refer to , who analysed the generation and ﬂows of construction and demolition waste in China during 2003 –2013 and data for all other years is established through linear regression. It is notable that based on , the generation of China's construction waste would be 4.85 billion tons, Fig. 1.. Basic monitoring model of China's Circular Economy. Adapted from .

To be consistent with the oﬃcial data, we divided the construction waste generation data from  by this coe ﬃcient of 2.69 for the whole dataset. This may underestimate the amount of construction waste generated in China to a certain extent. The split of category M5 processed materials into energetic and material use was established based on material characteristics and ad- ditional information from food balances  and energy bal- ances. The solid and liquid wastes of people and livestock were esti-mated by the daily manure production coe ﬃcients shown in A6 in the SI. 3. Results Applying the CE monitoring framework to China for the period of 1995 –2015, we can generate a comprehensive material ﬂow balance, disaggregated ﬂow balances for four material groups , and additional basic monitoring indicators . The following paragraphs provide analysis of the full picture of China's material ﬂows and the circularity of four major material groups. 3.1. Material ﬂows of China's economy During the period 1995 to 2015 the amount of materials processed  in the Chinese economy increased by a factor of 3.1, from 12billion tons to 37.5 billion tons, an average annual growth rate of 5.9% . In 1995, 97.2% of PM  was extracted domestically , 2.7% of PM  comprisedsecondary materials  and only 0.1% of PM  was net physical imports  . Compared to 1995, the proportion of DE somewhat declined to 94.1%  in 2005 and 89.9%  in 2015  and net Fig. 2.. The state of China's Circular Economy in 1995 . Unit: Billion tons. Fig. 3.. The state of China's Circular Economy in 2015 . Unit: Billion tons.H. Wang, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 163  105070 4 imports and secondary materials gained in importance. Overall, during the two decades, China continued to rely heavily on domestic natural resources. The share of material use of all processed materials grew over time from a share of 70.5%  in 1995 , to 74.7% (15.1 billion tons) in 2005, and 79.1%  in 2015 ; only 29.5%  in 1995, 25.3%  in2005, and 20.9%  in 2015 were used for energy generation. Most of the material use has been required for building up re- sidential, commercial and industrial infrastructure and transport and communication networks and was added to stocks . In 1995, the GAS was 8.3 billion tons, and with the rapid urbanization process, it increased to 29.2 billion tons in 2015, increasing by a factor of 3.5. During these two decades, the accumulated stock reached as high as 320 billion tons, which provides the physical basis of China's improving infrastructure. Simultaneously, very large amounts of construction de- molition waste, industrial solid waste and residential waste were dis- posed of with only a small amount re-entering the economic process as secondary materials through recycling. For example, in 2015 EoL waste was 5.3 billion tons, out of which only 2.2 billion tons were recycled. The remaining part was land ﬁlled or incinerated and disposed to theenvironment. With increasing energy and biomass consumption, China's DPO of emissions increased from 3.2 billion tons in 1995 to 7.5 billion tons in 2015, with an annual increasing rate of 4.3%, adding signiﬁcantly to global GHG emissions and making China one of the largest polluters globally. While material use, waste ﬂows and emissions accelerated, China's circularity rates also increased signi ﬁcantly. The input socioeconomic cycling rate  increased from 2.7% to 5.8% andthe output socioeconomic cycling rate  in- creased from 7.2% to 17.0%. It is obvious that ISCr is much lower than OSCr, because a large share of China's processed materials  were added to stock and the interim outputs (IntOut = EoL waste + DPO emissions) were much lower than PM. Compared to the European Union , whose ISCr was 9.6% in 2014 , China's ISCr is signi ﬁcantly lower, mainly because of the lack of a sound re- cycling system and the large amount of GAS. On the contrary, China's OSCr is relatively higher than that of the EU, whose OSCr was 14.8% in 2014, because most of China's SM is from industrial solid waste and the central government has imposed mandatory targets (utilization e ﬃ- ciency of general industrial solid waste) for local governments andenterprises in recent years, contributing to higher rates of end of life recycling.

Circularity of four major material groups Figs. 4– 7show the disaggregated ﬂows for the four major material groups –biomass, fossil fuels, metal ore and non-metallic minerals –in China's economy between 1995 and 2015. During the two decades, biomass extraction increased from 2.5 billion tons to 3.6 billion tons, and recycled biomass (mainly from waste paper, waste wood and re- sidues) increased from 68 million tons to 314 million tons, increasing the ISCr of biomass from 2.6% to 7.5% and the OSCr from 3.0% to 8.3% . The biological cycles have very large potential for full circu- larity, which is far from being achieved in China. Metal extraction also increased rapidly from 0.4 billion tons to 1.8 billion tons during 1995 –2015, and in 2015 imported metal ores were as high as 1.2 billion tons. The high economic value and criticality of supply contributed result in a signi ﬁcant amount of secondary ma- terials and higher recovery rates. Speci ﬁcally, the SM amount (in- cluding re ﬁning waste) increased from 109 million tons to 806 million tons, resulting in comparatively high ISCr of 19.7% in 1995 and 22.7% in 2015 and OSCr of 35.4% in 1995 and 49.9% in 2015. This also re- ﬂects that metal recycling is economically viable and developed mar- kets exist for secondary materials. The main reason for making metalrecycling economically attractive is the very high energy costs of pri- mary metal extraction. Among the four groups, non-metallic minerals dominate material ﬂows by volume, e.g., 67% of PM came from non-metallic minerals in 2015 . Moreover, due to its low economic value, nearly all of China's PM of non-metallic minerals is sourced from DE, and therecycling rate is not as high as for metals, despite the potential for reuseof construction demolition waste in road base. Nevertheless, the re- cycled amount and recycling rate of non-metallic minerals has been continuously increasing. Recycled non-metallic minerals grew by a factor of 7.4, from 126 million tons to 938 million tons, their ISCr in- creased from 1.7% to 3.5% and their OSCr grew from 29.1% to 36.0%. Even though the recycling rate has been increasing signi ﬁcantly, there is still a large amount of waste from non-metallic minerals released tothe environment due to the huge amount of consumption. As only minor shares of fossil fuels went to stocks in the form of plastics and bitumen, the recycled amount and recycling rate of fossil fuels are the lowest among the four material groups . In 1995, its SM amount was only around 20 million tons and the ISCr and OSCrwere 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively. Twenty years later, the SM amount of fossil fuels had increased to 110 million tons, meaning the ISCr and OSCr for both had increased to 2.3%. Increasing circularity in the en- ergy sector will require a shift to renewable energy generation and away from burning fossil fuels. Such a transition would result in someincrease in metals and would help combat climate change signi ﬁcantly. 4. Discussion This study provides a framework for measuring the progress of China's Circular Economy, which is not only directly linked to China's Circular Economy policies, but also linked to the Sustainable Development Goals , Chinese indicator sets for the 13th Five Year Plan , the Green Development Indicator System, and Fig. 5..

Resources, Conservation & Recycling 163  105070 6 the Ecological Civilization Construction Assessment Target System. Based on the ﬁndings above and these linkages, policy implications are provided for the Circular Economy and sustainable development ofChina. 4.1. Discussion on ﬁndings and policy implications The physical scale of the Chinese economy, i.e. processed materials  per capita, increased by a factor of 2.7 from 9.9 t/cap in 1995 to 27.3 t/cap in 2015. As a consequence of this rapid growth per capita, PM in China is now higher than in the EU-28  and in Austria , for which similar analysis is available ( Jacobi et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2018 ). 80% of processed materials were used in biological and technical supply chains and only 20% used in energy provision, which also contributes to a higher level of Gross additions to stock  for China compared to the European Union and is explained by China's massive infrastructure build up. During 1995 –2015, around 320 billion tons of materials were ac- cumulated as stock of buildings and infrastructure, including residential and commercial buildings, industrial infrastructure, and transport and communication networks. While material use has grown, the growth rate has decelerated, foreshadowing that China's resource consumption may peak in the near future. As a result, it has been suggested that thefocus of China's sustainable resource use policy should gradually shift from consumption reduction to sustainable management of stocks , for example, through increasing the lifetime of infrastructure and using recyclablemodular buildings . At the same time, a large amount of long-lived consumer goodsaccumulated during the studied period and China will gradually enterthe scrap stage and generate huge amounts of secondary materials, such as scrap steel , copper , aluminum ( Chen and Shi, 2012 ;Li et al., 2020 ;Yue et al., 2014), and electronic waste . Ef- fectively recycling of end of life waste will depend on improved wastemanagement and recycling infrastructure and will determine the extent to which China can reduce primary  material demand in the future. In the past 20 years, China has made great progress in the com- prehensive utilization of industrial solid waste, which is the main reason why China's end-resource recycling rate has reached EU level. After entering the scrap stage, another transition in waste management and recycling capability for comprehensive treatment of end of life consumer waste will be required. In addition to focusing on these two shifts in China's future, a comprehensive indicator system that allows reporting of primary ma- terial demand in the economy, greenhouse gas emissions and waste disposal in one coherent analytical framework is also needed for policy development. Focusing on end of life waste recycling, reducing waste to landﬁll and improving resource e ﬃciency to address waste issues at the source are all worthwhile short-term policy principles that are no-regretstrategies. While resource e ﬃciency reduces cost and is economically attractive , climate mitigation has a short- term cost. Waste recycling is economically worthwhile for metals, butthis is not generalizable for all materials. In the medium term , 10 to 20 years, the economy requires structural adjustments to help reduce waste ﬂows through designing new materials, products and processes that service the needs of the Fig. 6..

Resources, Conservation & Recycling 163  105070 7 population but require considerably fewer materials and result in sig- niﬁcantly less waste and lower emissions. Changes in supply chains that allow for redesign of production and consumption promise much largereconomic bene ﬁt, compared to short-term changes of reduce, reuse and recycle. They may generate the economic and employment opportu-nities of the future enabled through the bio, digital and circular economies. In the long run, urban and industrial systems must be established asclosed loop systems in order to allow wellbeing and living standards for large numbers of people and within planetary boundaries. Generalizing high living standards for 9 billion people needs lots of additional nat- ural resources and will add additional pressure on material supply systems and will continue to overshoot planetary boundaries. Closing the loop allows to relieve some of this pressure and avoids the need of tapping into those natural resource reserves that have the largest ne- gative social and environmental impacts . Urban industrial symbiosis   promises a restructuring of the way in which cities and industries are operated as closed loop systems. 4.2. Linking circular economy indicators to key policies China has been making progress in the promotion of circular economy  for decades and has published around 280 CE or resource use related laws, policies and regulations . To monitor and evaluate the e ﬀectiveness of the Circular Economy Promotion Law, new CE metrics and indicators have been proposed for the macro economy and for industrial parks ( Geng et al., 2012 ;McDowall et al., 2017 ). Most circularity indicators focus on speci ﬁc materials or waste ﬂows, such as the recycling rate of iron scrap, non-ferrous metals, waste Fig. 7..

Three-phase circular economy policy.H. Wang, et al. Resources, Conservation & Recycling 163  105070 8 paper, plastics, rubber, and industrial solid waste, and there is a lack of indicators and clear targets for general whole of economy recycling rates on both the input and output sides. Moreover, because of the lack of a detailed and standardized accounting process, signi ﬁcant barriers to the implementation of the new indicators exist. Therefore, this study can be regarded as an important reference for establishing indicators of circularity for the whole economy. In order to realize the full potential of CE, it is important to link CE indicators to existing key policy priorities and decision processes. We present a set of CE indicators and situate these in the context of the SDGs, the Chinese indicator sets for the 13th Five Year Plan  ( Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, 2016 ), the Ecological Civilization Construction Assessment Target System , and the Green Development Indicator System . At the global level, several indicators provided by this study can be directly or indirectly linked to the SDGs . For example, there are three SDGs for which MFA based indicators have been selected to monitorprogress by the Inter Agency Expert Group, namely SDG 8.4, SDG 12.2 and SGD 12.5. For SDGs 8.4 and 12.5 the standard indicators of Do- mestic Material Consumption and Material Footprint are used to cal- culate resource productivity  and per-capita material use . Reporting on the output side and for circularity allows to inform SDG 12.5 in triremes of recycling rate and total end-of life waste and waste to land ﬁll. However, only half of them can be related to the key national po- licies of China, most of which are focused on the utilization of industrial solid waste, energy consumption, emissions reduction and intensity indicators. This study can contribute to measuring these indicators. For instance, resource productivity is an important indicator in China'sGreen Development Indicator System, but it still lacks a stan- dardized accounting method in China. Regarding general national cir- cularity indicators, Japan and the EU countries have already set this indicator as one of the main monitoring indicators for CE , and this research provides a timely and necessary reference both on perspectives ofindicator selection and a standardized accounting process. 4.3. Research limitations There are several limitations to our approach to accounting for China's CE indicators that we would like to acknowledge. The whole CE framework includes the following basic material ﬂows: input ﬂows, output ﬂows, secondary materials and stocks, and the generally pro- blematic data are from the latter three ﬂows. Regarding input ﬂows, we divided the processed materials of biomass and fossil fuels into en-ergetic use and material use materials, but we can only ﬁnd the pro- portion for biomass, and wechose to use the proportion of energetic usefor fossil fuels from . Regarding output ﬂows, even though the Chinese National Statistical O ﬃce publishes annual data on industry solid waste and household waste, there is no distinction be-tween the four types of material groups. Therefore, we adopted the proportion coe ﬃcients of these four material groups for EU countries from . As Chinese economic structure and waste treatment levels are di ﬀerent from EU countries, this coe ﬃcient transplant could cause a degree of uncertainty and the ﬁnal  indicators may be sensitive to this. As for SM, although the development of CE in China started earlier, the statistics for SM data are relatively recent and most of them are from uno ﬃcial sources. Thus, in this study the SM of several materials  wasderived from di ﬀerent literature. In addition, for a few years between 1995 and 2000 there was no data available for several recycled mate-rials, which we used the linear interpolation method to estimate. Stock data is another important issue ( Fishman et al., 2016; Krausmann et al., 2017 ;Miatto et al., 2017), which relates to the other three main ma- terial ﬂows. However, there is little o ﬃcial data on Chinese stocks  and related construction waste, including recycled and disposal waste. In this study we estimated these data based on the limited o ﬃcial data and a relevant study  (see A4 in the SI). Overall, the above limitations call for a comprehensive and fastimprovement in the Chinese statistical system for CE. 5. Conclusion This study has provided a framework for measuring the progress of China's Circular Economy, including a CE model, datasets, metrics and indicators monitoring the performance of the economy regarding the scale of primary materials use, waste ﬂows, and recycling and circu- larity. Using this framework, the Chinese CE situation during1995 –2015 has been examined. The results indicate that during the study period, on the input side China's Processed Materials  increased by a factor of 3.1 from 12.0 billion tons to 37.5 billion tons, which is dominated by DE of non-metallic minerals. On the output side, China's Interim Outputs  increased by a factor of 2.8 from 4.5 billion tons to 12.8 billion tons. The di ﬀerence between Processed Materials and Interim Outputs con- tributed more than 320 billion tons of Net Additions to Stock. Apartfrom the input side and output side material ﬂow indicators, China's circularity rates also increased dramatically. The Input SocioeconomicCycling Rate  increased from 2.7% to 5.8%, whereas the Output Socioeconomic Cycling Rate (OSCr, SM share of IntOut) rose from 7.2% to 17.0%. Based on the framework of Chinese CE provided, we linked CE in- dicators to the Sustainable Development Goals , Chinese in-dicator sets for the 13th Five Year Plan , the Green Development Indicator System, and the Ecological CivilizationConstruction Assessment Target System. We ﬁnd that this study can supplement these indicators. Last but not least, three-phase  policy suggestions have been provided for the Circular Economy and sustainable development of China.Table 2 Basic monitoring indicators of China's Circular Economy during 1995 –2015.
