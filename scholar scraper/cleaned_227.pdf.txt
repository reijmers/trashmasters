associated with managing waste in the horticultural sector by presenting the circulareconomy framework as a solution to the problem of food waste The research focuses on consumers role and value adding as one strategy that transforms food waste for reuse in accordance with a circular economy A structured questionnaire was collected from a sample n of Australian households to assess consumers willingness buy food derived from underutilised biomass Thesurvey found half of the sample was willing to buy valueadded food Helping Australian farmers was the topranking factordriving demand Awareness of the food waste problem is signi cant in distinguishing consumers who are willing to buy valueadded food from those who are not Marketingrecommendations for communication design a circular economy are to stress empathy and care for farmers and highlight theconsequences of food waste for both the natural environment and peopleKEYWORDS Consumer attitudes circular economy food waste

problem World Resources Institute Since the Industrial Revolution economies have followed a model of take makeusedispose which is called the linear economy Andrews The linear economy results in products becoming waste at the end of their life Figure Many scho lars Andrews Lewandowski Murray Skene Haynes have discussed the linear economy s lack of sustainability and propose alternative

economy involves reuse repair refurbishing and recycling of existing materials and products and what was earlier considered to be wastebecomes a resource Jurgilevich et al In this research we focus on one circular economy approach namely valueadding to deal with the food waste problem in the Australian horticulture industry In Australia the horticulture industry is grappling with the food waste

Valueadding involves turning fruit and vegetable residues into high value products Lin et al and is one example of the reuse of materials that illustrates circular economy principles Murray et al In food markets consumers are the nal users Hence it is imperative to understand to what extent a circular economy solution to the food waste issue ie novel valueadded food made from food waste is appealing to food consumers Studies on the consumer s perspective of a circular economy are lacking Chamberlin Boks with scholars stating little is known about consumers willingness to participate in a circular economy Borrello Caracciolo Lombardi Pascucci Cembalo p In the area of valueadded food derived from food waste most existing research is located in the food science discipline and describes restricted examples and pilotscale laboratory experiences Mirabella Castellani Sala With regard to the consumer s perspec tive scholars note consumers are averse to novel foodrelated technologies for manyreasons including risk aversion and perceptions of unnaturalness Lusk Roosen Bie berstein Branded products derived from food waste are limited and commerciali sation ie the process of taking patented products and processes to the market ischallenging Galanakis The present article by focusing on Australian consumers attitudes towards novel valueadded products aims to ll a gap in the literature and also has practical implications for growers and other value chain membersRURAL SOCIETY Literature review theory Fruit and vegetables are the second largest commodity contributing to food loss around the world Food is lost during or immediately after harvesting on the farm for several reasons These include fruit that is bruised eaten by pests does not meet the rigid quality standards set by retailers or is dumped due to oversupply in the marketplaceLipinski et al The two major sources of surplus food and food waste at the farm are overproduction and noncompliance with market standards in terms of sizeshape or appearance Garrone Melacini Perego In Australia the power of supermarkets to enforce quality standards is a source of frustration for farmers Richards Lawrence Loong Burch It is estimated that of all vegetables pro duced in Australia do not leave the farm and the total cost of agricultural food loss tofarmers is billion Australian Government The scale of this loss makes waste reduction at the preand postharvest stages an important policy goal as outlined in the Food Waste Strategy The vision of a circular economy is gaining traction in academic and practitioner oriented literatures There is however no commonly accepted de nition of a circular economy Yuan Bi Moriguichi and scholars have identi ed de nitions Kirchherr Reike Hekkert The concept of a circular economy in general terms promotes resource minimisation Anderson and is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce reuse and recycle activities EU Commission K i r c h h e r re ta l M a r t i nS c h o u t e n W o niak Pactwa which help turn a linear system into a circular system In a linear economic model the physical environment is treated as a receptacle for waste products from the economy and design for disassembly recycling and reuse are not fundamental partsof the system This is ine cient since resources ie materials energy water etc ow out of the system A circular economy on the other hand is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design It is founded on the principleof the earth as a closed economic system where the environment and economy arelinked in a circular relationship The circular nature refers to materials owing within a closedloop which are to be reused again and again Jackson Lederwasch Giurco Scholars in the circular economy eld often draw upon the waste hierarchy fra mework reduce reuse recycle recovery land ll and it is agreed that the most impor tant step in the approach to waste management is waste prevention PapargyropoulouLozano Steinberger Wright bin Ujang This research adopts the following denition of a circular economy A circular economy describes an economic system that is based on business models which replace the endoflife concept with reducing alternatively reusing recycling and recovering materials in productiondistribution and consumption processes thus operating at the microlevel products companies consumers meso level ecoindustrial parks and macro levelcity region nation and beyond with the aim to accomplish sustainable developmentwhich implies creating environmental quality economic prosperity and social equity tothe bene t of current and future generations Kirchherr et al p Figure oers examples of how a linear horticultural sector can be turned into a circular system and outlines key strategies For instance commodities such as fruit and vegetables are grown consumed composted and returned to the earth to enrich the soil B MCCARTHY ET ALCommodities can also be used to make processed food and the materials ie packaging or waste ie products such as oils peels and seeds can be recycled and returned to the producer or processor and used as inputs in the food industry or another industry Currently Australian horticulture is struggling with food loss and food waste In general the term food loss refers to food lost in the primary production and processing stages of the value chain and food waste refers to food lost at the retailer catering andhousehold levels Cristbal Castellani Manfredi Sala The use of food waste should follow waste hierarchy principles with waste prevention Papargyropoulou et al such as consumer education campaigns and donations to charity being the pre ferred options Evaluating the relative merits of waste management alternatives however is a complex task GarciaGarcia et al Life cycle analysis shows that some actions such as consumer education campaigns cold chain management shouldalways be prioritised since they avoid a high environmental impact at a low cost Cristbalet al Food that is edible but deemed of lower quality in terms of aesthetics can be sold through local farmers markets and there is a rich literature on the bene ts of alterna tive food networks to society Turner Hope Despite rigid food product standards in mainstream channels one major Australian retailer Woolworths sells some freshproduce at a discount price under the Odd Bunch campaign CalvoPorral Medn LosadaLpez Food waste can be lightly processed such as chopped and packaged salads or mixed vegetables or undergo traditional food processing techniques ie canneddried or frozen These strategies have limitations however since the horticultural sector must compete directly with both processed and fresh imports from countries with very low labour rates which is a challenge in Australia Queensland Government nd Value adding in commodity value chains is increasingly being adopted by growers in reaction to globalisation pressures Rodrguez Cohard Snchez Martnez GallegoSimn Excess produce can be converted into highly processed products such as baby food juices jams fermented foods pickles sauces soups and so forth In Australiathere is growing interest in waste valorisation practices based on innovative plantbased products For example Natural Evolution Foods is a company that transforms organically grown green bananas into glutenfree banana our and starchresistant dietary bre Aus tralian Government It is possible to convert food waste into energy although it is not the most sustainable or coste ective option for dealing with food waste Problems relate to the capacity of treatment infrastructure and di culty in separating food waste from other waste streams Kibler Reinhart Hawkins Motlagh Wright Sundrop Farms in South Australia is an example of an innovative circular food producer that grows toma toes in greenhouses by using solar power electricity generation fresh water production andhydroponics Sundrop Farms nd Another solution to the food waste problem is to divert it to animal feed Food waste can be turned into compost which helps close the loop in a circular economy Borrello et al and products such as a liquid to enrich soil health oer an Australian manufacturing example BioRegen nd Valueadding refers to the process of increasing the value of inputs through transform ation for instance by using manufacturing processes or di erentiated production tech niques such as organic production CSIRO For instance citrus peel can be used as a natural sweetener ie sugar syrup in processed foods and pectin can be utilisedas a gelling agent by the confectionary sector In recent times there has been a move towards redesign of commodity products by extracting nutrients from biomass TheRURAL SOCIETY shift towards converting food waste into highvalue products is driven by several factors These include advanced technologies consumer interest in health and the sophisticated marketing of functional foods and neutraceuticals by cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries Ernst Nutraceutical is a term derived from the words nutrition and pharmaceutical and can refer to any substance that is a food or a part of a food and provides medical or health bene ts including the prevention and treatment of diseases DeFelice Examples include sh oils or olive leaf extract Likewise functional foods refer to foods that may provide health bene ts beyond basic nutrition such as pro biotic drinking yogurt Siro Kapolna Kapolna Lugasi Food waste is a source of valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries For instancebromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple juice and in the stem of the pineapple and can be used to treat medical ailments Galanakis Laufenberg Kunz Nystroem Lin et al Mirabella et al The fresh cut fruit industry discards large percentages of byproducts such as peels seeds and unused esh that can present similar or even higher contents of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds carotenoids and vitamins than the nal product Mirabella et al Options for waste management in the Australian horticultural sector are a mix of linear and circular economies Many challenges to reducing food loss exist including the current nature of food production with its inherent risks such as perishability bad weather disease and declined market price as well as deeply embedded social habits and institutional practices Canali et al Australian growers speci cally cite barriers in the form of added expenses and lack of time knowledge andor markets to sell valueadded products Duarte Alonso Northcote This research focuses on one strategy presented in Figure rethinking reprocessing redesign using parts or all of a dis carded product in a new improved product A study by the Commonwealth Scienti c and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO shows valuable food ingredients andsnack products can be produced using vegetables which are dried and ground to apowder with minimal loss of nutrients CSIRO a Extrusion ie mixing cooking shearing pu ng shaping and drying is a process designed to produce a wide variety of foods in sectors such as snacks readytoeat RTE cereals biscuits confectionery and extruded crisp breads Presently however the technology is restricted to two types of biomass whole carrots and broccoli CSIRO b Market reports also high light the trend towards health and wellness along with convenience in the food and bev erages industry with companies using di erent strategies to address such trends that include more plantbased ingredients in high growth sectors ie beverages snackscereals and baked goods and provision of premium priced valueadded food productswith signi cant health claims CSIRO Euromonitor a b Turning fruit and vegetable residues into higher value products allows growers to capture more valuein the supply chain Potential bene ts are increased competitiveness by generating additional pro ts and reducing disposal costs Lin et al better health outcomes an increase in the overall quantity of vegetables eaten by Australians pollution prevention conservation of scarce resources such as energy water labour land and agrochemicals CSIRO and patenting and licensing opportunities Critics of a circular economy argue the social dimension inherent in sustainable devel opment thinking is absent Murray et al and that furthermore the role of consu mers as enablers of a circular economy is not outlined Chamberlin Boks B MCCARTHY ET ALKirchherr et al Chamberlin and Boks recently addressed this limitation by examining how businesses providing circular products or services use communications to market their o erings and in uence consumer behaviour This article focuses on consu mers role in purchasing circular products and moving the horticultural sector towards a circular economy To understand reasons for buying a valueadded product the normactivation model Schwartz Howard is utilised This model posits that awareness of consequences AC is one factor amongst others that in uences pro social or environmental behaviour Speci cally it refers to whether someone is aware of the negative consequences for others or for other things one values when not acting prosocially Steg Vlek Food waste is regarded as a moral problem given the inequality of access to food across the globe AschemannWitzel Jensen Jensen Kuli kovskaja N e Spiker Truant and the rising problem of food security Foley et al Godfray et al There is ample evidence that consumers feel guilty uncomfortable or bothered to some extent if they waste food Brook Lyndhurst Hamilton Denniss Baker Parizeau von Massow Martin Setti Falasconi Segr Cusano Vittuari Stefan van Herpen Tudoran Lhteenmki Watson Meah and several scholars link food waste avoidance to moral jud gements Bortoleto Kurisu Hanaki Gjerris Gaiani Stancu Haugaard Lhteenmki Hence based on the existing research and conceptual model reviewed the following hypothesis is proposed HPeople who are willing to buy value added foods show more awareness of the food waste problem than those who are not willing to buy valueadded foods Methods Research instrument Data was collected using a questionnaire which contained measures of willingness to buy valueadded foods awareness of the food waste problem motives for buying valueadded foods as well as demographic information such as age education gender and income level The concept of valueadded foods was sourced from food scientists after attendingworkshops on food waste organised by the CSIRO The CSIRO team aims to create healthyfood ingredients and products from edible biomass left in the eld lost biomass after harvest or from sidestreams of food processing CSIRO a This represents a circu lar economy approach to reduce food waste ie by reprocessing lost biomass to valueadded food and a move away from a linear economy approach of disposing food waste Three types of valueadded food made from fruit and vegetable waste were ident ied a vegetable powder made from whole carrot that can be used as a healthy ingredient for smoothies dips sauces etc an onthego vegetable snack product made from broccoli and a fermented product based on vegetables that is rich innutrients and bre and can be used in products such as baby food dips and smoothies To understand consumers willingness to buy valueadded food we asked the question Are you willing to buy any one of the following products that can be made from fruitand vegetable waste Consumers then indicated their willingness to buy which was measured for each of the three types of valueadded products using a seven point scaleanchored from extremely unwilling to extremely willing RURAL SOCIETY We measured general awareness of the food waste problem using six items taken from a scale developed by Delley and Brunner Some of these items were previously used by Stefan et al and Gjerris and Gaiani The measure included three components awareness of the social environmental and nancial consequences of food waste Perceived food scarcity and a general awareness of the intrinsic value of food which is linked to the natural environment and an item that measured attribution of responsibility for the food waste problem were included Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement ordisagreement with given statements that also used a seven point scale anchored from very strongly disagree to very strongly agree The six scale items were Food waste is a big environmental issue In my country households are responsible for a great proportion of the food waste Food waste is an important social issue eg world hunger Foods are scarce over the world and should be consumed consciously Foods are gifts of nature and have to be treated as such and In my country the food waste generated by households has great nancial consequences The six item scale had a Cronbach s alpha of M SD con rming the reliability of the scale We also measured perceived consumer e ectiveness in curbing food waste with one item I believe that every little e ort by consumers helps to reduce the food waste problem using a seven point scale Th gersen Lastly consu mers motives for buying valueadded food were assessed by respondents ranking six factors that would in uence their demand for valueadded food The six factors considered consumer demand for health and price but also e ects on humans versus e ects on the environment These items have been used in prior research relating to sustainabilitynotably clean energy Poortinga Pidgeon Lorenzoni Sampling and recruitment Ethics approval was secured from the Human Ethics Committee in the rst author s uni versity H A pretest of the questionnaire was undertaken with the help of students and three marketing scholars highly experienced in consumer behaviour who reviewedthe research instrument The target population were food shoppers who had responsibility for food shopping cooking or waste disposal An online panel provided by Qualtrics Data Service was utilised to recruit respondents given the use of panels is becoming increasinglycommon in food waste studies Birau Faure de Hooge et al Ilyuk Mallinson Russell Barker Stancu et al We employed a quota sampling method to ensure the distribution of gender and age was aligned with the population ofAustralian food shoppers An incentive the chance to win a voucher was used toencourage research participation To reduce social desirability biases van de Mortel an online questionnaire and a guarantee of anonymity were used to counteract inclinations to o ersocially correct answers Data was collected from April to May and a total of usable questionnaires were obtained

uses fruit or vegetable waste as a raw material Helping farmersgrowers to prevent food waste was perceived as more important than all other factors with ranking this in their top two preferences Positive eects on the natural environment and eects on the economy were of secondmost importance while meeting the needs of the priceconscious consumer received the lowest importance across the top two preferences Findings forfactors in uencing the demand for valueadded foods were obtained by comparing those willing and unwilling to buy a valueadded snack food product Willingness to buywas recoded into two groups willing score of or and unwilling or neutral score of or Results appear in Tables and Comparing the two groups helping farmersgrowers to prevent food waste was selected by both as the most important factor in uencing demand Although many con sumers knew valueadded food is a solution to farmers food waste issues they did not necessarily show a willingness to buy valueadded food In contrast to those unwilling to buy valueadded food more in the willing group selected meeting consumer demand for healthy food andpositive e ects on the natural environment Cognitive factors in willingness to buy value added foods Ttests were performed to explore di erences between those willing responses and neutral or unwilling to buy a valueadded snack food product The willing group had higher awareness of food waste consequences general awareness of the intrinsic value of food as a scarce natural resource believed households are responsible for food waste andbelieved preventing food waste depends on individual actions Table Discussion conclusions Due to the scale of the food waste problem there is an urgent need to move towards a circular economy A circular economy model deals mainly with materials and resources Incorporating the consumer perspective into a circular economy model provides essential knowledge for decisionmakers This article presented ndings from a questionnaire undertaken to examine the willingness of Australian consumers to buyfood made from underutilised biomass Results illustrated there are signi cant di er ences in attitudes between those who are willing to buy valueadded foods and those who are neutral or unwilling Empathy and care for farmers welfare was a purchasing criterion By synthesising examples of circular activities products

did not have actual product experience Our results showed awareness of the consequences of food waste was signi cant in di erentiating between people who are willing to purchase valueadded foods and those who are not Furthermore consumers selected response options such as helping farmers and caring for the natural environment as factors that would motivate their purchase These ndings supports other studies highlighting morality is an in uential factor in explaining how people feel about food waste as well as their intentions to avoid wasting food Bortoleto et al Gjerris Gaiani Parizeau et al Setti et al Stancu et al Stefan et al Watson Meah Some scholars argue that raising customer awareness may lead to more sustainable behaviour Whitehair Shanklin Brannon Hence the recommendations this research o ers marketers is when designing marketing communications for a circular economy they should highlight empathy and care for farmers and show the various consequences of food waste for people and the natural environment as well as educate consumers about their responsibility in curbing food waste Although this article revealed themarket potential for novel valueadded foods caution is advisable Academic research on the adoption of innovations has shown that intentions are far from perfect predictors of behaviour Arts Frambach Bijmolt Findings linking willingness to buy value added food and consumers awareness of the food waste problem found correlation yet future research could be conducted to test if a causal relationship exists by usingother methods or statistical tests Future research may also wish to qualitatively explore consumer attitudes towards circular foods or circular economy principles how consumers can be involved in closing food waste loops ie by sharing food composting accepting seconds etcor whether ethical issues ie supporting farmers con ict with other considerations ie price quality perceptions avoiding packaged products eating fresh produce Food choice experiments or taste tests and willingness to purchase o er other alterna tives particularly since consumer taste is the single largest determinant of food choice Verbeke A diversity of factors explain early adoption of new products by con sumers and other theories such as the di usion of innovation model Rogers or theory of planned behaviour Ajzen may be useful to explain adoption This article s conceptual model may be used to incorporate other variables that increase or deter consumer demand for novel foods Bredahl Lusk et al such as environmental concerns personal values health concerns level of involvementwith food personality characteristics or productrelated attributes ie price taste branding ecocerti cation natural attributes etc Finally semistructured interviews with experts in the horticultural supply chain could be undertaken in relation to how the principles of a circular economy could be enacted the type of training and knowledge required and measures of
