vol clean technologies and environmental policy  perspective wastetoenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy jo van caneghem karel van acker johan de greef guido wauters carlo vandecasteele received december accepted march springerverlag gmbh germany part of springer nature abstract this paper reviews the role of conventional wastetoenergy ie incineration of mainly municipal solid waste with energy recovery in the circular economy it shows that although wastetoenergy figures on a lower level in the european waste hierarchy than recycling it plays from an overall sustainability point of view an essential complementary and facilitating role within the circular economy first of all wastetoenergy combusts or should combust only waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons this way wastetoenergy is compatible with recycling and only competes with landfill which is lower in the waste hierarchy furthermore wastetoenergy keeps material cycles and ultimately the environment and humans largely free from toxic substances finally wastetoenergy allows recovery of both energy and materials from nonrecyclable waste and hence contributes to keeping materials in circulation these arguments are elaborated and illustrated with many examples this paper also points out the pitfalls of a circular economy if it merely focuses on

caneghem et al introduction the term circular economy ce expresses a new concept that focuses on maintaining the value of products materials and resources in the economy for as long as possible and on minimizing waste generation european commission a the european commission a states that the ce will boost the eus competitiveness by protecting markets against scarcity of resources and volatile prices furthermore the transition towards a ce is believed to create new business opportunities and jobs and will imply innovative more efficient ways of producing and consum ing it is also presumed that a ce will save energy and will avoid irreversible damages to the environment and to society caused by the consumption of resources at a rate that exceeds the earths capacity to renew them european commission a the ce is a valuable concept with commendable objec tives which are however not always obvious to realize in the present economic and societal context of the proposed actions for the transition to a ce most concrete are the legislative proposals related to waste amending directive ec on waste which is the cornerstone of the european waste policy and legislation the packaging and packaging waste directive directive ec the landfill directive directive ec the directives on endoflife vehicles ec on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators ec and on waste electrical and electronic equipment directive eu figure graphically represents the eu waste hierarchy which is the basis of the eu waste policy and legislation and a key to the transition to a ce the waste hierarchy lists waste prevention higher than in decreasing order of priority reuse recycling recovery and disposal as a way to optimize resource efficiency and minimize environmental effects of waste management conventional wastetoenergy wte ie incineration of mainly municipal solid waste with energy recovery figures on the fourth level of the waste hierarchy fig so on a higher level than disposal ie landfill or waste combustion with insufficient energy recov ery but on a lower level than waste prevention preparing for reuse and recycling whereas it is widely recognized that disposal as a waste treatment option should be avoided the first three options seem to fit perfectly in the concept of the circular economy for wte the option in between it is unclear whether it maintains value in the economy for as long as possible or not indeed many stakeholders in the political and societal debate consider wte as a competitor for reuse and recycling and do not acknowledge its role in a ce whereas others on the contrary consider wte as indispensable to achieve the ce targets malinauskaite et al the hierarchy can be applied with some flexibility which means that eg for economic technical or environmental reasons recovery can be preferred over recycling this can for instance be the case for wastes containing toxic substances european commission merrild et al showed that although recycling of materials from municipal solid waste msw is commonly considered to be superior to other waste treatment alternatives for material fractions with a significant energy content this might not be the case if the treatment alternative is wte with a high energy recovery rate the authors showed by means of lca and assuming highperformance technologies for material recycling as well as for waste incineration that for paper glass steel and aluminium recycling has environmental benefits over wte for cardboard and plastic the results were less clear and depended on the level of energy recovery at the wte plant and on the considered system boundaries and impact categories after compar ing lca studies also laurent et al concluded that the environmental impact of msw treatment systems largely depends on the scope and local conditions such as waste composition energy recovery rate and avoided emissions and that no general priority in waste management technology can be put forward more recently rigamonti et al clearly pointed out that the quality of the materials obtained from recycling is often lower than that of virgin materials so they can only replace virgin materials to a certain sometimes limited extent how ever in most lca studies conducted so far full material substitution is assumed unrealistically favoring recycling over wastetoenergy in accordance haupt et al showed that the credits from material substitution and the assumed energy efficiency of wastetoenergy plants are key variables in lca of msw treatment schemes they pointed out that in countries with extensive separate msw collection schemes in place the environmental benefit of further increasing recycling rates is limited compared to the effect of increasing energy efficiency in wte plants fig schematic representation of the eu waste hierarchy as laid down in directive ecwaste toenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy from these considerations the obvious overall question is does wte still have a valuable role to play in a ce the european commissions answer to this question is rather prudent recognizing that wte can play a role in the transition to a ce european commission but that in order to ensure the full environmental and economic potential of a ce wte should coincide with higher levels of prevention reuse or recycling this paper shows by means of five key arguments that wte which to date fulfils an essential role in sustainable waste management will continue doing so in a ce fur ther in this paper wte refers to incineration of msw and by extension of hazardous waste with energy recovery which is the most applied type of wte other types of wte such as gasification or anaerobic digestion are not included in the scope of the arguments below wte combusts or should combust only waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons wte can be complementary and compatible with recy cling wte and by extension hightemperature combustion eg in a dedicated rotary kiln is essential to keep toxic substances out of materials and out of the environment wte allows recycling of a large part of the metals and inorganics in the waste wte can generate energy with high efficiency which can partly feed the ce the role of wte in a ce wte combusts or should combust only waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons the limitations of materials recycling were recently made clear by chinas ban on the import of lowquality recyclables in the frame of a broader environmental and health protection policy and in order to stimulate domestic recy cling for the last two decades many european and other industrialized countries have been shipping their lowquality recyclables ie waste not suitable for local recy clers such as mixed and soiled plastics to china or other developing countries where they are further processed or used as cheap fuel often in rudimentary circumstances brooks et al although this practice ensured high recycling rates for the exporting countries it ignored the recyclables quality problem and the environmental and human health effects of the recycling at its destination chinas ban has made clear that the right target for the recycling industry is not to achieve higher recycling rates but to produce more highquality recyclables iswa it also shows that the current technical and economic limitations of recycling should be recognized indeed highquality recycling at reasonable cost is not always feasible eg due to insufficient sorting or separation of waste streams at the source singh and ordonez some materials also suffer from degradation upon recycling ultimately limiting the number of times they can be recycled a typical example is the shortening of fibres in paper or textile delgadoaguilar et al ignatyev et al finally techniques to produce a recycled product or material meeting the quality andor functional standards or requirements of the consumer at a competitive cost may simply not yet exist ignatyev et al the technical and economic limitations of recycling may further be illustrated by the case of household pack aging waste for which wellestablished separate collection systems are in place in many regions and efficient sorting processes ensure relatively pure material streams with high recycling potential separate collection at the source is indeed essential to obtain clean waste streams for which recycling is technically and economically feasible janz et al singh and ordonez in flanders the northern region of belgium for instance source separation and collection of household packaging waste is well established household packaging waste is collected separately as pmd waste ie a mix of plastic bottles and flasks metal packaging such as tins and cans and drink cartons in highly automated sorting centres the separately collected pmd waste is further separated into four fractions a plastic fraction of the total mass collected a metal fraction drink cartons and a sorting residue which is sent to wte for final treatment vervaet et al in t of plastic bottles and flasks was recycled through this scheme ie mass of the t of plastic bottles and flasks brought on the market however this high recycling rate has to be put in the right perspective indeed it can only be obtained because the collected pmd waste is restricted to a limited number of rather easily separable and recyclable material types for this reason plastic foil bags and yoghurt pots which are composed of polymer types other than polyethylene terephthalate pet and highdensity polyethylene hdpe are for the time being excluded from the pmd waste because their separation into individually recyclable fractions is economically not yet viable this incompatible plastic packaging is therefore collected as residual waste and is treated in wte plants this case of flanders shows that high recycling rates of specific msw fractions can be established by strict sourceseparated collection however separation of waste composed of different difficult to separate materials eg food packaging or hygienic waste diapers paper tissues etc j van caneghem et al into recyclable fractions with an acceptable market value seems technically and economically impossible singh and ordonez such nonrecyclable waste is typically col lected as residual waste which is in line with the waste hierarchy preferably incinerated in wte plants this coin cides with less waste going to landfill according to grosso there is no generally applicable answer to the ques tion to which extent should material recycling be encour aged versus energy recovery because the answer is subject to specific local conditions at the current state of knowledge good quality waste materials eg with minimal contamination including high grade plastic items such as pet and hdpe bottles glass metals clean paper and cardboard are better recycled for such materials one should aim at real recycling yielding secondary materials of the same quality level than virgin materials grosso lowerquality waste materials such as mixed plastic polymers are however commonly downcycled to lowerquality materials singh and ordonez in this case wte treatment producing thermal and electric energy becomes as a competitive option grosso wte can be complementary and compatible with recycling figure shows how msw was treated in different euro pean countries in a distinction is made between recycling composting and digestion wastetoenergy ie incineration with sufficient energy recovery according to the r equation given in annex ii of directive ec r value if in operation before or r value if permitted after and disposal consisting on the one hand of incineration without or with insufficient energy recovery and on the other hand of landfill a first observation is that even within europe large regional differences exist between western and northern european countries and eastern and southern european countries the former have in general a lower disposal rate in than the eu average which goes along with higher recycling composting and digestion and wastetoenergy rates in fact in germany and flanders already reached the eus circular economy target for reuse and recycling of msw ie which is only to be reached by european commission b in several of these western european countries such as switzerland germany sweden belgium including flanders denmark the netherlands austria and norway a msw landfill ban is effectively in place they landfill less than of their msw in contrast the eastern and southern european countries have gener ally higher disposal rates than the eu average which goes along with lower recycling composting and digestion rates and with lower or even zero wastetoenergy rates these findings based on fig are in line with a recent study showing that the dedicated wte capacity for msw is unevenly distributed over eu member states wilts et al only six countries ie france germany italy the netherlands sweden and the uk account for more than of the total eus wte capacity the highest per capita wte capacity is found in sweden and denmark followed by the netherlands austria finland and belgium in contrast in most of the southern and eastern european countries not much dedicated wte capacity yet exists hence these countries still predominantly rely on landfill european commission the major drivers for high recycling and incineration rates in northern and western europe compared to southern and eastern europe are socioeconomic france and the countries to the left of france in fig except estonia and slovenia are all wealthy countries figuring in the top of the gdpcapita list of european countries international monetary fund they have the financial means to support the capex and opex of wte and of installations fig msw management in the different eu member states in eurostat data for flanders were obtained from vervaet et al switzerlan d german y flanders sweden belgiu m denmar k netherland s austri a norway estoni a finland luxembour g united kingdo m sloveni a

reuse and recycling waste toenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy for recycling composting and digesting and have the technology and the skilled workforce the good position low landfill of estonia and slovenia and the relatively bad position compared to their ranking according to gdpcapita of eg malta cyprus and spain malinauskaite et al shows that this is not the only reason environmental awareness in eg sweden and germany the environmental awareness movement has already for several decades been very active which is not the case in eg romania or poland high environmental activity motivates governments towards sustainable waste man agement availability and cost of land suitable or landfill which is influenced by population density wealth and production and consumption patterns of the population membership of the eu and for how long is also a driver as member countries should comply with the european waste legislation figure also clearly shows that countries with high wte rates also have high recycling rates wte and recy cling are thus complementary and compatible and advanced waste management systems as applied by the countries at the left in fig rely on both this does however not preclude variation of the relative importance from country to country depending on the local waste policy and priorities and the occurrence of incinerators and installations for separate collection sorting and recy cling of waste see below on overcapacities as it turns out countries with the highest rates of wte eg denmark norway and sweden all incinerating at least of their waste eurostat also tend to have high rates of recy cling and composting of organic materials and food waste but one can argue that if wte would not be applied at such large scale these countries with an environmentally conscious image would have even higher recycling rates germany for example incinerates less than of its msw and recycles more than a considerably better recycling rate than the plus of scandinavian countries seltenrich it can also be argued that in principle if wte complies with the requirement of only combusting waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons see wte combusts or should combust only waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons no competition exists between wte and recycling however as discussed in the ecs communication on the role of wte in the circular economy european commission it is essential to avoid future wte overcapacities as this is critical to avoid potential economic losses due to stranded assets and might hamper an increase in recycling rates again one can distinguish between member states with low or nonexistent wte capacity and high reliance on landfill typically eastern and southern european countries and member states with high wte capacity typically western and northern european countries the former should prioritize the development of separate collection systems and effective recycling infrastructure and thus divert waste from landfill european commission this is from a climate perspective particularly urgent for biodegrad able waste as diverting biodegradable waste from landfill reduces methane emissions jeswani and azapagic themelis and ulloa it was shown that diverting ton of biodegradable waste from a landfill towards anaerobic digestion to produce biogas and fertilizer can prevent up to ton of co equivalent emissions bernstad and jansen indeed for the separately collected organic fraction of msw such as kitchen and garden waste anaerobic digestion with recycling of the digestate as fertilizer could represent an attractive management option malinauskaite et al furthermore the expansion of wte capacity for treatment of nonrecyclable waste should always be considered from a longterm perspective taking into account aspects of waste availability which can change as a result of future development of separate collection systems capacity for cocombustion in industrial processes such as cement production and planned capacity expansion in neighbour ing countries or regions european commission if expansion of wte capacity is justified obviously the newtobuild plants have to use stateoftheart technology with the highest possible energy and material efficiency and have to comply with the legislation in place eg concerning air emissions european commission when both wte and recycling techniques are in place in the present technological and economic context a large part of recycling can only stand thanks to legal obligations taxes as well as sometimes significant subsidies in various forms typically supported by the extended producer responsibility concept this can be countered by increasing incineration taxes or decreasing financial support for wte whether or not combined with increasing landfill taxes furthermore older less efficient wte plants can be phased out european commission the data in fig do not take into account the amount of household waste that is littered ie waste that unintentionally ends up in the environment or is sometimes even intentionally dumped examples are waste transported by wind or animals from landfills into the environment which is avoided in wte plants where waste is contained in closed bunkers or waste abandoned eg in road shoulders woods or rivers in flanders for instance in about t of litter was collected by the local communities corresponding to kg per person per year ie about of the amount of collected residual waste kg per person kplusv de groof and vandecruys however j van caneghem et al the amount of litter that is not collected and accumulated in the different environmental compartments is probably much higher the discussion above only considers europe on a global level of msw is disposed of in landfills is recy cled or composted and is recovered in wte plants the remaining of msw is littered or openly dumped kaza et al waste management varies considerably by income and region open dumping predominantly prevails in lowincome countries where about of the waste is openly burned or dumped on roads and open land or in waterways as the income of a country increases a first step towards more sustainable waste management is construction and use of landfills whereas only middle and highincome countries apply recycling composting and wte kaza et al this evolution in waste management can be illustrated by the case of china in the msw collection rate in this country was only about and waste management consisted mainly of open dumping in the msw collection rate had increased to and about of the collected waste was landfilled composted and incinerated by the msw collection rate had increased to with of the collected msw landfilled composted or recycled and incinerated the number of wte plants increased from in to in with a corresponding increase in incineration capacity from to t per year zhang et al a next step in chinas waste management policy is the introduction of separate collection and recycling zhang et al nevertheless the statement that highincome countries apply recycling composting and wte may not hold true for all developed countries in the usa for instance of the generated msw is recycled or composted is treated in wte plants and the remaining is still landfilled us environmental protection agency so although the usa is higher in the gdp per capita list than all but a few western european countries interna tional monetary fund landfill remains the most applied msw treatment option yet also in the usa there is a trend towards more recycling and wte although less pronounced than in the western european countries the percentage of msw that is recycled increased from in to in and the share of wte increased from less than to over the same period of time wte and by extension hightemperature combustion eg in a dedicated rotary kiln is essential to keep toxic substances out of materials and out of the environment toxic substances in recycled materials special attention has to be paid to the dissipation of toxic substances in recycled materials instead of focusing only on maintaining materials in circulation as long as possible this can be illustrated by the example of bisphenol a bpa in recycled paper bpa is added as a colour developer in ther mal paper commonly used for example sales receipts due to its oestrogenic properties bpa is considered an endocrine disruptor and is classified as a category reproductive toxic substance meaning it is alarming for human fertility geens et al a dermal contact to paper is recognized as one of the human exposure routes to bpa geens et al b in europe paper is recycled on average times and about of the raw material for the pulp and paper industry is used paper cepi as thermal paper is typically collected together with other waste paper it is introduced in the paper recycling loop and this way bpa is dissipated over a variety of paper products this was confirmed by pivnenko et al who showed that in danish paper and board samples the bpa concentration ranged from to gg they pointed out that recycling of waste paper was the main source of bpa contamination in paper products which is sustained by the chemical and physical properties of bpa an interesting general conclusion of this study was that massbased recycling targets do not ensure highquality recycled materials as was already discussed in section wte combusts or should combust only waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons a recent report issued by the european commission acknowledges that the collection and recycling targets in the european waste legislation merely focus on increasing the amounts of recycled materials not on their quality regarding the absence of toxic substances goldenman et al the report also states that no quality standards exist for toxic substances in recycled materials as well as virgin materials except for the endofwaste criteria which exist only for a few material types hence the european legislation in place does not encourage activities to decontaminate waste or recycled materials another type of pollutants possibly present in materi als are the persistent organic pollutants pops because of their particular combination of physical and chemical properties they remain intact for many years or even decades once released into the environment as a consequence they become widely distributed over the different environmental compartments where they constitute a chronic source of exposure for plants and animals and also for humans directly or indirectly the toxic effects of pops typically accumulating in fatty tissue include cancer allergies damage to the nervous system endocrine disruption and developmental effects li et al the stockholm convention which entered into force in currently lists pops whose production and use is eliminated or reduced or for which measures have to be taken to reduce unintentional release listed pops include insecticides such as ddt industrial waste toenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and unintentionally released pops such as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans pcddfs because of their historical release and persistence pops have become ubiquitous in the environment this was demonstrated amongst others by jamieson et al who analysed pop levels in amphipods caught in the kermadec and mariana trench in the north pacific at km below sea level which is believed to be one of the most remote and inaccessible habitats on earth surprisingly the pop contaminant levels in the deep sea amphipods were considerably higher than documented for sediments or other marine fauna in nearby heavy industrialized regions a danger of recycling without eliminating pops or mate rials contaminated with pops is that they are not removed from the material cycle as illustrated by pivnenko et al for brominated flame retardants in plastics pops can have much farther reaching effects when they enter the food chain as one of many food contamination incidents the belgian pcbdioxin incident of clearly illustrates the dangers and potential far reaching consequences of recycling products contaminated with pops l of discarded transformer oil askarel containing kg of pcb oil and g of dioxins were accidently added to the household waste fat collection point in a waste recycling centre the contaminated fat was processed together with other waste fats and used for the production of ton of animal feed that was delivered to more than animal and dairy farms the true cause and scope of the contamination became only clear months after the original contamination in the recycling centre and after fat of affected animals had already been rerecycled into the animal food chain van houte and paque eventually all contaminated food was removed from the market and thermally destructed par tially in wte plants van larebeke et al estimated the total number of cancers resulting from human exposure during this incident to range between and another aspect to consider is that for some waste types recycling is more harmful than the production from virgin material an example is the recycling of weee plastics containing toxic polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes as a flame retardant evidence from studies suggests that the main effect of longterm exposure to low doses of lower brominated diphenyl ethers is damage to the reproductive system atsdr the main route of exposure for the general population is ingestion of house dust and inhalation of indoor air containing pbdes emitted from consumer products particularly electronic equipment atsdr because of their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity tetra penta hexa hepta and decabromodiphenyl ether were added as pop to annex a of the stockholm convention meaning that their production and use is to be eliminated in view of this article and annex vii of directive eu on waste of electrical and electronic equipment weee state that proper treatment and recycling or recovery of weee has to include as a minimum the removal of plastic parts containing brominated flame retardants bfrs such as pbdes a first problem in recycling these removed weee plastics is that they may contain prohibited pbdes that are not destroyed in the recycling process and hence are dissipated over the recycled products zennegg et al this way the pbdes remain in the material cycle and the recy cled products remain a source of human exposure to these prohibited toxic substances another problem in the recy cling of pbdecontaining plastics is that upon recycling highly toxic polybrominated dibenzodioxins and furans pbddfs can be formed that are either immediately or during later use emitted from the recycled plastics mak ing them a potential source of human exposure schlummer et al zennegg et al schlummer et al stated that besides sophisticated waste stream management and input control measures extractive processes removing bromine from the waste plastics before extrusion can elimi nate pbdes from the plastic material cycle and prevent for mation of pbddfs they acknowledge however that these extraction technologies are not available on an industrial scale probably because the high energy and infrastructural demands of these processes increase the recycling cost so that the recycled plastics become too expensive compared to plastics made from virgin materials as a consequence in the present economic context wte remains the only endoflife technology in place for pbdecontaining plastics that ensures destruction of these toxic flame retardants with recovery of the calorific value and with only very limited wellcontrolled emission of pbddfs vehlow et al this case of weee plastics shows that for wastes containing toxic substances recycling is not always the preferential treatment option from a human health perspective the examples above show that it is necessary to first isolate toxic substances from the material cycle to prevent them from being dissipated over recycled materials and the environment ultimately leading to human exposure the isolated materials then have to be treated in such a way that the toxic substances are either destroyed or definitively removed from the environment for waste contaminated with low levels of pops combustion in wte plants under conditions as laid down in the industrial emission directive ied ie respecting a residence time of the combustion gases of at least s at more than c is the only treatment option in this regard for waste containing high pop concentrations specific hightemperature combustion techniques such as a rotary kiln with a secondary combustion chamber are applied in practice to guarantee complete destruction van caneghem et al a indeed whereas in wte plants incinerating msw the legal provision of s and c is only obtained in the gas phase in hazardous waste j van caneghem et al incinerators these conditions are also maintained in the solid phase in the primary combustion chamber thus guaranteeing destruction and destruction and removal efficiencies de and dre see eqs and required by unep research in realscale wte plants showed that pops such as pcddfs pcbs and pbes are largely destroyed upon combustion whereas the amount of pcddfs and pcbs newly formed upon cooling of the flue gases in the steam boiler is limited and to a great extent independent of the pop concentration in the input waste vehlow et al van caneghem et al a b vermeulen et al for hazardous waste incinerators des above and dres above have been reported for pop wastes unep for wte plants incinerating nonhazardous waste such as msw or similar commercial waste almost no des or dres have been reported in literature based on the pop input and output data range reported by van caneghem et al b in the considered fluidised bed combustor for pcbs des between and taking into account variations in composition of inputs and outputs were obtained in case the usual waste feed consisting of rdf and sludge was combusted and between and in case the waste feed consisted of asr rdf and sludge the given des and dres show that modern wte plants are overall pop sinks since they eliminate more pops than they produce it should be noted that de and dre depend on the operating conditions eg temperature time turbulence waste throughput and the type of waste ts and are hence different and specific for each installation and waste input wang et al heavy metals in contrast to toxic organic substances toxic heavy metals present in waste are not destroyed in a wte process but are concentrated in the solid residues their partitioning over bottom ash boiler ash and air pollution control apc residue depends on the speciation of the metal in the waste the presence of other elements with which the metals can bind to give a volatile compound and on temperature residence time and mixing conditions in the furnace belevi and moench halogens are instrumental in volatilizing metal elements since metal halides chlorides and bromides typically have melting and boiling points below the temperatures depop content in input waste total pop content in incinerator outputs pop content in input waste dre pop content in input waste pop content in ue gas emitted at stack pop content in input wastein the furnace in general the higher the temperature in the furnace the higher is the fraction of heavy metals that transfers to the gas phase and the lower the fraction in the bottom ash with respect to their transfer to the combustion gas two groups of heavy metals can be distinguished cr co mn and ni that are mainly transferred to the gas phase by entrainment their transfer coefficients are determined by their speciation and distribution in the waste and more than of the amount present in the waste remains in the bottom ash cu mo pb sn zn sb as cd and hg for which evaporation is the main transfer process their transfer coefficients are not only determined by their speciation and distribution in the waste but also by chemical and physical conditions and kinetics in the combustion process the percentage of these elements that remains in the bottom ash ranges from cu to about hg belevi and moench due to the enrichment of certain heavy metals such as hg pb zn and sb direct recovery of boiler ash or apc residue as building material is not possible from an environmental and health perspective furthermore boiler ash and apc residue each about kgt msw represent a much smaller mass than bottom ash on average about kgt msw vandecasteele et al iswa therefore wte boiler ash and apc residue are typically stabilized and solidified with cement and the resulting monolith is discharged on a hazardous waste landfill which is specially designed with natural and artificial liners and drainage systems to prevent leaching of toxic substances to the environment billen et al a block et al this way waste incineration with subsequent solidification and stabilization and controlled landfill of the generated apc residues prevents heavy metal dissipation in recycled materials and assures their storage in a safe sink emission of air pollutantscombustion of waste in wte plants results in the generation of flue gases that contain besides the products of incomplete combustion mentioned in section toxic substances in recycled materials gaseous pollutants such as so hcl nox co and particulate matter pm yet wte plants have to comply with stringent emission limit values elvs as shown in table comparing the elvs for wte plants and waste toenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy other combustion plants as laid down in the eu industrial emission directive directive ec hence wte plants are equipped with extensive flue gas cleaning equipment generally consisting of selective catalytic or noncatalytic reduction of nox neutralization of acid gases by injection of lime or an alkaline solution adsorption of eg dioxins and mercury on activated carbon and dust filtration in a bag filter or electrostatic precipitator vandecasteele et al van caneghem et al as a result of this extensive flue gas cleaning the concentrations of the regulated pollutants in the gases that are emitted at the stack of wte plants are generally a factor below the emission limit values table the emission of pollutants to air from wte plants is limited and in each case lower than for conventional energy production resulting in considerable avoided environmental impacts as shown by eg by billen et al b and jeswani and azapagic wte allows recycling of a large part of the metals and inorganics in the waste wte allows material recovery with possible subsequent recycling from nonrecyclable waste bottom ash ba which is by far the major residue of wte is a heterogeneous material mainly consisting of ash stones and metals and has a broad particle size distribution generally from to mm diameter the inorganic fraction of the msw stones silicates glass metals and metal compounds typically leaves the grate furnace or fluidized bed almost unchanged in a rotary kiln for treatment of hazardous waste the inorganic fraction generally rather fuses from msw ba the metals which are in fact the most valuable fraction and the mineral fraction which has the largest mass and volume can be recycled for recycling as building material the mineral fraction of ba should comply with local legal concentration andor leaching limits which are most often exceeded for cu mo sb cl and so vandecasteele et al described the indaver wet ba treatment scheme in which in view of recycling ferrous metals are removed by overhead magnets whereas nonferrous metals are removed by eddy current separation moreover three mineral fractions are obtained which can be used as building material two granular fractions mm and mm together around kgt msw and a sand fraction mm around kgt msw after ageing carbonation for about months the granulate fractions show low metal leaching and comply with the heavy metal leaching regulations the major application of these compliant ba fractions is in uncontained bulk applications such as artificial hills or as subbase in road construction embankments or noise barriers verbinnen et al uncontained application means that no barriers such as liners have to be provided to isolate the ash or the mixture of ash with other building materials from the surrounding soil and that no intensive monitor ing or aftercare of the groundwater has to be provided van caneghem et al verbinnen et al the fine sludge fraction mm around kgt msw contains the highest concentration of toxic substances and can be used eg as cover layer on hazardous waste landfills vandecasteele et al in general leaching of heavy metals is the main chemical barrier for uncontained application of wte ba as bulk building material over the last decade wte ba treatment has significantly improved verbinnen et al iswa to increase the recovery rate and improve the purity of the separated materials indeed in addition to the wet treatment process discussed above a half dry moist treatment adr was developed inashco in which a ballistic separator is used for separating fines

leaching of cu and sb were developed arickx et al van caneghem et al these developments in principle allow almost the whole ba fraction to be recycled besides its application as uncontained building material wte ba can also be used as replacement for sand gravel or cement in construction applications as raw material in cement production and as feedstock for production of ceramic materials verbinnen et al in cement and concrete applications besides heavy metals also chlorides can limit the use of ba the chloride concentration in ba depends on the composition of the incinerated waste but is in general relatively high chloride can cause corrosion in the cement kiln and can lower the cement quality making it eg more corrosive towards the steel wiremeshing in reinforced concrete however

sand gravel or cement replacement the latter after activation some problems may occur such as formation of popouts due to reaction between al zn and basic cement material leading to hydrogen gas moreover swelling and cracking may occur due to formation of ettringite ca alsoohho around al grains these problems can be solved by enhanced removal of metallic al and zn from ba verbinnen et al the potential of recycling wte ba in cement is sustained by the fact that in the eu in around mt cement was produced per year cembureau and that about t of raw materials clay limestone is needed per t of cement schorcht et al taking into account that up to of raw material can be replaced by properly treated ba see before for chloride removal without any negative impact on the end quality of the cement verbinnen et al around mtyear of ba can be potentially used in cement production this amount exceeds about times the mtyear of mswi ba actually produced in europe kahle et al based on data reported in annual or sustainability reports of european wte plant operators typically kg of fer rous metals and kg of nonferrous metals mainly al cu and zn are recovered per t of msw incinerated and sold to secondary metal recyclers this way wte enables to reintroduce a part of the metals present in nonrecyclable andor residual waste in the economy classification of waste as hazardous or nonhazardous is based on commission decision ec on the list of waste low amended by commission decision eu and annex iii of the waste framework directive ec wfd amended by regulation klymko et al the latter defines hazard properties to consider in the evaluation of the hazardousness of a waste including eg flammability hp carcinogenicity hp and corrosiveness hp an assessment of the hazard properties of eu ba showed that it is in general nonhazardous by hp to hp and by hp however for hp ecotoxicity the results are debatable based on the total metal content ba should be considered as hazardous waste by hp whereas based on the more realistic heavy metal leaching from ba at its natural ph ph this residue can be classified as nonhazardous klymko et al also in recent legislation regulating the use of wte ba as building material such as the dutch decree on soil quality limit values set to prevent damage to the ecosystem only consist of realistic leached concentrations at natural ph dutch decree on soil quality wte can generate energy with high efficiency that can partly feed the ce a wte plant is generally equipped with a steam boiler for energy recovery from the hot combustion gases the steam generated in the boiler can be applied in a rankine power cycle generating electricity with a turbine as in a fossil fuel power plant part of the electricity is used internally the remaining is usually supplied to the grid the net electric efficiency achieved in stateoftheart wte plants is gener ally around which is modest compared to conventional coal power plants de greef et al this is because in wte boilers the steam temperature is typically limited to c compared to eg c in power plants to avoid hightemperature corrosion indeed due to the chemical and physical composition of the msw combustion gasses in wte plants contain high concentrations of acids metal spe cies and dust leading to phenomena of fouling and corrosion lee et al de greef et al through application of advanced cladding and coating of metal heat exchanging surfaces it is possible to apply higher steam parameters this is eg the case at the aeb wte plant in amsterdam where an advanced steam cycle c bar reheating of steam is applied which affords a net electrical efficiency of more than aeb amsterdam construction of such an installation is however complicated and expensive and also the operation costs are higher than in conventional wte plants in wte plants as in conventional power production pro cesses there are three main possibilities for energy generation and application electricity is generated through a rankine cycle and the residual energy heat is lost in the cooler after the condenser which affords a limited overall waste toenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy energy efficiency as shown above low pressure steam or hot water from the condenser after the turbine is applied as heat source in a combined heat and power chp scheme which increases the overall energy efficiency of the wte plant or the hightemperature steam from the boiler is partly directly provided as a process heat source to nearby industry vandecasteele et al de greef et al this approach may afford the highest overall energy efficiency of up to this percentage takes into account at the input side besides the energy content of the waste the energy content of other flows eg combustion air and leakage air flows and also the typical evaporation losses from the waste and from supplementary liquid flows eg injected ammonia water for sncr moreover this efficiency also takes into account radiation losses and losses at heat exchangers in case the hot water or low pressure steam is used for heating eg of greenhouses hospitals or residences by means of a district heating network in countries with a high heat demand and district heating infrastructure in place such as the scandinavian countries it has become common practice to use heat from wte plants for public heating purposes cities like copenhagen vienna and paris have large district heating networks fed by wte incinerators located in or close to the city hofor wien energie cpcu this has the additional advantage of requiring only short msw transportation distances in case wte plants located in industrial areas directly supply highpressure steam to neighbouring companies a very recent example is the ecluse steam network ecluse which connects via a steam duct and a condensate return duct a cluster of wte plants with neighbouring industrial companies the wte cluster consists of three grate furnace incinerators operated by indaver mainly combust ing household and commercial waste vandecasteele et al and of three fluidized bed combustors operated by sleco combusting sludge and industrial waste van caneghem et al b all located on the same site in the waasland port east of antwerp flanders belgium the six incineration lines have an overall waste throughput of around ton per year and a heat production power of around mw th the port of antwerp is home to the largest chemical cluster in europe the chemical industry is very energy intensive and its energy consumption is very stable over time in the chemical industry heat in the form of steam is typically used for unit operations such as distillation evaporation or drying and to drive endothermic chemical reactions to date the steam needed by the chemical processes is in general produced on site using natural gas as energy source in a chp scheme in the construction of the new ecluse steam network was started which will deliver highpressure steam c bar produced in the wte cluster to a network of neighbouring industrial chemical companies in a first phase starting beginning which corresponds to capacity ecluse will provide process steam for five chemical companies in a sub sequent second phase the remaining of steam produced will cover the expected increased consumption of the existing consumers andor will feed a new chemical cluster this way ecluse consumers no longer have to produce heat from fossil fuel avoiding the yearly emission of hundreds of thousands tonnes of co ecluse the new steam network fits in the green heat action plan of the flemish government aiming at increasing the proportion of green heat in the renewable energy supply in the region in case no heating network is available or if it is eco nomically not viable to build such a network direct supply to a single neighbouring heat consumer is another option to increase the overall energy efficiency of wte plants de greef et al an interesting example is the greater manchester waste project lines where annually ton of partly pretreated msw and solid residues of biomass digestion are treated with a power of mw th and mwel in a combined heat and power scheme the produced highpressure steam and electricity are delivered to inovyns runcorn manufacturing site located next to the wte plants viridor alternative wte technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis often claim a higher overall energy efficiency than conventional waste combustion mainly because the produced calorific gas would allow electricity generation with a higher efficiency however starting from msw the produced syngas contains high concentrations of gaseous pollutants such as hcl and h s and tars hence gasifi cation and pyrolysis plants require either extensive waste pretreatment or gas treatment which decreases the overall energy efficiency furthermore the higher complexity of gasification plants compared to conventional wte plants leads to more difficulties in operation additional maintenance and reduced reliability resulting in higher investment and operational costs lombardi et al these reasons explain why in practice almost no cases of longterm operation of fullscale msw gasification plants exist and conventional wte in grate furnaces or fluidized beds remains today the most apt and most applied technology for energy and material recovery from residual nonrecyclable msw quicker et al castaldi et al plasma pyrolysis of certain special waste types containing heavy metals such as galvanic sludges has the advantage that due to the very high temperatures obtained in the plasma c quicker et al the bottom ash is vitrified decreasing the metal leaching vieira cubas et al allowing the formed plasma rock to be recycled as building material instead of landfilled however the use of electricity to generate the plasma decreases the overall energy efficiency of the pyrolysis plant quicker et al and it remains to be j van caneghem et al proven that the increased costs are offset by the income from the plasma rock only a limited amount of data on plasma treatment and waste gasification in general is available in the literature making it difficult to quantitatively compare their energetic and materials performance with that of conventional wte bosmans et al wte and its role in the circular economy as discussed in sections wte combusts or should com bust only waste that is nonrecyclable for economic technical or environmental reasons and wte and by extension hightemperature combustion eg in a dedicated rotary kiln is essential to keep toxic substances out of materials and out of the environment for certain types of waste generated in todays society such as mixed wastes composites contaminated materials or wastes containing toxic substances within the present technoeconomical context recycling might not be the best option from an overall sustainability point of view ie taking into account environmental economic and societal and health aspects so a ce should not only focus on maintaining materials as long as possible in the economy and on decreasing resource depletion but also has to consider economic environmental social and health aspects the three pillars of sustainability when the best most sustainable waste treatment option is selected figure schematically represents the material flows and the role that wte and waste recycling could fulfil in a ce it shows in the circle that human activities in different fields eg agriculture industry services and households generate waste in a sustainable ce the most suitable treatment option for the different waste types generated is determined by economic environmental as well as societal and health criteria for probably the largest part of the waste recycling is the most sustainable treatment option this waste is after processing largely reintroduced in the economy preferably in the same application for another smaller fraction of the waste eg hygienic mixed and contaminated waste or waste containing toxic substances wte or in case the waste is classified as hazardous dedicated combustion in a hazardous waste incinerator is the preferred treatment option wte converts the nonrecyclable waste into energy that is delivered back to society including the recycling industry and into solid residues that are partly recycled as building material or as secondary metal indicated by the grey arrow to the recycling industry and partly stabilizedsolidified to be stored in a safe sink sorting residues from recycling activities are either sent to wte for energy recovery or after appropriate treatment to a safe sink this way wte and more in general incinerators includ ing dedicated combustors for hazardous waste fulfils in the ce the role of a gatekeeper enabling material recovery from nonrecyclable waste while keeping recovered materials free from toxic substances a key factor to reduce the amounts of nonrecyclable waste to be treated in wte plants is ecodesign which should take into account the sustainability of the endoflife treatment of a product as one of the design parameters singh and ordonez ecodesign can enhance the recyclability of products eg by selecting andor limiting material types by allowing for quick and easy disassembly and by avoiding the presence of known toxic substances with regard fig schematic representation of the material flows and the role of wte and waste recycling in a ce waste toenergy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy to the latter goldenman et al acknowledge that a need exists for strategies and implementation instruments preventing toxic substances from entering consumer goods and material cycles conclusions enhancing highlevel material recycling is essential in the transition towards a ce although wte figures on a lower level in the european waste hierarchy than recycling it plays from an overall sustainability point of view an essential complementary and facilitating role within the ce indeed wte is the preferred treatment option for waste that in the present context cannot be recycled moreover wte does not have to compete with recycling but rather with landfill which is lower in the waste hierarchy furthermore wte keeps material cycles and ultimately the environment and humans free from toxic substances finally wte not only allows recovering energy from nonrecyclable waste but also allows recycling of some materials from such waste unrestrained allowance in the recycling system of waste containing toxic substances such as pops or heavy metals can increase the environmental and health impact of recy cled materials legislators should be aware that a onesided focus on increasing recycling volumes can lead to a quality deterioration and to dissipation of toxic substances in recy cled materials instead of only increasing recycling volumes or masses the quality of the recyclables and the elimination of toxic substances in consumer goods should be the first priority in the transition towards a circular economy in this regard wte fulfils an essential role as a gatekeeper by destroying and eliminating toxic substances from the material cycles furthermore wte offers a treatment method for waste that is eg because of its heterogeneous composition today not recyclable from an economic point of view while recovering valuable energy and materials as long as contaminated material streams are generated or present in our society decontamination and hence wte remain a necessary part of the ce the ultimate solution towards a fully ce is ecodesign that not only takes into account the technical and functional specifications but also considers the endoflife aspects of products although in an ideal ce scenario wte is phased out completely because all material streams are clean and can be fully recycled in an economically viable way it is more realistic to expect that wte will remain necessary at least for many decades if it can be phased out at all indeed on the one hand for new materials although often designed as green alternative to highly contaminat ing materials the true environmental and health impact may only be discovered after many years eg asbestos cfcs pcbs etc during which the material cycles andor the environment have already been contaminated on the other hand material degradation upon recycling cannot be avoided entailing nonrecyclable material residues hence in the future wte is likely to remain a necessary even essential part of the ce but will probably treat lower amounts of waste as further progress is made in waste prevention and reuse which are both higher in the hierarchy than recycling as well as in ecodesign in avoidance of toxic substances and in improvement of recycling technology which allow all three higherquality recycling
