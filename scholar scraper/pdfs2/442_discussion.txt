Our study has examined  how young adults in Finland  per- 
ceive the connection  of the CE to their everyday  lives. Among  the 
themes  that emerged  from the student  responses,  it is evident  that 
recycling  and reuse are the dominant  ways of operationalizing  the 
CE in everyday  life. The familiar  roles of recycler  and consumer  
(even if of second-hand  goods) are what students  mostly connect  
to being active in a CE. Despite  the fact that our respondents  are 
young adults and therefore  represent  the generation  of “digital  na- 
tives”, the ICT-enabled  reuse activities  of renting,  borrowing  and 
sharing  were hardly mentioned  at all. In other words, access-based  
ways of consuming  are not yet the “new normal”,  and their uptake 
is going slower than hoped. This is in line with earlier research  
that has shown that for a number  of reasons  (desire  to own, lack 
of trust, safety doubts,  etc.), access-based  consumption  is not yet 
that popular,  even among  young adults (Gullstrand  Edbring  et al., 
2016).
