Based on the in-case, cross-case analysis along with propositions and 
the proposed framework (Fig. 2), we consider that our study offer some 
unique and interesting contributions to the debate involving big data 
analytics as a dynamic capability to enable circular economy objectives 
while involving large stakeholders as decision makers. This study can be 
viewed as an integration effort from three fields, i.e. operations research, 
environmental management, and information systems. In the past, re-
searchers like Gupta et al. (2019) and Jabbour et al. (2020) tried to link 
information systems and environmental management literature. How-
ever, these studies harnessed different business models and the rela-
tionship between big data and the circular economy instead of including 
stakeholders as decision makers. Firms operating in the field of circular 
operations can work with other relevant stakeholders to have a wider 
reach and optimize decision making. For instance, LATU (focuses on 
reduce, re-use, and recycle) has signed an agreement with JCSC to 
implement circular economy operations effectively. Based on what has 
been learned from CTL (focus on reuse, rethink, recycle, and recover) 
operating in African countries, circular economy activities should be 
designed to have maximum impact on the environment, society and the
