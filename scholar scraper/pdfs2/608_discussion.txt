and  conclusion
The  COVID  pandemic  has  devastated  the  food  production  sys-
tem, which poses several  threats  and  repercussions.  The  threat
of  national lockdowns  in  several  countries  has  contributed  to  the
excessive  storage  of  food  products  and  other  packaging  items
related  to  processed  foods,  food  deliveries  etc.,  resulting  in  a  dis-
turbing  cycle  of  waste  management  development  (Albahli  et  al.,
2021 ;  Abdulkareem  et  al.,  2021 ).  The  challenge  of  sorting  and  classi-
ﬁcation  of  waste  is  investigated  in  this  study,  considering  the  circu-
lar  economy  context,  where  recycling  output  is  used  as  a  resource  tothe industries. In  such  practices,  sorting  and  classiﬁcation  will  inﬂu-
ence the recycling  yields.  Hence,  an  AI-based  automated  solution
is  proposed.  The  proposed  model  performance  is  veriﬁed  by  con-
ducting the  simulated  experiments.  Here,  the  classiﬁcation  is  done
using  a  decision  level  fusion  scheme  and  machine  learning  tech-
niques  by  aiming  for  the  correct  separation  of  waste  in  recycling
categories—four  trash  categories  such  as  glass,  metal,  COVID-19
waste,  and  plastic.  The  ﬁndings  indicate  that  the  proposed  fusion
scheme  is  signiﬁcantly  superior  to  the  Single  Best  Performance  Fea-
ture  Scheme.  The  classiﬁcation  achieved  96.5  %  accuracy,  95.3  %
sensitivity  and  speciﬁcity  of  95.9  %  while  using  SVM  as  a  classiﬁer.
