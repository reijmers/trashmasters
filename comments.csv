I live in the UK and have weekly food waste and paper waste disposal, bi-weekly large green bins Canada style along with mixed recycling black bin. So I put all the bins out this Monday on collection day in a row and for some reason was the only house on the street not to have their food waste and paper recycling collected. I checked the food waste bin like &quot;Huh maybe this was emptied.&quot; only to open it and be greeted with a writhing ocean of maggots at the bottom in my food waste. Actually vile. The imagine is going to haunt me and live rent free in my head for weeks if not months. I wish we had collections like this but I am stuck in shitty UK suburbia, much more walkable and accessible than North American suburbs but still terribly lonely and now I am discovering inefficient in so many other ways :D"

Perhaps it is just the stubbornness of expectation, but I just find it more convenient to pop into my garage or around the corner of the building with my 60-liter bag and toss it, and don&#39;t mind the weekly trash collection and fortnightly recycling collection.

Usually one for paper, one for plastic, one for organic, one for residual, in some citys one further one for metal. Every bin is collected on a different day of the week and in different periods (eg. residual every week, paper every two, etc.). You could imagine how I hate Garbage day even more.

2022-01-09T01:44:02Z,2022-01-09T01:44:02Z,0,"You completely missed the point, here. We always had big communal bins at the end of the street pretty much everywhere in Europe (some of them underground and some of them above the ground). In recent years, governments and local authorities have shifted to small private bins. Small bins encourage recycling. The volume of the bin is your weekly quota of trash and if you exceed it you have to store the trash somewhere else. Moreover, countries like Italy are starting to experiment with very strict quotas: pretty much everything has to be recycled and you have few bags *per year* of unrecyclable trash. If you recycle too little, you&#39;ll consume all your quota and have to call the council to get the mixed trash taken (and pay for the service). All of this starts with small and private bins for each household."

2021-11-19T07:02:58Z,2021-11-19T07:02:58Z,0,"In Munich, we also have a similar system and it sucks hard. The reasons are: 1) The containers have a size, so that they are almost guaranteed full, when the garbage truck comes. The result is that in weeks where people have lots of trash (by coincidence), the containers are massively overflowing. Then you can either be a dick and pour your garbage also besides the container or take it back home - or as I also did once, throw the plastic waste into the container for residual waste. After all a lot of plastics is not recyclable anyways. However, I think due to this the plastic recycling percentage is very low in Munich. 2) I don&#39;t have my plastic waste in bags, because it&#39;s stupid to buy and use bags only to throw them away. I have my plastic waste in a plastic box. However, when it&#39;s windy outside, it&#39;s virtually impossible to go to the container with the box without some light plastic being blown away. Even if you used a lid, you still get the problem once you open the box to empty it into the container. Also, due to the small hole in the container, I have to touch each and every item again and potentially have dirty stinky finger afterwards. In the city where I lived before, we had 1100l containers that could be fully opened. There, I can just open it and pour everything from the box into the container without touching it. If there is some wind shielding around, this even works nicely on windy days... I am not saying that the system is generally useless, but in Munich the implementation is just shit..."

Every town has a completely different list of the stuff they will take and a different schedule of when they take it.  Most places have different collections for rubbish, recycling and garden waste.

2021-11-16T04:06:54Z,2021-11-16T04:06:54Z,0,I personally don&#39;t feel any negativity towards the bin system in Toronto as it is something that takes 2 minutes a week which you can easily just slot that time whenever you leave and come back from work. As for the raccoons my area used to have a lot but I usually just left a brick on top of it and they left it alone. The wheels on the bins I felt were big and good at going up and down steps. When they were emptied they were very light and easy to take up and downs steps and you could basically carry it just trying to drag it up steps because of the weight. A huge flaw with the system however was the weekly alternating schedule of garbage and recycling pickup as if you missed a garbage day you&#39;d have to wait 2 weeks. Something similar happened where one of the garbage bags was wedged into the bottom therefore not being emptied and made us have an extra bag of garbage laying around for 2 weeks in the bin.  A question: In Amsterdam do they use dumpsters for apartments and other residential buildings in a similar way that Toronto does it?

Or, they&#39;d carry the bag to within 2 metres of the proper receptacle, and dump it on the ground close to it. What a wonderfully backward modern INconvenience you have invented! Look, here&#39;s what science, progress, and increasing wealth is supposed to achieve: MORE convenience. Not LESS!I see absolutely no advantage to city dwellers in this system, and would not want it implemented here. I have three bins, one small one for green waste, one medium sized for landfill, and one large for recycling. The green waste bin is collected each week, and the other two on alternating weeks. It&#39;s a tremendous system, which still gets abused by our lazy, careless, and stupid citizens. :P"

I went from twice monthly pickup to a twice monthly (summer) and once a month pickup (ridiculous) considering food recycling is every 2 weeks all year and the bins never are filled. This would work even up north by installing less Amsterdam style bins at greater distances  for all those missed pickups. Add a couple in the park and one set by the mayor&#39;s office and no more stay garbage everywhere by bears, racoons and deer."
2021-11-15T06:47:14Z,2021-11-15T06:47:14Z,0,Cool system but couldn&#39;t you also automate sorting out the recycling?Why do you insist on sorting the garbage at home instead of dumping all garbage to a single container and let the machines / people at the garbage processing plant do the sorting?The technology to do this has already been available for many years and is routinely used to do just that.
2021-11-15T04:15:06Z,2021-11-15T04:15:06Z,0,"This is a pretty interesting video,  this system would be pretty interesting to use within the Toronto / GTA area for sure.As a Canadian i can appreciate the annoyance of carrying your garbage bin to the street,  however i&#39;ve never met anyone who&#39;s carried those bins inside their homes, since they are wheeled bins and typically left outside.Because they have latches that prevent animals from getting in they can be left outside usually,  but clearly certain circumstances require them to be brought in.    Regarding  Raccoons,  its a general rule of thumb to:a) rinse your food containers / garbage to reduce attractiveness to animals.  (also since recycling and garbage pickups alternate per week, it prevents the trash from stinking up the bins and attracting fliesb) Never leave the bins or the blue boxes at the curb for pick up until the morning of pickup,  it prevents night time predators from spending all night figuring out how to get into your bin.c) When Panda&#39;s figure out how to open the latch to the garbage a fool proof method to keep it closed is to put something heavy on top of it, like a paver stone, OR drill a hole in the latch and put a padlock through it."

You&#39;ll easily pay over 50% of your income in taxes. My trash gets picked up every week and recycling every other week. Simply taking the trash out in the morning keeps bears and raccoons out of the trash but I bought a simple bear/raccoon proof attachment off of Amazon for $20 just in case...
2021-11-14T20:45:41Z,2021-11-14T20:45:41Z,5,I don&#39;t know if this would work in my city. Most people leave their trash on the tables that they eat at or just drop their trash on the ground wherever they are at. It doesn&#39;t matter to them that a trash can is two or three SUV lengths away. I think it is because these people want to inconvenience others that come after them.
2021-11-14T12:19:06Z,2021-11-14T12:31:09Z,727,"For someone who&#39;s been living his whole life in a country like Finland, that feels beyond absurd. Granted, I never lived in a big city and we don&#39;t have raccoons here. But in towns/cities, you don&#39;t have your own garbage bin. The neighborhood or the building you live in will have them and you don&#39;t have to worry about them. And there are dedicated recycling areas around the city.Another thing I&#39;d like to mention is that we get money when we return the bottles and cans back to the shops. 0.15‚Ç¨ from cans 0,10‚Ç¨/0,20‚Ç¨/0,40‚Ç¨ from bottles. That amount is already included in the product price, but we can get it back. There are machines in the shops that you put them in and it gives you a ticket that you can turn into money or use it to buy something. The bottles and cans are then recycled and reused. I&#39;m quite interested which other countries have this kind of a system in use? I know Sweden does at least."

Instead, we have these huge garbage containers outside which we throw our trash into. Kinda like in Amsterdam, except not underground and no recycling (even when there is a place for that, it&#39;s hard to say how much is actually recycled). Then these containers are emptied out every day or almost every day depending on the place. In the past we also had garbage chutes to which you had access on every floor of the building. You would basically throw your trash there and it would travel to the container. Now there are almost no places that have them working, but still. Plus we have this tradition that if you are throwing away some furniture or books you can just leave them outside the container and someone else might take them. Anyway, it was really interesting to learn how you take out your trash in other countries :) I never thought that it could be so different!"
2021-11-13T18:52:12Z,2021-11-13T18:52:12Z,0,"Oh yeah, they used this idea for parks in Abbotsford BC.It was utilized along with a few other scams as a work-around to bust the civil worker&#39;s unions.Rather than having several garbage cans throughout the parks, they have only one near the entrance and garbage and bags of dog waste tends not to make it into the bin. It gets to be a disgusting, stinking mess during the summer, especially when the underground bin is over full and it takes a week for the company to be scheduled to empty it with their very expensive crane service.After breaking these unions, the city now spends more for the same results given the amount of workers it takes now to both keep up the parks and the patrols of ticket writers plus the revenue influx for the initial conversion.Perhaps it works if you do it for the &#39;right reasons&#39; and you have the people buy-in first but I think the main difference here is the availability to the user so inconvenience does not become an issue."

Recycling is not common here and I have to drive to drop off my recyclables when they accumulate. But they don&#39;t accept foam, cans from canned food, or glass. For the glass I found a specific hardware store to bring it to where they make construction bricks out of crushed glass and cement. My main concern is what happens to the trash when they pick it up. I know there are landfills here but that&#39;s a crappy solution also. We need to reduce waste. Period."

In my eyes, one positive is that the size of the garbage bins that each household has, can be a legitimate deterrent to buying more stuff. I have heard my parents actually being up the point of having more garbage/recycling than could be put in the bin this week as a reason to not buy something. I doubt most people actually have this problem especially where it matters with trash since most people I know actually have this problem with recycling. Since our recycling system is so backed up and inefficient, there are indirect incentives to recycle less, like weirdly small recycling bins. A couple of years ago when I was spending my Christmas holiday in Houston, Texas, they actually stopped picking up recycling as a whole around that time since the amount of boxes from the holiday was so immense, they had to pause accepting any more recycling to have their facilities get through what they already had."

I imagine using public dumpsters causes people to dump all sorts of excess crap into them Oh but wait the clever Dutch made the bins really difficult to put anything larger than a small bag in the bin causing you to make trips every day.

2021-06-07T18:32:21Z,2021-06-07T18:32:21Z,0,&quot; We have no garbage day in AhMsterdam&quot; yes you do but because you do not have to deal with it you think there is none. You wish to know why recycling and garbage fails in America and Canada? Because we pay for it and the companies who provide the service are in it to make a profit and provide stocks. meanwhile in AHMsterdam you pay more taxes which provide for that service. A prime example of recyclables in California is you get this tiny fucking tub that barely holds 30 crushed aluminum cans and are expected to put ALL your recyclables into it the not to mention you are paying for this &quot;service&quot; with no kick back on the value of the recycled material. Putting giant &quot;kiosks&quot; fixed this somewhat then the cities that put out the kiosks got tired of homeless people breaking into their kiosks so they removed them...hmm who&#39;d think that the cities were making money off something people were giving them for free and then bitching about people who had no money &quot;stealing&quot; their free money. The problem comes down to American and Canadian cities being run by idiots who do not understand how to run a city properly and think of  garbage and a hinderance and not a service...unless it makes them free money to which they will go to any lengths to keep.

We had to buy a second garbage cart because of our volume, at $75 and wait a month to get it.  And woe betide if your lid is open even one inch; they refuse to take your garbage, leaving it to sit in the Florida sun and marinate another week.  After one hurricane a freezer&#39;s worth of food sat in the cart for 2 weeks and the stink was monumental.  And, you have to know which week is yard trash and which is household bulk trash, and if you get it wrong there it sits.  Unless of course you haul it back off the curb and store it.  Our so-called recycling is a joke.  They won&#39;t take glass, they don&#39;t want boxes broken down, and what they do take is baled and left sitting in a former landfill.  Before Waste Connections took over and we had to pay $175/yr for piss-poor service, we had twice a week pickup and MUCH better service.

2021-06-06T08:11:34Z,2021-06-06T08:11:34Z,1,"While I agree that this system offers an elegant solution to keep the streets free of the clutter of bins and bags full of smelly waste, there‚Äôs one thing you haven‚Äôt mentionned in your video: how is this paid for?Everywhere I‚Äôve lived, the cities imposed taxes for garbage collection. I‚Äôve seen different systems to finance this operation. Some cities impose quotas, where you pay a fixed amount per year and you‚Äôre either allowed a certain volume of bags per pickup (or one bin per household), or a limited number of pickups per year, or limited to a certain total weight of waste collected (bins have microchips and your waste is weighed on pickup). Anything exceeding the defined quota will result in a surcharge at the end of the year.Other cities have you pay proportionally for what you put out by having you put your waste in official bags which cost a ton (this is how the taxes are collected in this scenario). The more you sort, reuse and recycle, the less you‚Äôll need to pay. Throwing away household garbage in public bins is prohibited as those are not subject to any of these forms of control. You can be severely fined for bringing a bag out of your home and throwing it on the public bins intended for pedestrians to throw their chocolate wrappers and such.In a system where garbage bins are in public space and shared by everyone, how can you pinpoint and make responsible people who fail to sort their trash, or throw away excessive amounts of waste? What‚Äôs in place to reward people for reducing their household waste by recycling more or composting? There don‚Äôt seem to be any forms of control on any of that. I can only image a per-capita or per-household fixed tax to handle the overall costs of the operation divided evenly. I‚Äôm not convinced this system will help reduce overall waste or improve sorting or adopting ecological behaviour. It just takes the garbage out of sight, and no one can actually tell how good or bad the situation is, and no one needs to take responsibility for being trash at sorting trash."

You&#39;d have to lug kilos of rubbish to bins that would probably be 500 meters to a km away. We just don&#39;t live close enough together for this to be practical. Plus, because our blocks are bigger, we have lots of green rubbish (branches, leaves) which get composted along with your food. We have three bins: small red (for just rubbish: dirty nappies, unrecyclable plastics, stuff that can&#39;t be recycled nor composted), large yellow (for recycling; can&#39;t add soft plastics now though, need to go to your supermarket) and large green (composting food and plant materials).

2021-05-20T16:41:15Z,2021-05-20T16:41:15Z,43,"Heyo! Dutch sanitation worker here! I actually empty these for a living (though not in Amsterdam) here&#39;s a couple fun facts for those of you who are interested;- The containers for glass, packaging, paper, and textiles are usually grouped together in so-called &#39;recycling islands&#39; or &#39;recycling streets&#39;. These containers are emptied on a shedule like mentioned in the video. Ideally, the truck comes by when the container is just about full.-The &#39;waste&#39; containers (for non-recyclables) operate on a pay-per-click system, using a contactless household-bound smart card. The card opens the drum once, after which you can put a 60 or 30L bag in, and close it, which rotates the drum so the bag falls into the container.-The container registers this action as one &#39;click&#39; and it knows how many clicks it can take before it&#39;s full. Once it&#39;s at about 60%, it sends a signal to HQ and gets put on the route for the next day. -When the truck comes by to empty the waste containers, after putting it back into the ground, the worker will swipe a special badge over the container display, resetting the &#39;click counter&#39;.-Using this system, the trucks only head out to 60-100% full containers, maximizing efficiency, and in our case, one truck is enough to cover 90.000 inhabitants on a 5-day 8-hour shedule.-Containers can have many different mechanisms for lifting and discharging via truck-mounted crane! In the video, you see the so-called &quot;mushroom&quot; system, allowing the operator to empty the container and put it back into the pit, all without having to do ANY manual labor.-Waste containers only need a small solar cell to power the locking mechanism and the click counter!-Compactor containers like the one in the video are powered by a power supply that&#39;s mounted inside the pit. These containers have a screw compactor inside, and a laser tripwire that activates it when an x amount of bags have been dropped into the container!-Depending on the company, area, and circumstances, crane trucks can empty between 50 and 120 containers per day! Trucks are typically operated by one person, who drives the truck to the various locations, gets out, and empties the containers via remote-control truck-mounted crane.-Our trucks (like most in the business) have crane-mounted weighing systems, that can weigh a container in the air, once when full, and once when empty. This way, using geodata, the system knows which container we&#39;re loading based on our current location, and keeps track of the volume of each container when emptied. This data is then used to optimize routes, and move the emptying times backward or forward on the shedule as needed."

I&#39;m not sure what people do when they have houses, because not many people do in cities, and then in smaller towns or villages, I don&#39;t know what the schedule for bin pick-up is. But in cities, apartment buildings will have a certain amount of general waste and recycling bins, which the company who is in charge of cleaning the building will take out when needed. The bins are usually in a closed space, next to the garage if there&#39;s one, and if there isn&#39;t, they&#39;ll be in a designated space everyone in the building can access, and which is usually sheltered in some way. I have no idea what the schedule is in my city, but I know the bins are usually picked up quite late at night or early in the morning, to avoid being in everyone else&#39;s way, unlike in Australia, where they come around during the day, which also means the bins stay outside all day long, often all night long too, cause people take them out the night before, as per councils&#39; recommendations. I love watching the big communal bins being emptied, I find it facisnating to see the massive metal box coming out of the ground (the ones where I&#39;m from are a lot bigger than the ones you&#39;ve shown, which is why it&#39;s fascinating to me). And when they empty the glass one, oh boy do you know it! It&#39;s very loud.

Apartment buildings are the worst. people put 55&quot; tv&#39;s into the organic recycling bin which means it is now contaminated and becomes ordinary garbage. Nothing is separated and 80% of the tenants just drop their garbage down the garbage shoot so recycling is only about 1`0% and 90% ends up in landfills. I love low-income people in Toronto social housing. If it doesn&#39;t involve getting drunk, fighting about money for crack, or trading girls like hockey cards to earn money from prostitution they don&#39;t care! Proper garbage and recycling separation is not even a slight consideration for them. It&#39;s the cities problem, let them go through the garbage and separate it out."

To keep the animals out, I just keep a dog leash hooked over the lid, except at pickup time.  So far, no critters have ever gotten in.   Granted, this doesn&#39;t cover the several hours that the bins are roadside for pickup (as I have to remove the strap so the truck can robo-grab the bin and dump it), but that exposure is a tiny fraction of daylight hours and hasn&#39;t been an issue.EDIT: I might actually prefer having the sort of centralized pickup documented in the video, but I live in a rural area.

2020-11-21T04:28:14Z,2020-11-21T04:28:14Z,1,"I must say that there are huge differences in approach to garbage collection throughout NY state - even between communities only a few miles apart. The state is likely a microcosm of the world. My city (Syracuse NY) started an aggressive recycling program long before it was a household word but now with changes in the recycling market place (especially China no longer buying US recyclables) much more of our waste is going to local landfills. The local agency brags that 56% of our local waste is recycled so that gives me hope. In addition the non-recycled waste is burned in an emission controlled plant (heavily regulated) that produces enough electricity to power 30,000 homes. The burning reduces the amount of solid waste that goes to landfills by 90%. That&#39;s encouraging too but it&#39;s still not enough in my book. Many of us are familiar with the garbage chutes in large apartment buildings with no responsibility for the tenant to do anything but throw a bag down a chute. In some cities in NY the landlords are responsible to get the trash to the curb for a weekly public pickup and in others a private contractor must be hired. In most of the cities in NY, residential neighborhoods the trash/recycling pick up is weekly but the degree of recycling varies quite a bit. There is no law requiring recycling. It&#39;s not a surprise that NYC recycles less than 20% of its waste.In suburban areas outside of Syracuse there is very limited public trash pick up. A few villages provide the weekly service but most towns require you to hire a private contractor. Interestingly some municipalities in NY (including the city of Buffalo) require the use of residential garbage cans that can be picked up by a mechanical arm attached to the garbage truck. It is illegal for residents of NY to burn trash so even the rural towns have to figure it out and my guess is that the large portion of trash in NY outside of the cities is picked up by privately hired contractors."

2020-10-26T01:52:52Z,2020-10-26T02:00:37Z,0,Canada here. I have mostly recyclables but food scraps I put in a container and freeze in the freezer and then put in my compost when it gets full. I started doing that because the animals tear into any bag that smells like food. I even used heavy duty bags and doubled up and they still get in. If I do have a garbage bag that smells a bit I take it out in the morning before I leave for work so it&#39;s not outside all night for them to get to. The green bins are a joke no way i&#39;m leaving that rotten thing near the house. Also you have to buy bags extra for them screw that. Also here every week is recycling and you have to wait 2 weeks for garbage and green bin. Imagine 2 weeks in the summer with food rotting away in a green bin. Another problem with blue bins is when it gets windy garbage goes flying down the street. I see it all the time it makes one hell of a mess sometimes. The derelicts up the street don&#39;t follow any rules and have clear bags or put out car tires or whatever random shit they need out. I think too putting the food in the compost is much better anyways because it feeds the squirrels and trash pandas and skunks so they aren&#39;t so aggressive for the garbage bags. One time I went out there and I had 2 cats 2 trash pandas and a skunk all hanging out back there lol. I turned my flashlight on and said hey what&#39;s going on back here and they all looked at me lol. Meow!.

The bins in the Netherlands have wheels, are sturdy enough to keep pests out and can be used without a bag. On any day you can just throw your stuff in your bins and you roll them out on garbage day to pick them up later when you have the time.Being in control of your bins is just way better. These containers are overly full at times, causing piles to form around them. The lack of responsibility is just too detrimental. There are also cases of people throwing in burning material or a roaming cat in them requiring emergency services to be involved.And perhaps the biggest long-term issue is that sorting waste for recycling becomes way to inconvenient. I live in a place that uses these and if I want to separate plastic I&#39;d need a separate bag to carry it 4 streets to a container. And paper isn&#39;t even in such a system, likely because of the fire hazard it would pose. And you can&#39;t really empty out into these containers either, so you basically have to make lots of little trips or use bags for every kind of trash."

There are a lot of them, so that each &quot;bin shelter&quot; can serve multiple houses but not too many, so they don&#39;t overfill. No one cares about the garbage day either. And if the bin is full, you can always call the right city service and they will come and collect the trash. It all depends on the city tho.

If its card registered as stated somewhere above, I can see eventually the council charging by the pound of trash thats put in/ giving tax incentives for recycling and the lot to get people to go more zero waste. It wouldn&#39;t stop people from throwing their trash everywhere but if you had a &#39; litter picker&#39; registered card you could essentially work for the city in your spare time to earn side money by collecting recycling/ garbage and throwing it out.

I could, rather than waste plastic bags for my garbage, throw milk cartons and other bigger trash items right down the chute.The only downside was some noise on Thursdays when they were emptied (day time of course) and occasionally when people threw heavy stuff down the chutes which ended with a big bang at the bottom floor.One particular area even had a automated collection system in place, where each garbage bag thrown down the chute were conveyed via a screw underground to a central location where it was compacted into a container.On &quot;garbage day&quot;, the &quot;garbage truck&quot; (container truck) only needed to hook the container and replace it with an empty one.Of course, that system eventually broke down because people stupidly threw all kinds of junk down said chutes rather than just soft household garbage.But the tunnels are still there, waiting to be repaired. It was a super efficient system.They closed these down for some stupid reason, it was a near perfect system really.Nowadays, you have to go down to the bottom floor, all the way out to a building located at the parking lot and throw your garbage in open bins.That building smells of absolute ASS, it&#39;s locked with a keycard lock so you have to have that ready while also holding a bag of garbage.People throw their garbage RIGHT ON THE FLOOR because they don&#39;t want to enter the building seeing as how filthy and smelly it is. Opening the door from the inside makes you wanna wash your hands with sulfuric acid right away.Many times, people don&#39;t even open the door to the building but rather dump their garbage outside the door so seagulls and rats flock around said garbage until it&#39;s blown literally EVERYWHERE.AND, many people put their garbage bags outside their apartment doors in wait for the next time they are going to go to the building... So the whole access stairwell smells of garbage and discarded diapers.And of course it&#39;s a hazard.I disagree with your notion that these are any good. What&#39;s good is some way of dumping your garbage down a chute conveniently and then having all that garbage end up in a central location to be picked up by a simple container truck.Sure, it&#39;s more expensive that way but the convenience and efficiency is par none."

Honestly it seems like a convenience to me over this system which involves extra work because you can just collect garbage in a large receptacle instead of having to take individual garbage bags to these receptacles every time they get full.And that recycling one looks terrible. You have to feed in individual pieces of recycling through that small hole?

When the garbage truck comes, they just get the bins from there and empty them. While maybe not as efficient time wise for the garbage services, it solves the problem without having any visible trash cans on the street and since we don‚Äôt have raccoons in Germany, worst case it smells a bit strange. I actually prefer that greatly to glass, which is handled by big containers, I never bother to walk to, thus always having a collection of glass unter my sink, I really don‚Äôt need that for paper, recycling, trash and bio waste aswell. Of course if the houses don‚Äôt have any courtyards, this could be a useful solution."

Residents can drop off garbage and recycling anytime they like. It is quite relaxing not having to worry about anyone&#39;s mandated collection schedule."
2020-08-11T23:47:57Z,2020-08-11T23:47:57Z,3,These are cool. We have them in Sweden as well. Sweden even has garbage pipelines in some areas like central Stockholm. You throw garbage in a bin like these ones or one in your buildings staircase and a huge vacuum system transports it to the recycling station. No more trucks!
2020-08-08T03:08:17Z,2020-08-08T03:08:17Z,2,"I&#39;ve lived in two cities that are the absolute opposite of each other in terms of waste collection and management. In Guimar√£es, as in most of Portugal, you also have underground containers for each type of waste so you don&#39;t need to worry about garbage day; whereas in Salvador da Bahia, as in most of Brazil, not only is there no recycling of any kind (except for the odd local cooperative), but garbage trucks come by EVERY SINGLE DAY of the week and, in some neighbourhoods like mine, TWICE a day. That&#39;s because 1. residents will throw garbage out every day regardless, and 2. it&#39;s a very hot and humid place where organic waste will rot and smell in a matter of hours. But yeah, it&#39;s 2020 and garbage here still goes to landfills."
2020-08-06T00:39:11Z,2020-08-06T00:39:11Z,1,"My mum&#39;s home town used to have underground containers, but recently the municipal government decided to get rid of them and have a green bin and an &quot;other waste&quot; bin (glass is still collected in underground containers, and paper is also collected separately, though how depends on where exactly you live in the municipality, but the plastic, metal, and coated drink packages, which used to be collected separately, now need to go in the &quot;other waste&quot; bin); it&#39;s less convenient, totally negates infrastructure that was already present, and decreases the amount of garbage separation for recycling, and it&#39;s just so ridiculous."
2020-08-04T20:29:26Z,2020-08-04T20:29:26Z,4,"In Zaragoza, Spain, there a part of the city that not only there are no containers, all trash is connected and moved in a vacuum system to the recycling area:"
2020-08-03T13:03:16Z,2020-08-03T13:03:16Z,0,"Sorry to say, but Amsterdam isn&#39;t particularly advanced. It&#39;s Toronto and the other cities you mentioned that are a bit retarded.In Barcelona, they use smart-technologies to map the garbage network and alert the city garbage collection unit when trash collectors are full. The result is that garbage trucks only come when necessary, it saves energy, time, money and you don&#39;t have to pay attention to a weird garbage calendar or be afraid of raccoons.In Switzerland, we use the same kind of garbage bins / compactors than showed in the video at 1:15, except those are installed everywhere, not only in major cities. Even in the small mountain villages you don&#39;t have garbage days. In addition, we recycle a lot and have access to battery, glass, paper, compost and aluminium in every supermarket, in recycling centers and even sometimes at home.Oh and btw, the Russian pencil story is complete bullshit. The graphite that compose pencils would create shortcuts and respiratory problems for the astronauts in a zero gravity configuration. Pencils were never used in space and the pressurized cartridges invented by Fisher were easily reproducible by Russians."
2020-08-02T04:35:12Z,2020-08-02T04:35:12Z,1,Not only this - (in Canada) I&#39;ve noticed a ton of plastic trash that gets spilled and left in gutters after the trucks come through to pick up the recycling bins... this is not a sustainable solution.
2020-08-01T17:08:05Z,2020-08-01T17:08:27Z,1,"That&#39;s one thing that I miss from growing up in a small town with a local dump, now that I live in a small city with curbside garbage pickup: there was a lot LESS litter in the town where you had to bring your own trash to the dump. This isn&#39;t due to any &quot;moral impetus&quot; that the locals understand better or worse than anywhere else. It&#39;s because the night before trash day, and the morning of, is almost invariably windy, and the wind blows the recycling out of its bins and all down the sidewalk. Anything that&#39;s not blown out by the wind, might fall off the bin, or off an overloaded truck, when the garbage collector tries to dump your garbage into their truck, and is then left on the ground for you to pick up, or for the wind to blow away. There are all kinds of bottles, cans, and boxes in the woods beside and behind my house, which have blown down from my neighbors on trash day, and the pathway and bushes near my old apartment were FULL of letters and cups from the entire length of the street."
2020-07-29T21:05:17Z,2020-07-29T21:05:17Z,4,In Spain we have underground and not underground communitary trash bins for recycling that are emptied every day

The other bins are collected on a two week cycle.  Blue bins are for recycling, green bins are other waste, and brown bins for garden (what you call &#39;yard&#39;) waste."
2020-07-27T11:11:28Z,2020-07-27T11:11:28Z,1,"Here in India we have private waste collectors! We segregate the waste in two bins ( dry and wet waste ) and the collectors pick them up every day for a very small fee.  Other than that, items like cardboard boxes to newspapers to plastics are picked up by small time commercial recyclers who pay you for recycling."
2020-06-24T12:36:22Z,2020-06-24T12:36:22Z,0,"It&#39;s very nice that you introduce this concept to countries other than the Netherlands, but there are some very major drawbacks you fail to mention. 1. Kids have been known to mess about and get trapped in these. 2. There is such a thing as garbage day (when they come to empty them), and in some places you do end up worrying about them, because the containers fill up FAST. In my experience, they often fill up leading up to trash day and subsequently trash accumulates outside of the containers. So there is still garbage on the streets. In the Hague, they don&#39;t get emptied often enough, so we deal with flocks of seagulls ripping trash bags apart. 3. The containers system doesn&#39;t allow for the disposal of any oddly shaped garbage. If it doesn&#39;t fit in the little mouth section, you end up having to cut/break your trash apart. Any oddly shaped stuff usually ends up being stacked against the disposal unit. Again, trash accumulates on the streets. 4. The Netherlands doesn&#39;t have raccoons. It solves an issue we don&#39;t deal with. The containers do keep the sidewalks clear of big bins. That&#39;s a big plus. However, when it fails, the trash bags accumulating on the street are easy pickings for the pests that we DO have (Birds and rats)5. The rotating mechanism has a tendency to fail. If gunk gets into the system (which it will, because its a trash disposal unit) or if enough people try to stuff their oddly shaped trash into the unit, it can get stuck. This means the lid no longer opens or closes. If that happens, NOBODY can use the unit anymore, and trash simply accumulates again. I&#39;m not saying that the alternatives for densely populated cities are much better, but there is a good reason why the majority of the Netherlands outside of densely populated areas uses bins. The containers are good because they trap the smell of waste and make it so there aren&#39;t large stacks of bags or rows of bins out on the small city streets. They also encourage the recycling. But they are not aimed controlling pests. If anything, they allow for pests to thrive."
2020-06-20T13:48:51Z,2020-06-20T13:48:51Z,1,the recycling bins are everywhere but the ones you can throw all your garbage in are usually only in big citiesin the north where the cities are smaller there stil is a garbage day

Trash (rest afval) is collected in underground bins.But Paper, Plastic and Greens are still in containers that need to be put out every week.Where I lived before it was all underground bins, but these can have problems. Half the time the Trash bin wouldn&#39;t work properly, as the card reader was dodgy. These card readers are needed, because people from other areas/towns would drive with their garbage to throw it away in our bins :| But not just the cardreaders were dodgy, the mechanism for these bins tended to brake quite often, jamming it shut. And as the recycle bins weren&#39;t as frequent as the trash ones....almost noone used them.Now that I have large containers at this new house, recycling is easier and so I have started doing it more."

I live in a smaller town in the Netherlands just south of Haarlem. We still have trash day for both GREEN and NORMAL trash, but we have those underground things for recycling. But I&#39;ve never had our trash bin knocked over by any trash panda. Worst case scenario my own stupid dog wants to eat out of it."

Additionally, since this year the foodwaste bins have chips in them to track the amount of trash per household, to better allocate resources."
2019-12-30T09:41:45Z,2019-12-30T09:41:45Z,509,"This is not quite as universal as you make it sound üôÇ. These underground trash bins are used in denser neighborhoods, inner cities and for midrise appartment blocks and highrise flats. They can often be card-locked for use by the residents only.The underground recycling bins for glass, paper and plastic (and sometimes for other things like metals or old clothes and shoes) are universal; they are placed in every neighborhood and near neighborhood stores and around shopping centers, for use by everyone.The lower-density neighborhoods (as in suburbs and smaller towns) do tend to have the large plastic rolling bins of different colours for trash and recycling, that are picked up on an elaborate schedule in alternating weeks - everyone has a gray one for trash and a green or brown one for composting waste, then most municipalities have a third colour (blue, or gray with orange lids, or whatever)  for a third type that differs by municipality: I have an orange-lid one for plastics, my father in a different town has a blue one for paper. His plastics get collected in plastic bags once every fortnight, our more windy town stopped doing that as the wind made a mess of those bags, so they switched to the third container. Our paper still gets picked up by volunteers for the sports clubs and churches, who get paid for the volume they collect. In dad&#39;s town they didn&#39;t consider that economically sensible, and the municipality collects the paper trash in the blue household bins.But even in areas with separate household recycling bins you&#39;ll find the underground recycling bins, at the least near the neighborhood store (but often in more locations), for people who don&#39;t want to collect all these separate fractions at home for two weeks, and don&#39;t mind walking 50 meters to dispose of it, or taking the empties back when they go to the shop."
