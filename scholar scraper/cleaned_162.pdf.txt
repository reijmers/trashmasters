chain Food loss and waste management Sustainability Sustainable consumption and production a b s t r a c t The global agrifood sector is in a dire need of transitioning into sustainable consumption and produc tion patterns The circular economy concept offers a viable pathway to improve resource eciency and recover value from food loss and waste Although China has made circular economy a strategic compo nent of its national development strategy it has faced multiple barriers which persisted in the fullscale implementation of sustainable food consumption and production We aimed to empirically investigate these barriers based on data from three key stakeholder groups in the food supply chains the food processors sales and distribution rms and consumers We quantied the causeandeffect relationships among barriers by the fuzzy decision makingtrial and evaluation laboratory analysis Fuzzy DEMATEL technique All groups identify weak enforcement of environmental regulations and lack of environmental education and accountability as key cause barriers in China Our results suggest that policy level changes include enhanced regulatory attention and new educational initiatives will be required in China Man agers should focus on waste separation and gaining economies of scale Together these initiatives will help promote sustainable consumption and production for a paradigm shift to a circular agrifood supply chain system Institution of Chemical Engineers Published by Elsevier BV All rights reserved Introduction To ensure sustainable consumption and production SCP pat terns is one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations Sustainable consumption and production is about doing more and better with less It is also about decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation increasing re source eciency and promoting sustainable lifestyles United Na tions The food sector has been one of the focus areas for making the transition to SCP patterns because the sector is respon sible for about energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the world United Nations According to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO about onethird of the food produced for human consumption approximately bil lion tons worth around trillion is lost or wasted in food pro duction and harvesting salesdistribution and consumption stages Corresponding author Email address nkliuypnankaieducn Y Liu every year FAO On the one hand the world needs to re duce food loss and waste along the supply chain to meet the in creasing consumption needs of a growing population Partt et al Toop et al On the other hand the current food waste management systems need an overhaul to maximize value recov ery Taking multiple European countries as an example food waste accounts for about of the total municipal biowaste which is collected separately and treated by composting or anaerobic diges tion with biogas production European Environment Agency However the rate of separated biowaste collection averaged about only in and the remaining biowaste was not sepa rated from other municipal waste and thus lost for value recov ery European Environment Agency In many other coun tries including China food waste recycling is much less developed and food waste is often disposed of together with other municipal waste and sent to landlls The circular economy CE concept can support systemic changes required to increase implementation of SCP measures and recover value from valuable food waste resources In recent years  Institution of Chemical Engineers Published by Elsevier BV All rights reserved Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption CE has been increasingly recognized as a more sustainable alterna tive to the dominant linear ie take make and dispose economic model Ghisellini et al which offers a new and compelling sustainability perspective Farooque et al a CE nds its root in the concepts of industrial ecology biomimicry and cradle tocradle Yuan et al McDonough and Braungart Mentink It is an innovative industrial ecosystem that is restorative and regenerative by design Ellen MacArthur Founda tion In CE technical materials eg metal and plastics are designed for recovery remanufacturing refurbishing and recy cling and biological materials eg fruit peels and chicken bones are safely returned to the biosphere to enhance natural capital By circulating the use of materials CE aims to improve resource e ciency with virtually no creation of waste Ellen MacArthur Foun dation in a way that will reduce costs of both resources and energy as we shift towards SCP Broadbent In a fully circu lar economy forward supply chain operations recycling activities and value recovery from waste are powered by renewable energies so that materials circularity is achieved without creating negative environmental footprint Such a vision although far from being a reality inspires the world to move in the right direction Policymakers and business leaders worldwide have started to embrace CE as an innovative and more sustainable economic model Several major economies including the European Union China and Japan have made CE part of their regionalnational de velopment strategy Organizations including Apple Philips Coca Cola and IKEA are committed to CE to enhance their sustainability performance to create value for their customers and other stake holders In the agrifood sector taking the UK as an example it could save annual landll cost by USD billion if organic food wastes were kept out of landlls Other benets include a reduc tion of greenhouse gas emissions by million tonnes each year electricity generation of up to GWh each year through waste toelectricity technologies and organic compost to restore soil fer tility Ellen MacArthur Foundation The world is in a dire need to ght environmental degradation and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change Therefore it is of strategic importance to implement CE principles in food waste management Despite these potential benets to SCP in the agrifood sec tor it is not clear how progress can be made in developing and embedding CE principles into the industry due to the presence of multiple barriers These sustainability barriers are often inter twined so it is dicult to divide and address them sequentially Han et al Jurgilevich et al Ghisellini et al In addition studies of food waste management have mainly focused on the consumption stage Schanes et al Similarly stud ies of barriers to sustainable food waste management have also fo cused on the consumption stage for example do Carmo Stangher lin and de Barcellos and Lazell Although substan tial environmental impacts from food loss and waste also occur in the food processing and salesdistribution stages United Na tions no study has systematically investigated sustainability barriers in these stages along with those in the consumption stage in the context of China It has been widely acknowledged that sup ply chains should be studied as systems as a supply chain players behavior and performance are inuenced by those of other players which is evidential in the bullwhip effect Lee et al SCP re quire collaboration and close coordination among multiple supply chain actors Borrello et al Therefore it is essential to em ploy a systems approach to investigate its implementation barriers Our results narrow the knowledge gap by investigating barriers across multiple stakeholders in the forward supply chain includ ing food processors salesdistribution channels and consumers It provides a more holistic and systematic view to help overcome the barriers to sustainable food consumption and production from a CE perspective focusing on value recovery from food loss and waste In contrast to earlier works which tended to study challenges as isolated ones at the consumption stage this research investigates sustainability barriers in the context of the larger supply chain system in which an actor is embedded in Applying such systems thinking can help uncover the interdependency among system ac tors and provide deeper understanding in the root causes of com plex problems Therefore it can better predict behaviors and ulti mately adjust their outcomes Richmond Given that waste disposal behaviors vary in different cultures there is a need to study barriers in specic regional and cultural settings to take into account the effect of regionscultures The context of this study is China the largest developing coun try that has both great need and commitment to implement CE The insights offered from the research are not only applicable to agrifood businesses and their supply chain operations in China but also shed light on similar operations in many other economies that struggle with a transition to sustainable food consumption and production The research addresses the following research ques tions What are the key barriers hindering sustainable food consump tion and production for transitioning to a CE in China How can the interdependency between the barriers be uncov ered for identifying and overcoming the root cause barriers This research answers the rst question by identifying a list of important barriers based on literature and insights from the Chinese agrifood sector The multiple barriers inuence decision makers and suggest that a multicriteria decisionmaking model MCDM would be valuable elikbilek and Tysz It ad dresses the second question by utilizing the Fuzzy decisionmaking trial and evaluation laboratory technique Fuzzy DEMATEL to systematically analyze the complicated interdependency between barriers Fuzzy DEMATEL is a fuzzy set extension to the stan dard DEMATEL technique Gabus and Fontela In compar ison with standard DEMATEL Fuzzy DEMATEL is more advanta geous because it can address the inherent vagueness bias and un certainty in human judgments which are part of the concerned re search phenomenon Wu and Lee Lin Its method ological procedures are similar to greybased DEMATEL another widely used variation to the standard DEMATEL Si et al We used Fuzzy DEMATEL because it has greater capacity than greybased DEMATEL in handling vagueness Fuzzy DEMATEL uses threedimensional triangular fuzzy numbers TFNs eg Kumar et al while greybased DEMATEL uses two dimensional grey numbers eg to represent the linguistic variables Based on the ndings from the Fuzzy DEMATEL analysis we discuss managerial and policy implications on how the barriers can be addressed The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section re views relevant literature Section describes the methodology and data collection procedure Section presents the results and analysis Section discusses managerial and policy implications Section concludes the research Literature review Food waste management and sustainable consumption and production The United Nations Environmental Program UNEP de nes SCP as the use of services and related products which re spond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while min imizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of fu ture generations FAO denes food losses as the decrease Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption in edible food mass throughout the part of the supply chain that specically leads to edible food for human consumption p which take place at production postharvest and processing stages in the food supply chain Food waste is dened as food losses oc curring at the end of the food chain retail and nal consump tion p Food loss and waste reduction is the major global economic and political agenda as one third of globally produced food is lost or wasted in the food chain Corrado et al This is especially becoming imperative amidst the call for explor ing the connection between food waste generation and waste man agement under the broader framework of sustainable production and consumption Lehtokunnas et al In the food systems SCP face many issues due to complex interdependency in a web of political institutional and technological factors Heller and Ke oleian Papargyropoulou et al It is also closely linked to their value chain governance patterns Messner et al It is also imperative to recognize the food categories with high envi ronmental intensity Beretta and Hellweg Some of the other unique challenges that food supply chains face include frequent production setups strict regulations perishability storage condi tion requirements transport damages processing loss contamina tion and recycling issues AlAnsari et al Behzadi et al Sonesson et al Matzembacher et al These challenges are further escalated by widespread growth and struc tural shift in the food consumption pattern of urban and ru ral consumers and more challenge is to have the conceptual un derstanding on the nature of food wastes and their treatment Dobermann and Nelson Matzembacher et al Hence there is a growing need to theorize sustainable food supply chains Sala et al Zhu et al Matzembacher et al Food waste management is one of the key challenges in sus tainable food consumption and production GarciaHerrero et al As mentioned earlier food loss and waste account for about onethird of the global food production equal to billion tons per year A few studies reported the magnitude of food losses and wastes in the production and consumption stages with respect to developed and developing countries Smil Partt et al Gustavsson et al Their causes are diverse Buzby and Hyman Girotto et al Luo et al Some prod uct wastes are not suitable for consumption they need to undergo reprocessing for value recovery Sonnino and McWilliam Some even pose environmental threats and hygiene problems Gustavsson et al Besides it is dicult to track or separate the costs from the perspective of organization that generates the waste Eriksson et al In the meantime new technologies eg Industry and enhanced collaboration may support rms to address these threats and recover more value Rosa et al Lately literature shows interest in developing strategies to manage those products wastes effectively as they are recognized as an alternative way to food supply Stancu et al However the available studies appear to be biased towards the quantication of wastes and losses by projecting them as a negative phenomenon Eriksson et al Amidst this researchers demand the need for fresh perspectives of food waste generation studies from multi stakeholder perspectives Corrodo et al In China alone the annual food waste is in the range of billion Chinese Renminbi RMB Chen et al The loss of grains or liangshi in Chinese in the entire supply chain is about with the consumption stage being the single largest source of food waste The estimated loss in storage pro cessing and distribution is and respectively This level of waste is equivalent to about billion m of water foot print and about million hectares of land being cultivated in vain Liu et al Besides the postharvest stage contributes around million tons wastage in storage mainly due to fungi ro dents and insects Zhao and Huang SAG and NDRC Liu et al Additionally there are some signicant process ing transportation and distribution losses in the system Liu and Bai CE oriented food loss and waste management The CE concept offers a new perspective to sustainable food loss and waste management as it considers wastes as resources for value recovery Cicatiello et al As mentioned earlier di verting organic food wastes from landlls could generate tremen dous economic and environmental benets Ellen MacArthur Foun dation In a recent study Santagata et al summa rize the challenges and opportunities of food waste recovery in CE The research on food value chain primarily on the produc tion business and industry trends The focus on transition to wards a circular economy is topical on food value chain and waste literature till recently the focus has been mostly on consumers Lehtokunnas et al At the policy level it is the part of FarmtoFork strategy proposed by the circular economy package as a part of global initiative Corrado et al However such a mission requires a systems approach because food loss and waste occur at multiple stages along the supply chain including agricul tural production postharvest handling and storage processing dis tribution and consumption Liu The multiple subsystems and components mean that integrated decision making is crucial Lechner and Reimann Jabbour et al Therefore CE oriented food loss and waste management requires close coordina tion of supply chain actors including farmers bread producers re tailers compostable manufacturers insect breeders livestock farm ers and consumers Borrello et al Its rst step is to collect and sort a large variety of food wastes eciently from spatially dispersed sources Afterwards food wastes are treated by appro priate value recovery options Efforts should be made by managers to reduce resource use and waste by carefully assessing supplier capabilities and their supply network to ensure waste is not only avoided at their facilities but also at other facilities along the sup ply chain Bai et al Throughout these effort s there remain challenges for rms that wish to transition to a protable CE busi ness model with many barriers eg customer behavior or nan cial limitations and constraints that are outside of the manage rial control Loon and Wassenhove In a study de Sadeleer et al analyzed the performance of transition into CE and waste prevention through recycling and energy recovery Barriers to CE implementation in China Despite of a promising vision CE implementation faces a vari ety of barriers Govindan and Hasanagic Tura et al and De Jesus and Mendona provided general classications of CE implementation barriers Given that CE implementation bar riers are context specic most barrier studies focused on a specic regioncountry For example Kirchherr et al investigated barriers in the European Union and Mont et al focused on the Sweden context This subsection reviews barriers to CE imple mentation in China which is the context of this study CE implementation in China has been driven by government agencies such as the National Development Reform Commission NDRC and Ministry of Environmental Protection Mathews and Tan Geng et al However Chinas progress in CE im plementation has been modest due to the persistence of many bar riers Mathews and Tan Pesce et al Further Su et al analyzed CE implementation barriers including lack of in centive schemes for CE projects absence of highend technology towards CE practices complex institutional structures and issues of local administration coordination less nancing options lack of transparency and absence of regionwise customized performance Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption monitoring system Ranta et al discussed barriers includ ing the absence of a holistic vision overemphasis on recycling and underuse of reuse and reduce methods From institutional per spectives Liu and Bai recognized a gap between awareness about CE practices and its implementation due to structural con textual and cultural issues These issues are unique to organiza tions and regions Gedam et al Yuan identied that inadequate regulatory environment multiple stakeholder involvement absence of basic data and low level of attention to waste management caused obstruct the CE projects in a signicant way This also appears to be a major issue of production and consumption stages In a recent study Zhang et al reported that the key barriers to smart waste management for a CE in China were the lack of regulatory pres sures and the lack of environmental education and culture of envi ronmental protection Focusing on the holistic supply chain man agement Farooque et al b identied the key barriers to cir cular food supply chains in China were weak environmental reg ulations and enforcement Lack of market preferencepressure and Lack of collaborationsupport from supply chain actors Ex tending this insight Ranta et al elucidated and compared the institutional barriers of CE economy in China the US and Eu rope The study recognized the difference of the normative be haviour of the Chinese environment than other regions and at tribute CE performance in China to its large informal sector and lowlevel regulation with less enforcement On the other hand it argued that the US lacks nationwide stringent regulation support ing CE and Europe supports CE with high level sourceseparation activities and clear institutional environment In a specic study with respect to Norway Jaegar and Upadhyay identied product design and production and high startup costs are key bar riers to CE environments In Sweden the CE activities show less incentive alignment and lack prot focus Eriksson et al Johansson and Henriksson In addition complexity of pro cedures and high legalregulatory compliance costs appear to be the signicant barriers in Europe GarcaQuevedo et al On other hand China considers recyclables as valuables instead of waste yet their regionspecic CE norms appear to be a potential barrier to CE implementation Weak legal enforcement Farooque et al b in China has continued Despite rapid economic expansion the deteriorating en vironment has undermined the local standard of living Chinas En vironmental Protection Law was updated in including stricter punishments on polluters Related initiatives have yielded signi cant results especially in air water and soil pollution However food loss and waste is not a heavy polluting sector so it has been excluded from the environmental protection related laws Similarly while Chinas Circular Economy Promotion Law was amended in there are no provisions on food loss and waste While food loss and waste reduction can contribute to the carbon emission food sector was not included in Chinas carbon neutrality strategy The most related law is the Antifood Waste Law issued in April intended to enhance food security However many citizens are not aware of the newly enacted law the nes are not high and the measurements are not clear suggesting there will be weak en forcement Agrifood products face unique challenges for transitioning to a CE Leite et al Overall the food recycling system in China is weak due to poor infrastructure for collection and in adequate treatment facilities Unsorted food wastes are mainly sent to landlls Only in large cities like Shanghai and Beijing a small portion of food waste is separated at sources and treated by biochemical processes Thi et al In recent years in terest in food waste recycling has been growing Wen et al Zhang et al advocated the use of waste cooking oil as an energy resource Converting food waste to energy is in line with the interest of the government to reduce the demand for petroleum products and natural gas Liang and Zhang Li et al Woon and Lo proposed the use of gen eral food wastes as a potential resource for generating electricity and city gas in Hong Kong Some agrifood wastes such as potato vines peanut shells wild plants and household wastes are con verted into useful products such as biomass biodiesel and ani mal and sh feed as they are nutrientrich with organic matter Ma et al Chen et al All these studies on food waste recycling focused on technologies and practices They offer little insights into the related implementation barriers which are cru cial for understanding why they not been commercialized in the domestic market Theoretical background The research draws on the combined perspectives of stake holder theory and theory of reasoned actions TRA at the rm level to explore the challenges of food waste management The stakeholder theory underscores the responsibility of fullling both internal and external participants expectations Freeman In the current context it helps explain the reasons for barriers to sustainable food consumption and production that involve ac tors or stakeholders of varied characteristics and behaviors such as processors wholesalers traders distribution channel partners e retailers and consumers The theory offers deliberations on multi stakeholder engagement and governance that are imperative to the food processing industry and contribute to designing and co creation processes in ensuing sustainability across food chains Schrder et al Besides it provides normative explanations of why and what ways rms should consider stakeholder views in implementing sustainable and productionconsumption strategies The theory also supports incorporating the stakeholders views for visioning and participatory exercises that lead to decision mak ing within the CE and waste management system Vergragt and Quist The power of TRA is betting to explain the rms readiness for adopting CE principles in waste management Fishbein and Ajzen The theory helps to nd out the reasons of behavioural attitudes of stakeholders towards particular phe nomenon as it is recognized as the moral responsibility of stake holders Sayer Lehtokunna et al TRA helps to under stand the individual actions and consumption patterns to design policy and promote the sustainable waste management practices integrating CE elements Specically it helps to explore the atti tude under the conditions of volitional control and predicts the intentions which explicates willingness or readiness to engage a specic task in environmental sustainability Han and Kim Besides it decodes interactions between barriers of SCP focus ing on inter and intra organizational subjective norms which is about the specic behavior under external stakeholders pressure Fishbein and Ajzen Thus it is helpful to study the com mitment and readiness to CE through the tting production and consumption processes Barrier study techniques In complex environments effective decisionmaking is highly dependent on the analysis of interdependency between the deci sion variables interacting within the system The DEMATEL tech nique Gabus and Fontela has become increasingly popular in analyzing those interactions Shao et al Other relevant multicriteria decisionmaking tools include Interpretive Structural Modelling ISM Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP Analytic Net work Process ANP and Structural Equation Modelling SEM Re fer Table Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption Table A comparison of DEMATEL with ISMAHPANPSEM DEMATEL ISM AHP ANP SEM DEMATEL uncovers the causal interactions among the variables classifying them into cause and effect groups ISM uncovers the contextual interactions among variables based on their driving potential and dependencies AHP does not reveal interdependencies between and among the variables ANP uncovers interdependencies between and among the variables It is less accepted for barrier studies due to its complexity SEM is mainly used for theoretical development and it requires a large sample size Source Adopted from Venkatesh et al and Mangla et al The DEMATEL technique not only establish relationships but also elucidate the overall degree of inuence of the study factors Gabus and Fontela Centered on graph theory the tech nique can accommodate heterogeneous factors Li and Wan Benyoucef et al and does not require a large amount of data It visualizes the causal relationships through the impactrelations map or causaleffect diagram where the techniques differentiate causal and effect groups separately Venkatesh et al The DEMATEL technique was judged to be most suitable to address the research questions proposed earlier because it is a good t for uncovering the causal relationships between system variables He et al As mentioned earlier we employed Fuzzy DE MATEL an advanced variant of the standard DEMATEL technique to address the inherent vagueness bias and uncertainty in human judgments Wu and Lee Lin There is a wide range of research reports that applied fuzzy logic studies with DEMATEL Keskin Some of the recent DEMATEL studies in the sustain able production consumption domain include Deng et al Sivakumar et al Bhatia and Srivastava Kumar and Dixit Liu et al Singhal et al etc Summarizing the literature review food waste management is a key challenge in SCP The CE concept offers a viable pathway to sustainable food consumption and production by treating wastes as resources for value recovery A wide range of barriers to CE imple mentation have been identied in the extant literature but there is a lack of study of specic barriers in food waste management in China This signicant knowledge gap will be addressed in the fol lowing sections Besides DEMATEL technique has not been widely applied in the CE studies although it has been widely used and reported in closedloop or conventional reverse supply chain and energy studies in recent times Bykzkan and Gleryz elikbilek and Tysz Methodology The study follows a twostep process The rst step is to elu cidate the barrier list In the second step these barriers are sub jected to fuzzy DEMATEL technique in the following step to draw causaleffect maps The following subsections describe the meth ods in detail Finalizing the study barriers Based on the recent literature the researchers compiled a list of thirteen barriers to sustainable food consumption and produc tion in China with a focus on value recovery from wastes from a CE perspective The list was reviewed by three senior govern ment ocials who were in charge of municipal waste manage ment and new government initiatives in sustainability four busi ness managers who had responsibilities over supply chain opera tions in food processors and retailers and two scholars in the eld with indepth knowledge of the agrifood sector in China They were asked to comment on the validity of the barriers in the Chi nese context and whether any important barrier is missed out A concern was raised that practitioners may have diculty to distin guish several barriers in the initial list because they were regarded as too closely related to each other Based on their feedback the thirteen barriers were merged into nine barriers that are distinc tively different from each other For example low margin in value recovery from food waste was considered as intertwined with high collection and transportation cost and therefore they were com bined as cost barrier According to their suggestion a new barrier was added into the list which was lack of benchmarking and rel evant standards in China The resulting nal list of ten barriers is described as follows B Weak legal enforcement Like many other developing countries China lacks a comprehensive and effective legal sys tem for environmental protection and the enforcement of laws is weak Borrello et al Govindan and Hasanagic Li and Yu Despite Chinas ambitious CE vision and current environ mental laws the implementation end enforcement has faced many diculties which are intertwined with resource implications mon itoring mechanisms and potential impacts on business operations and economic development B Inadequate infrastructure Waste sorting at source is a precondition for maximizing value recovery from food waste Wang et al Unfortunately most Chinese cities do not have adequate infrastructure to support refuse classication In July Shanghai the largest city in China started to implement compulsory waste sorting However it is lagging in food waste processing capacities Overall there is not enough separated bins for diverse types of garbage and the waste management system is weak in China Zhang and Wen especially in its less devel oped regions B Behavioural barrier Most Chinese do not have the habit of rubbish sorting due to various cultural and historical reasons They are used to mixing all garbage types and throwing them away altogether for convenience Liu et al In addition it is part of the traditional Chinese culture for a host to prepareorder more than enough foods which is perceived as a symbol of prosperity Many Chinese hosts feel embarrassed if their guests nish all the served foods because they feel losing face if their guests do not get enough to eat Therefore food waste is commonplace at social events in China B L a c k of investment in advanced equipmenttechnologies Value recovery from food loss and waste requires signicant up front investment in advanced equipmenttechnologies Lack of nancial resources is widely acknowledged as a barrier to support CE implementation Govindan and Hasanagic In China food processors and municipal waste management departments often employ contractors to manage waste collection and further pro cessing activities Such contractors are often small and medium sized enterprises which do not have a lot of nancial resources to invest in advanced food waste processing equipmenttechnologies B Lack of expertise CE is a relatively new concept so there is a lack of expertise to support its implementation Kaur et al Borrello et al Food waste as a biobased resource requires specialized competence and knowledge for value recovery opera Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption Table Evaluator demographics Evaluator Group Frequency Percentage Annual Revenue million RMB Food Processor Sales distribution channel Supermarket Importer and Exporter Eretailer Wholesaler Consumer Total Table Evaluator proles Evaluator Group Industry Experiences years Designation Middle Level Manager OwnerSenior Manager Food Processor Supermarket Importer and Exporter Eretailer Wholesaler Consumer tions At present there are very limited training courses and study programs in China on CE and sustainable food waste management Consequently there is a shortage of expertise for a variety of so phisticated food waste treatment options B Lack of crosssector collaboration Lack of sup portcollaboration from other sectors can be a serious obstacle to a transition to CE Mangla et al because it is often not realistic for a same sector to reuse all its wastes For example some food wastes can be used to produce animal feeds com post or energy but they require substantial initial investments and longterm crosssector collaboration between food waste producerscollectors and potential users to be economically vi able Unsurprisingly lack of crosssector collaboration is a barrier which hinders the implementation of CE principles in food waste management B Cost barrier There is a low margin in value recovery from food wastes and a high cost for food waste collection and trans portation Borrello et al Govindan and Hasanagic Therefore food waste management is not necessarily protable depending on whether the operating costs can be fully offset by the economic gains or not Due to cost considerations a waste management business may not want to take certain types of food wastes which have lower economic benets Apparently there ex ists a cost barrier to achieving maximum environmental benets by collecting and processing all food wastes B Lack of economies of scale There is a lack of the economies of scale in collecting and processing food wastes for value recovery Borrello et al Govindan and Hasanagic Sauv et al especially for household food wastes Household food waste is spatially dispersed and the amount collectable from each residential community is usually not much Such a lack of economies of scale disincentivizes sustainable food waste management for value recovery B Lack of environmental education and accountability In the past few decades there was very limited education on envi ronmental protection in China Consequently many Chinese citi zens have little care or awareness about the environmental im pacts of food loss and waste Geng et al In recent years the Chinese government stepped up environmental education but the effect of the old mindset is persistent especially among the older generations The current environmental education system fo cuses more on professional education and relatively ignores the nonprofessional education that would inuence daytoday con sumption and businessoriented behavior relating to food wastes Tian and Wang In addition there is often a lack of account ability for environmental damages except for major environmental disasters B Lack of benchmarking and standards There are dicul ties in nding benchmarking enterprises or practices for sustain able food loss and waste management as Chinas progress toward a CE is still modest Mathews and Tan There is also a lack of national and industry standards for collecting and processing food wastes Overall food waste management as a sector is still at an early stage of adopting sustainability practices in China The researchers designed a questionnaire in English to cap ture the opinions of evaluators for Fuzzy DEMATEL analysis The questionnaire was then translated into the Chinese language in cluding an explanation of each barrier to guide the evaluators Two researchers who are bilingual in English and Chinese checked the translation to ensure accuracy The researchers conducted two rounds of pilot tests with nine expert evaluators to get feedback on the questionnaire design Based on their feedback the researchers revised the questionnaire to ensure content validity by eliminating ambiguity and possible confusion The nalized questionnaire was distributed by email or post to be anonymously completed by potential evaluators in three groups food processors food processingmanufacturing compa nies sales and distribution channels supermarkets importexport businesses eretailers and wholesalers and consumers Each group had potential evaluators received the questionnaire so in total the questionnaire reached potential evaluators For the evaluators from the industry sectors we employed a purpo sivejudgmental sampling approach Saunders et al to target those who are most knowledgeable on the subject We only in vited participations from senior executivesmanagerssupply chain heads and business owners This was to ensure the quality of the data and the validity of the results The data collection was sup ported by three branches of a regional government in northern China namely the Development and Reform Commission the Bu reau of Commerce and Food Safety Committee For responses from consumers a convenience sampling method was adopted A total of questionnaires were returned from three groups of evalua tors among which complete responses were considered valid for the Fuzzy DEMATEL analysis Tables and show the prole of these evaluators Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption DEMATEL Analysis In this research we apply the fuzzy DEMATEL technique using the following steps to analyze the barriers to sustainable food con sumption and production Venkatesh et al explained in de tails the technical procedures of the Fuzzy DEMATEL technique Step Constituting the expert panel focused group and naliz ing the decision variables Step

value is negative Lin Results and analysis The following section presents Fuzzy DEMATEL analysis results The totalrelation matrices for three evaluator groups are provided in Tables and respectively and they quantify the impact rela tionships between all the barriers The R C and RC scores for each evaluator category are presented in Tables and respectively along with the evaluators importance rankings and Fuzzy DEMA TEL based rankings Moreover causeeffect diagrams are developed for each evaluator group separately and presented as Figs and The signicant relationships between barriers are also mapped on the causeeffect diagrams by arrows to highlight their interde pendence We mapped the signicant relationships highlighted as bold values above a threshold value calculated by adding standard deviations to the mean of the totalrelation matrix T following Li and Tzeng s recommendations on using appro priate threshold levels Fuzzy DEMATEL results of the food processors Fuzzy DEMATEL analysis results of the rst evaluator group ie food processors are presented in Table Table and Fig From these results we observe that weak legal enforcement B lack of investment in advanced

longterm effort s should be made to address these issues Similarly the barriers with the highest prominence values have the poten tial to affect andor be affected by other barriers Therefore man agers and policymakers should prioritize addressing or circumvent ing these in the shortterm presenting a practical approach to the otherwise complex web of political technological and insti tutional structures Papargyropoulou et al The interdepen dencies and interrelationships highlight the previously noted im portance of integrated decision making in CE activities and design Lechner and Reimann Table summarizes the overall results and provides a com parison of key cause and high prominence barriers The results reveal many similarities in the responses of the three evaluator groups For example weak legal enforcement B is identied as a key cause barrier by all three evaluator groups This nding is in line with that of Farooque et al b which focused on bar riers to circular food supply chains in China All three evaluator groups also identify the lack of environmental education and ac countability B as a cause barrier which conrms the nding of Zhang et al on the barriers to smart waste manage ment in China The strength of legal enforcement is a societal ele ment that will affect all evaluator groups These results enable us to assess barriers beyond those that may be identied with insti tutional perspectives eg as in Ranta et al While there may be separate legal requirements that affect a given industry or evaluator group more than another there is a consensus that the weak enforcement of the legal framework in this area reduces the need for action this result is different to the identication of Yuan of an inadequate regulatory environment Simi larly the low levels of environmental education would inuence individuals acting within each of the evaluator groups longterm changes to a national curriculum would lead to positive changes within each evaluator group Zhang et al Greater education will enable rms to enhance their awareness addressing concerns identied by Liu and Bai collect better data Yuan and develop improved performance monitoring systems Su et al In the same way there is a consensus among the study evalu ators on the role of barrier B lack of economies of scale Food processors consider it as key cause barrier whereas sales and dis tribution channels and consumers view it as the most prominent barrier The relatively small scale that many food processors oper ate on will mean that their lack of economies of scale will lead to and contribute more to other barriers in contrast the scale of many sales and distributions rms will mean that this is less likely to be a cause however given its high prominence score it will be one the short term challenges for the sales and distribution chan nels to address Moreover both the food processors and sales and distribution channels identied B inadequate infrastructure as the prominent barrier This is reasonable as these rms would rely on the provi sion of sucient infrastructure to support their effort s in sustain able food loss and waste management The inuence of infrastruc ture aligns with previous discussions on the need for more rms along the supply chain Boons and LdekeFreund and higher numbers of rms involved Veleva et al Lastly B lack of investment in advanced equipmenttechnologies is identied with high prominence by food processors and consumers The barrier has similarities to the nancing options in general CE studies in China Su et al however it is not considered as a barrier by sales and distribution channel members The reason they do not perceive it as a barrier is likely due to the size of the rms many food producers will be smaller rms and they along with consumers will be less endowed with nancial resources required to make or invest in sucient changes to improve food loss and waste management processes The sales and distribution rms tend to be larger and will tend to have sucient slack resources that can be redeployed to support sustainable food loss and waste man agement activities Despite these similarities there are some differences as well For example the cost barrier B was identied as the key cause barrier by sales and distribution channels This identication may relate to the relatively small margins and level of intensity in many retail and distribution environments such tight margins would preclude investments with indenite payoffs This suggests oppor tunities for the design and implementation of improved incen tivization schemes Su et al Lack of expertise B was identied by food processors as the most prominent barrier in their case The lack of capability and expertise in the staff will be related to the low levels of general capabilities in society partly driven by low levels of education in this area and the sudden need for the rm to gain this expertise A general need for expertise Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption means such expertise will be hard to acquire and it will be chal lenging to overcome the skill shortage Without the right skills it will be dicult to use new technologies and this may relate to the previously identied issue of a lack of highend CE technologies The study results also reveal that the key cause and prominent barriers are different from barriers rankings based on the evalua tors importance rankings across the three evaluators see Tables and These differences demonstrate the importance of how techniques such as Fuzzy DEMATEL allows us to perceive the hid den interrelationships between the evaluators responses that they are unable to perceive themselves Theoretical contributions The study design was based on both stakeholder theory and TRA The results provide evidence that there are different barri ers as perceived by each of the stakeholders It also provides rms with a mechanism to identify which barriers are important to other stakeholders as the barriers are addressedresolved a spe cic and tailored communication plan can be developed to com municate this to the other two distinct stakeholder groups that were included in the study addressing the areas of greatest im portance to the other stakeholders and increasing inclusivity in the management of supply chain processes Boons and Ldeke Freund The analysis of relationships between barriers provides new in sight into TRA in the applications within CE The results provide an analysis of the interactions between the barriers and these are im plicitly addressing both inter and intraorganizational subjective norms Vergragt and Quist As a result future work that seeks to develop mechanisms to inuence behaviour under pres sure from external stakeholders can use these results to analyse the potential for the cocreation of sustainability processes and food loss and waste management Schrder et al Future research might extend the TRA analysis by providing perspectives from government policy makers as a key inuencer of subjec tive norms in the country Understanding the relationship between barriers also enhances decisionmaking for managers as they can isolate and address barriers in a systematic approach addressing challenges to the transition to a CE business model that is prof itable Loon and Wassenhove Governing bodies and Boards of Directors may also implement measurement models and metrics that force greater managerial consideration of the CE requirements Bai et al Implications for Practice and Policy The results and ndings presented above provide insights from three different types of representative stakeholders food proces sors sales and distribution channels and consumers The identied barriers and their interdependencies indicate a strong role for both managerial decisionmakers as well as government policy makers to work in unison to develop frameworks metrics and industrial structures to systematically address the barriers From the results presented in section we develop the following implications for policy and practice First weak legal enforcement is one of the fundamental reasons behind the largely absentineffective food loss and waste manage ment mechanism in China This weak enforcement remains dis tinct from the presence of regulations Yuan Farooque et al b but may be related to the complexities of localized admin istration and coordination Su et al The complexities of the agrifood systems also make it dicult to enforce legalisation as CE implementation requires infrastructure support along the whole supply chain from farmers to food processors wholesalers retail ers logistics service providers consumers and waste management organizations However specic examples exist of enhanced en forcement For instance in Shanghai City from July they have begun to enforce the new Regulations on the Management of Household Waste Xinhaunet This includes both require ments for individuals and organizations to comply with nes of RMB for individuals and up to RMB for organiza tions The rst tranche consisting of nes were applied af ter inspecting communities enterprises and institutions rms and other groups At this time the rst batch of social supervisors for domestic waste management were employed Other legal requirements include the Environmental Protection Law re cently enhanced to make punishments stricter However they fo cus on the most polluting industries rather than food loss or waste While the Circular Economy Promotion Law was amended in there are no provisions specic on food loss or waste The Anti food Waste Law April focuses on food security and has un clear measurements and weak punishments generating what will likely be weak enforcement From these measures specic initia tives should include nes suciently high to deter undesired ac tions food waste and loss should be acknowledged as a key driver in the environmental protection and CE promotion laws and the measurements and requirements for compliance should be clear and simple for citizens to understand Second the lack of environmental education and accountabil ity is a major contributor to the lack of food waste management culture throughout the food systemsfood supply chains The is sue is complicated by the need to involve multiple stakeholders in the industry Yuan Zhang et al As it often takes years and even generations to change a culture the journey to a CE in China is likely to be a marathon for achieving SCP In dustry groups will need to include multiple stakeholders and de velop joint systems and metrics that can be agreed on and applied widely to improve accountability Ocials can also be employed in roles that directly hold organizations accountable such as in Shang hai in Xinhaunet Third the Lack of economies of scale in collecting and pro cessing food wastes for value recovery is a primary concern of food supply chain stakeholders and this inhibits investments in food waste management Greater inclusion of rms over the sup ply chain Boons and LdekeFreund and moving beyond the effort s of an individual rm Veleva et al will be neces sary In cities like Shanghai and Beijing where there is infrastruc ture for household waste sorting consumers need to separate food wastes at source to allow them to be collected and consolidated for value recovery The barrier in the economies of scale is likely to be overcome when there is increased participation by rms and con sumers in sustainable food waste management Measures such as the use of Industry technologies may help smaller rms to col laborate in a way that they can overcome some of the scalebased challenges Rosa et al Given the results further attention by food processors and dis tribution rms in the supply chain must be placed on developing solutions to the source separation challenge Through careful re design of collection processes the waste management processes for rms can recover value from food wastes When this waste is separated from the waste that is directed to landll rms will be able to support their transition to a circular supply chain in the food industry while maintaining protability Loon and Wassen hove Consumer separation of waste is also necessary and as much of household waste is food waste there is increasingly the need for rms to invest in source separation but also the subsequent waste treatment facilities and associated capabilities Such infrastructure may use food wastes to create organic fertilizers generate biogases and feedstock New technology platforms and Industry may en able this collaboration within the sector Rosa et al These Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption initiatives may require wider collaboration outside of traditional collaboration within the sector and may require developing cross sectoral initiatives to tackle waste management challenges Lessons from pilots in China and elsewhere suggest that technologies can improve separation of waste effort s Wang et al improve consumer understanding and behaviors Li et al and mon etary subsidies can inuence behaviors Owusu et al Firms should work to enhance their capability and expertise in CE Sehnem et al Subramanian et al and food waste management Large rms may implement training programmes The prominence of this barrier also suggests a role for thirdparty training organizations to provide certication and training both for existing staff able to leverage the expertise immediately and for job seekers who will be able to apply their developed expertise to benet employers These results have clear implications for policymakers in addi tion to managers First there is a role for the Chinese government to take a more active role in their involvement in food waste CE and add additional regulatory pressures on participants All evalua tors have identied the need for regulatory change as a crucial bar rier that policymakers are best positioned to overcome The funda mental problem here is not the lack of CE legislation in China but its lack of enforcement caused by a variety of reasons The legis lation process in China is topdown and usually involves very lim ited public participation or consultation Consequently many laws are not widely known or supported by the public Furthermore a piece of legislation may be passed when the required physical and institutional infrastructure is still not in place making it practically infeasible to be enforced Overall the legal system in China is still underdeveloped and the court system is not independent from the government administration as in the Western countries Therefore a wellintended CE legislation is not necessarily in the priority list of local government ocials when there are more urgent matters competing for their attention Second the government should offer nancial supports to sus tainable food loss and waste management activities In compar ison with many developed countries the population density in most Chinese cities is much higher which creates an advantage for achieving the economies of scale in food waste collection and processing Nevertheless the economic value that can be recovered from most food wastes is low so there is a lack of economic incen tive among food waste management organizations To overcome this issue the government may consider offering and increasing subsidies to the involved organizations Experiences in Ghana sug gest that direct incentives to households can improve participate in waste source separation initiatives Owusu et al The government may also consider increasing investments in the es sential infrastructure required for source separation of food waste food waste collection and value recovery operations such as com posting anaerobic digestion and wastetoenergy conversion Such green investments are justiable as sustainable food loss and waste management has substantial environmental benets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions which helps combat climate change It also helps restore soil fertility which enables more sustainable farming An additional policy role is the improvement of educational in vestments in improving food loss and waste management There is a clear need for both business professionals and consumers to have greater insight into the importance and mechanisms for sustain able food loss and waste management and changing the nature of national educational systems and national curricula would address this concern Specic education initiatives could include advertis ing and promotional material Initiatives could also consider the use of social supervisors for domestic waste management which was introduced in Shanghai in Xinhaunet While China rst implemented environmental education in to en hance awareness in two curriculums were updated in pri mary and secondary schools In and two national action guidelines for environmental communication and education were promulgated The current environmental education system focuses on professional education and less em phasis is placed on the general citizenship Tian and Wang Whereas the outcomes of the education are not clear there are challenges in how to change attitudes and behaviors For instance there is no detailed accountability system and so there seems to be little incentive for behavior change relating to food loss and waste A nal element that policymakers may consider is the impor tance of separating waste streams Wang et al reported multiple successful cases of using internet of things IoT tech nologies to enable accountability in household waste source sep aration in China The implementation pilots proved the feasibility of inducing a behavioral change by providing incentives to split and separate waste streams clearly They also showed the prac ticality of using IoT technologies to achieve accountability which directly overcame one of the key cause barriers to promote ef fective waste management Similarly the techniques outlined by Li et al can help households to understand the composi tion of waste and begin to inuence their behaviors towards waste source separation A primary outcome of these changes would be to enhance the economies of scale of waste management Im proved economies of scale should overcome the hesitation and re luctance of business managers to make necessary investments to enhance their waste management processes Conclusions The level of food loss and waste globally appears to spark con cern but the problem is driven by different stakeholder groups each with different perspectives and concerns The existing studies mainly investigated food waste management in the consumption stage Despite food processing and salesdistribution stages have substantial environmental impacts no study has systematically in vestigated sustainability barriers in these stages along with those in the consumption stage This study narrows this knowledge gap in the research context of China the worlds largest developing country which has an ambition toward a transition to a CE This study makes several key contributions First we use ex pert panel data drawn from three supply chain stakeholder groups food processors sales and distribution rms and consumers and we believe that this research is the rst to address the barriers to food loss and waste management for CE The study has a signi cant contribution in identifying major barriers from the perspec tives of three supply chain stakeholder groups and highlighting the causal relationships between these barriers Second the study results make signicant contributions to practice and the transition towards CE The results provide a path way for a structured approach to addressing the barriers along the supply chain to improve sustainable food consumption and pro duction in China The causal nature and relationships suggest se quences of changes that can be made to maximise outcomes by addressing the key cause barriers with the rst initiatives We identify weak legal enforcement and lack of environmental ed ucation and accountability as key cause barriers that are con sistently identied along the food supply chain by all the food processors sales and distribution channels and consumers Such a cause barrier suggests that a transition would be enhanced by careful policy making to enhance the food production sector with stricter measurement enforcement of regulations and provision of household subsidies Technologies can be used to improve com pliance and enhance education and household understanding of waste separation Applications of subsidies and direct monetary in centives can also inuence household behaviors Also food pro Y Liu LC Wood VG Venkatesh et al Sustainable Production and Consumption cessors perceive the lack of economies of scale as a critical cause barrier and the inadequate infrastructure lack of investment in ad vanced equipmenttechnologies and lack of expertise as prominent barriers Sales and distribution rms perceive the cost barriers as a key cause barrier and the infrastructure and lack of economies of scale as prominent barriers The consumers see the lack of invest ment in advanced equipmenttechnologies cost barriers and the economies of scale as prominent barriers Together these ndings should support government and business decisionmaking in sup porting a transition to a more sustainable circular economy and targeting the development of new policies and investments in ap propriate infrastructure to reduce food loss and waste Last but not the least this study makes strong theoretical contributions This study employed dual theoretical lenses of the stakeholder theory and TRA at the rm level to explore the bar riers to sustainable food consumption and production The study ndings arm the explanatory power of these two theories there fore provide guidance to further studies on sustainable consump tion and production Future research should conduct similar studies in other coun tries to enable us to understand the role of culture in inuenc ing these barriers Some barriers eg legal enforcement and ed ucation will be driven by the specics of the countries studied A crossnational study may support the identication of barriers that will be more generalizable to other settings Future research will also need to be conducted on how to overcome these barri ers while these results present a causal connection between the barriers additional exploratory research may uncover solutions to managing the barriers grounded in leading industrial practices and through the development and implementation of effective metrics Sectorspecic studies that may be qualitative or based on action research may enable mechanisms to be determined that support rms in overcoming barriers such as the key cause barriers of cost economies of scale and
