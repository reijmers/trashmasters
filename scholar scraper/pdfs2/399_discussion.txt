Based on case studies,  two main roles of digital technologies  are 
identiﬁed  as enabler  and trigger ( Nambisan,  2013 :

2) Digital technologies  as trigger:  how digital technologies  can ini-

organizational  routines  and mechanisms?

ence is made by the data analysis  part that we can evaluate  more 
deeply.  With the case ﬁndings,  we identiﬁed  data analysis  func- 
tionalities  as Monitoring  product  location,  condition  & availability;
