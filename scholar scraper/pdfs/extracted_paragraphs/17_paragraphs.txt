Non-household  end-use  plastics:  the  ‘forgotten’  plastics for  the  circular  economy Kerstin  Kleinhans1,2,3,  Ruben  Demets1,2,  Jo  Dewulf3, Kim  Ragaert2and  Steven  De  Meester1 It  is  commonly  agreed  in  the  current  legislative  and  scientiﬁc discourse  that  plastics  recycling  rates  should  be  increased. Many  recycling  studies  are  dedicated  towards  this,  but  often they  focus  on  post-household  plastic  waste.  Non-household end-use  plastics  seems  to  be  forgotten  in  data  gathering,  policy making  and  research,  but  have  promising  potential  for  high quality  recycling.  In  this  manuscript  we  bring  together  the  most recent  existing  literature  on  non-household  end-use  plastic waste  and  offer  a  framework  for  shifting  future  waste management  plans  to  effectively  help  increasing  recycling rates.

Introduction Currently  the  global  average  plastic  recycling  rate  is below  20%  .  This  low  plastic  recycling  rate  is  widely addressed  and  targeted  for  example,  in  European  policy or  the  U.S.  Plastics  Pact  .  Increasing  plastic  recycling rates  is  important  to  become  a  sustainable  and  resource- efﬁcient  society  as  plastics  released  in  the  environment cause  environmental  problems  and  the  traditional  pro- duction  of  plastics  is  dependent  on  our  fossil  fuel  reserves .  The  focus  of  policy  guidelines  as  well  as  researchoften  lies  on  post-consumer  packaging  waste  ,  as  it  is the  largest  plastic  waste  stream  .  In  this,  the  terminol- ogy  of  consumption  means  household  consumption, whereas  the  ISO  deﬁnition  of  ‘post-consumer’  in  fact relates  to  all  activities  where  waste  is  disposed  by  an end-user,  including  end-users  that  are  for  example,  com- panies    or  shops  . Post-consumer  waste  of  industrial  or  commercial  origins  is quite  diverse,  in  type,  composition  and  level  of  contami- nation  depending  strongly  on  its  disposing  entity.  How- ever,  this  waste  is  signiﬁcantly  different  from  household waste.  Some  examples  include  ﬂexible  ﬁlm  that  is  used  as secondary  packaging  (be  it  around  pallets  or  for  individual items  like  in  clothing  shops),  EPS  for  packaging  purposes and  rigid  plastics  from  temporary  products  like  displays  or crates  ,  crates,  canisters/ barrels).  Quantities  and  recycling  rates  for  these  speciﬁc plastic  waste  streams  are  typically  poorly  reported  in scientiﬁc  and  grey  literature,  if  reported  at  all. The  goal  of  this  manuscript  is  therefore  twofold:  ﬁrstly,  to address  the  often  confusing  terminology  regarding  types of  plastic  waste  and  secondly,  to  review  the  most  recent studies  that  address  quantities,  composition,  collection, and  recycling  potential  of  non-household  end-use  plastic waste.  Additionally,  we  discuss  the  bottlenecks  and opportunities  for  this  type  of  plastic  waste  to  contribute to  a  circular  economy  for  plastics. Terminology The  ﬁrst  issue  is  that  the  terminology  and  commonly  used deﬁnitions  do  not  speciﬁcally  address  non-household end-use  plastics.  ISO  14021:2016  distinguishes  pre-  and post-consumer  material  .  Pre-consumer  material, often  referred  to  as  post-industrial  waste,  is  deﬁned  as ‘material  diverted  from  the  waste  stream  during  a manufacturing  process.  Excluded  is  reutilization  of  mate- rials  such  as  rework,  regrind  or  scrap  generated  in  a process  and  capable  of  being  reclaimed  within  the  same process  that  generated  it.’  .  The  same  ISO  norm deﬁnes  post-consumer  material  as  waste  generated  by ‘end-users  such  as  commercial,  industrial  and  institutional facilities,  next  to  households’  .  This  deﬁnition  is commonly  used,  for  example,  in  Eurostat    or  EPA   databases.  In  parallel,  the  term  municipal  waste  is  used to  address  wastes  collected  by  municipalities  no  matter the  origin    [14–Available  online  at  www.sciencedirect.com ScienceDirect www.sciencedirect.com  Current  Opinion  in  Chemical  Engineering  2021,  1:100680 17].  The  common  terms  ‘post-consumer  waste’  and ‘municipal  waste’  are  thus  a  group  term  for  both  house- hold  and  non-household  waste.  An  overview  of  commonly used  terminology  can  be  found  in  Figure  1. When  looking  deeper  into  these  types  of  waste,  we  can see  that  they  are  inherently  different.  Plastic  waste  from households  often  comprises  a  complex  material  mix  that is  prone  to  contaminations,  as  it  contains  typical  products bought  for  example,  in  supermarkets  as  PET  Bottles, PET  trays,  PE  bottles,  PP  bottles  and  trays,  ﬁlms  such  as food  wraps,  and  so  on.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  end- user  is  a  business,  industry  or  institution,  typical  plastic waste  products  are  secondary  packaging  that  might  be eligible  for  high  end  recycling  on  their  own  but  might  not end  up  in  a  suitable  recycling  scheme.  Looking  to  thedifference  in  typology  of  waste,  it  can  be  questioned  if they  should  fall  within  the  same  terminological  classiﬁ- cation,  being  ‘post-consumer’. Another  commonly  used  terminology  is  commercial  and industrial    waste.  This  might  cause  confusion,  as pre-consumer  waste  is  also  referred  to  as  post-industrial waste,  which  also  includes  industrial  scraps  of  high  purity. In  this  sense,  there  is  a  distinction  between  industry  that produces,  and  industry  that  ‘consumes’.  Following  a standardized  classiﬁcation  for  economic  activities,  for example,  the  European  ‘NACE’  codes  [https://ec. europa.eu/competition/mer gers/cases/index/nace_all. html],  plastic  producing  sectors  include  amongst  others ‘20.16  Manufacture  of  plastics  in  primary  forms’  and  ‘22.2 Manufacture  of  plastic  products’.  All  other  sectors  in  fact2  Frontiers:  energy,  environment  and  sustainability:  plastics  in  the  environment Figure  1 Manufacturing of  inte rmediate   prod ucts Manu fac turing of  articles for end-  usePlastics converting  secto rs Conv erting inte  rmediate  prod ucts to  pac kaging or  consumer goods End-use & disposal  in  industrial op  erations End-use & dispo  sal  in  comm ercial op  erationsIndustrial &  comm ercial secto  rs End-use & dispo  sal o f  pac kaging  or  consumer goodsHouseholds Towards wast  e mana  gementPost-consumer materi  al  Pre-con  sumer materi  al  Non-mun  icipal wast  e/ po st-industrial waste  Munici  pal waste Pre-consumer  end-use pla  stic wasteNon-ho  usehold end-use pla  stic wasteHousehold end-use pla  stic wasteCommonly used definitionsSuggested  definition Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering Overview  of  used  definitions  on  the  example  of  plastic  waste.

Current  Opinion  in  Chemical  Engineering  2021,  1:100680  www.sciencedirect.com consume  plastic  products  from  these  sectors,  which means  that  other  manufacturing  business  or  commercial activities  act  like  end-users  of  plastic  items.  As  an  exam- ple,  PET-trays  and  LDPE  wrapping  ﬁlm  that  serves  as packaging  of  car  parts  in  a  car  manufacturing  company and  is  disposed  there,  is  not  post-industrial  waste,  but should  be  more  clearly  classiﬁed  separately.  Therefore, we  propose  to  consistently  differentiate  between  the terminology  ‘non-household  end-use  plastics’  and ‘household  end-use  plastics’.  Note  that  in  this  proposed terminology,  the  term  ‘consumption’  is  also  replaced  by ‘end-use’,  as  this  seems  more  suited  to  capture  what happens  to  plastic  as  consumption  might  be  more  suited for  applications  such  as  food. Quantities To  our  knowledge,  there  is  hardly  any  scientiﬁc  study with  a  systematic  focus  on  solely  non-household  end-use plastics  and  its  potential  for  the  circular  economy.  The few  studies  on  this  topic  focus  on  mixed  commercial  and industrial  waste,  including  but  not  limited  to  plastics. Table  1  gives  an  overview  on  the  studies  available  on  non- household    waste  typically  performed  with  a speciﬁc  regional  focus. Already  in  2000  it  was  pointed  out  that  literature  with non-household  type  waste  in  general  is  scarce  .  Sev- eral  other  authors  conﬁrm  that  this  waste  streams  are  notwell  recorded  in  the  EU  and  that  detailed  global  data  are missing  .  This  is  said  very  aptly  by  De  Weerdt et  al.  in  a  study  focusing  on  the  effect  of  waste  incineration taxation  by  noticing  the  asymmetry  between  the  limited studies  compared  to  its  amounts  of  waste  generation, calling  it  even  ‘paradoxical’  .  This  lack  of  data  hinders policy  makers  to  set  clear  target  and  recognition  of opportunities  . Those  presented  studies    give  a  ﬁrst  glimpse  on the  quantities  of  non-household  end-use  plastic  waste produced,  but  it  remains  hard  to  deduct  numbers  with great  conﬁdence.  The  scarce  data  sources  indicate  that non-household  type  waste  streams,  when  collected comingled  with  other  materials,  have  a  plastic  content of  approximately  10–20%.  Following  the  assumption  that non-household  end-use  plastic  waste  mainly  consist  of secondary  packaging,  it  allows  the  estimation  based  on the  study  of  Hestin  et  al.  of  5300  kt/a  of  non-household end-use  plastic  waste  in  the  EU  .  Transferring  the information  of  Australia  (158.8  kt/a  C&I  plastic  waste   with  25.68  M  inhabitants)  and  Germany  (1385  kt/a municipal  commercial  plastic  waste    with  83.19  M inhabitants)  towards  EU27    we  esti- mate  2768  kt/a  and  7453  kt/a  non-household  end-use plastics  for  the  EU27,  respectively,  which  are  thus  in the  same  order  of  magnitude  compared  to  the  ﬁrst  esti- mate  based  on  Hestin  et  al.  .Non-household  end-use  plastics:  forgotten  plastics  Kleinhans  et  al.  3 Table  1 Average  plastic  content  reported  for  non-household  waste  streams  for  the  last  recent  years Plastic contentPlastic quantities Plastic quantities per capital aWaste  type  speciﬁcation according  to  authorsRegion  Year  Source 17.65a–  –  Municipal  commercial wasteAustria  2018/2019  Weissenbach  et  al.   –  116.5  10.16cCommercial  waste  Belgium  2018  Valipac   10.1  –  –  Commercial  waste  Hoi  An  City,  Vietnam  2016  Phu  et  al.   –  291/C0378  –  Industrial  plastic containers  and packagingJapan  2015  Nakatani  et  al.   7  –  –  Commercial  and industrial  wasteAustralia  2013  Bremner  et  al.   –  158.8  6.18dCommercial  and industrial  wasteAustralia  2015/2016  OECD   –  736/C0924  –  Non-consumer  UK  2017  WRAP   /C2420  1385b16.64eMunicipal  commercial wasteGermany  2012,  2013  and 2015Dehne  et  al.   21.8  –  –  Commercial  solid  waste  Mexicali,  Baja  California, Mexico2012  Gardun ˜o-P.  et  al.   –  5300a–  Commercial  and industrial  polyoleﬁn  and PET  wasteEU  2014  Hestin  et  al.   aCalculated  based  on  information  given  in  the  study. bUnder  doubt  of  authors. cCalculated  based  on  11.46  M  inhabitants  . dCalculated  based  on  25.69  M  inhabitants  . eCalculated  based  on  83.19  M  inhabitants  . www.sciencedirect.com  Current  Opinion  in  Chemical  Engineering  2021,  1:100680 Eurostat  gives  additional  information  on  the  origin  of plastic  waste  by  NACE  activity  in  the  EU27  ,  that can  be  found  in  the  Supplementary  Material Figure  1.  Overall,  13  850  kt/a  plastic  waste  from  commer- cial  or  industrial  origin  are  reported  compared  to 16  800  kt/a  from  households.  The  sectors  C  (Manufactur- ing)  and  G-U    are  reported  to  produce  the largest  amounts  of  plastic  waste.  For  the  manufacturing sector  ,  data  for  additional  10  subsectors  are  available, whereas  ‘Manufacture  of  chemical,  pharmaceutical,  rub- ber  and  plastic  products’    with  41.83%, ‘Manufacture  of  food  products;  beverages  and  tobacco products’    with  19.69%  and  ‘Manufacture of  computer,  electronic  and  optical  products,  electrical equipment,  motor  vehicles  and  other  transport equipment’    with  14.09%  are  the  three biggest  plastic  waste  producing  sectors. Assuming  that  plastic  waste  reported  for  the  NACE sectors  E  (Water  supply;  sewerage,  waste  management and  remediation  activities),  G  46.77  (Wholesale  of  waste and  scrap)  and  20–22  (Manufacture  of  chemical,  pharma- ceutical,  rubber  and  plastic  products)  does  not  fall  under our  deﬁnition  of  non-household  end-use  plastics  the expected  plastic  quantities  for  the  EU27  would  reduce to  6310  kt/a  that  comes  close  to  the  estimation  of  5300  kt/ a  by  Hestin  et  al.    who  only  accounting  for  packaging material. There  is  the  indication  from  a  Belgian  study  [https:// www.valipac.be/nl/waar-bel andt-ons-bedrijfsmatig- plastic-verpakkingsafval-uiteindelijk/ ]  that  more  than 50%  of  non-household  plastic  waste  is  exported  outside of  the  EU.  WRAP  conﬁrms  this  and  gives  an  indication that  the  amounts  estimated  could  be  even  higher  than 50%  .  Exported  plastic  waste  and  landﬁlling  can  be identiﬁed  as  one  of  the  main  pathways  that  release plastics  towards  the  environment,  for  example,  as  ocean debris  . Composition The  recycling  potential  for  plastics  is,  among  others, dependent  on  the  polymer  types  and  contamination levels  present  in  the  waste  stream  .  Diving  deeper into  compositional  data  of  non-household  end-use  waste, big  varieties  can  be  noted  in  the  share  of  plastic, explained  by  the  diversity  of  types  and  size  of  thebusinesses  .  Hestin  et  al.    report  speciﬁcally a  share  of  58%  ﬁlm,  24%  bottles  and  ﬂasks  and  18%  of Pots,  Tubes  and  Trays    in  European  commercial and  industrial  plastic  packaging  waste,  see Table  2.  Dehne  et  al.  conﬁrms  that  ﬁlm  and  rigid  plastic are  the  biggest  types  in  municipal  commercial  waste  . A  study  from  the  United  Nations  Environment  Programm reports  that  non-household  end-use  plastics  mainly comprises  PE,  PP,  PS  and  PVC  .  This  can  be  con- ﬁrmed  by  other  authors  and  the  fact  that  these  polymers make  part  of  the  biggest  types  of  polymers  produced .  Hestin  et  al.    provides  information on  the  share  of  polymer  type  per  type  that  can  be  found  in Table  2.  Next  to  that,  Table  3  gives  data  on  the  share  of polymer  type  in  C&I  waste  in  Australia  . Collection The  collection  rate  of  commercial  and  industrial  plastic packaging  waste  in  the  EU  is  stated  to  be  39%  . Collection  costs  of  non-household  waste  are  signiﬁcantly lower  compared  to  post-household  waste  as  there  are more  consistent  and  the  amounts  are  generally  large .  According  to  ongoing  research  and  expert  judg- ment  from  recyclers  and  collectors,  it  can  be  stated  that signiﬁcant  amounts  of  non-household  plastic  waste  still end  up  in  the  residual  bin,  especially  from  small  and medium-sized  enterprises  .  Companies  state  that they  either  do  not  know  other  collection  systems,  think their  waste  amounts  are  insigniﬁcant  or  think  that  it  is more  convenient  than  a  source  separated  collection.  In comparison  to  post-household  waste,  the  collection  is often  done  by  private  operators  instead  of  being  organized by  the  local  municipalities.  Plastic  waste  from  the  com- mercial  sector  and  SMEs,  in  contrast,  might  also  be collected  via  a  municipal  collector  but  often  as  part  of a  mixed  residual  waste  fraction  .  Furthermore,  they4  Frontiers:  energy,  environment  and  sustainability:  plastics  in  the  environment Table  2 Share  of  generated  type  and  polymer  of  commercial  and  indus- trial  packaging  waste  in  the  EU    by  Ref.  .

Both  these  points  have  as consequence  that  data  on  these  fractions  is  not  systemat- ically  monitored  per  region  and  producing  sector  . Potential  for  the  circular  economy Studies  on  the  recycling  potential  of  non-household  end- use  type  materials  are  likewise  scarce  .  Whole  frac- tions  of  mixed  commercial  waste,  like  plastics,  could  in  fact be  recyclable  but  due  to  technical  issues  (e.g.  disassem- bling  of  composites)  or  contamination  this  is  not  econom- ically  feasible  .  Therefore  it  is  commonly  used  as  solid recovered  fuel    thanks  to  high  caloric  value  and  low water  content  . To  our  knowledge,  there  are  no  studies  yet  on  the recycling  potential  merely  focusing  on  non-household end-use  plastics.  Some  sources  state  that  this  waste  tends to  be  of  higher  quality  compared  to  household  plastic waste  .  According  to  the  author’s  experience,  this valuable  material  is  often  downgraded  by  mixed  collec- tion,  which  signiﬁcantly  contaminates  the  ‘cleaner’  plas- tics,  turning  recyclable  plastics  into  residual  waste. Analyzing  the  studies  discussed  in  Sections  ‘Quantities’ and  ‘Composition’  gives  a  glimpse  on  the  quantities  of non-household  end-use  plastic,  which  can  give  a  ﬁrst estimation  on  their  potential  contribution  to  the  circular economy.  Knowing  that  total  post-consumer  plastic  waste generated  in  the  EU28  +  NO/CH  is  29.1  M  t/a    or 23.7  M  t/a  in  the  EU27  ,  the  quantities  estimated  in Section  ‘Quantities’    shows  that  the  non- household  plastic  waste  is  expected  to  contribute  some- where  between  10–30%  of  the  recycling  rate  of  the  EU, and  it  thus  has  a  big  potential  to  reach  the  ambitions plastic  recycling  targets  of  the  EU  and  beyond.  These numbers  have  a  focus  on  the  EU,  but  it  is  expected  to  be in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  for  other  areas  such  as  the USA  or  Southeast  Asian  (data  for  plastic  content  in  MSW for  example,  to  be  found  in  Refs.    or  ). Discussion Based  on  the  above  ﬁndings  we  introduce  the  term ‘forgotten  plastics’  for  non-household  end-use  plastic. Generally,  industrial  actors  and  some  policy  makers  are well  aware  that  these  waste  streams  exist,  yet  these potentially  highly  recyclable  plastics  typically  disappear in  the  overall  waste  statistics  and  consequently,  policies, and  scientiﬁc  research  does  not  address  it  separately,  also caused  by  the  lack  of  data.  Literature  indicates  that  in terms  of  quantity  and  quality  they  could  signiﬁcantly contribute  to  the  circular  economy  for  plastics. To  give  non-household  end-use  plastic  waste  a  chance  to become  part  of  a  circular  economy,  the  lack  of  data  and the  related  of  lack  of  attention  that  has  been  lasting  for  a few  decades    has  to  end.  We  therefore  propose  astrategy  to  mitigate  the  current  status  quo  of  recycling non-household  end-use  plastic  waste,  which  is  depicted in  Figure  2. First,  a  clear  terminology  has  to  be  introduced  that  allows setting  the  right  focus  on  data  collection,  research,  and policymaking.  We  propose  to  systematically  subdivide the  ISO  deﬁnition  of  post-consumer  waste  into  household and  non-household  material  and  thereby  acknowledging the  difference  in  origin,  composition,  and  recycling potential. Secondly,  to  mitigate  arguments  on  the  economic  feasi- bility  of  recycling  these  non-household  fraction,  a  struc- tural  collection  of  data  on  quantities  and  qualities  has  to  be done  based  on  the  terminology  as  described  above. Thereby  it  is  crucial  to  analyze  different  sectorsNon-household  end-use  plastics:  forgotten  plastics  Kleinhans  et  al.  5 Figure  2 Und erstand ing the status qu  o by structural  coll ecti on of data of waste generati  on and  compositi  ons per NACE sectorsData on quality   and quantitie  sIntrodu cti on of a clear terminology for  non-h ousehold end-u  se waste for use in data  gathering, resea  rch & poli  cy makingCle ar terminology Creati ng local bu  siness  cases, e.g.,   new recycli  ng  faciliti es and  creati ng bus ine ss links  to create a  local network for a circular economyCirc ular business   casesFinding the optimal trade-off   betwee n suff icient  material coll  ecti on to make a coll  ecti on system  economicall  y and  prov iding the best qu  alit y for  recycli ng poss  ible, e.g.,   by source separationTailore  d waste manag  ement Behavior change Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering Flowchart  suggestion  to  bring  focus  on  non-household  end-use plastics  in  the  future.

Gathering  data  on  this  type  of  waste  will  be  a  challenge,  as a  statistically  relevant  number  of  business  should  be analyzed,  preferably  per  NACE  code  to  gain  insight  in the  diversity  of  this  type  of  waste.  Furthermore,  there  is also  a  diversity  within  each  NACE  code  related  to  for example  company  size.  Data  should  thus  preferably  be analyzed  per  NACE  codes  and  expressed  as  waste  per employee  or  per  turnover  .  Data  on  composition  up to  polymer  level  is  lacking  as  well,  despite  this  being crucial  information  for  high-end  recycling  solutions. Thirdly,  based  on  this  data  tailored  waste  management solutions  that  ﬁnd  an  optimal  trade-off  between  collecting sufﬁcient  tonnages  to  be  economically  feasible  but  also providing  highest  qualities  possible  should  be  introduced. Some  streams  might  be  sufﬁciently  clean  to  reprocess  as such,  whereas  others  need  to  be  kept  separate.  Based  on the  experience  of  the  author  team,  we  tend  to  believe  that it  will  be  difﬁcult  to  achieve  the  same  qualities  when performing  post-separation  instead  of  source  separation, even  with  state-of-the-art  technology.  We  encourage putting  future  research  focus  on  this.  Extended  studies on  lumping  strategies  of  different  kind  of  substreams  (e.g. per  sector,  per  polymer  type,  per  contamination  level)  of non-household  end-use  plastics  to  optimize  the  trade-off between  quality  and  quantity  are  needed.  In  this  sense, lumping  can  be  deﬁned  as  the  investigation  on  which plastic  waste  streams  can  be  mixed  or  absolutely  need  to be  excluded  during  collection  and  recycling  to  ensure best  recycling  quality  possible.  This  can  depend,  amongst others,  on  polymer  types,  contamination  level  and quantities. Further,  we  are  convinced  that  especially  urban  areas have  a  big  potential  for  developing  tailored  collection solutions  due  to  the  high  density  of  business  activities. Moreover,  innovative,  and  sustainable  collections  solu- tions,  for  example,  reverse  logistics,  electronic  vehicles  or transport  bicycles  should  be  investigated.  Also  introduc- ing  EPR  schemes  speciﬁcally  for  non-household  end-use could  provide  more  pronounced  ﬁnancial  incentives  . This  steps  can  be  the  starting  point  to  also  ﬁnd  linkages between  industries,  like  recommended  by  Chertow  et  al., to  create  circular  business  cases  .  To  reach  this,  studies like  Bremner  et  al.  or  Patricio  et  al.  for  multiple  business sectors  with  focus  on  plastic  waste  should  be  conducted .  The  purpose  of  a  circular  economy  for  plastics, and  thus  for  circular  business  models,  is  to  maintain products  and  materials  in  the  loop  through  several value-preserving  cycles,  such  as  repair,  reuse,  remanufac- turing  and  recycling  .  This  can  be  done  by  tailoring business  models  and  product  design,  amongst  others,  but since  plastics  often  move  fast  through  the  value  chain  it might  be  important  to  apply  for  example,  quadruple  helix approaches  to  reach  a  broader  group  of  stakeholders  Lu¨deke-Freund  give  a  comprehensive  review  on  existing circular  business  models  in  literature  and  conclude  that six  major  patterns  for  circular  business  models  are:  ‘repair and  maintenance;  reuse  and  redistribution;  refurbishment and  remanufacturing;  recycling;  cascading  and  repurpos- ing;  and  organic  feedstock  business  models’  .  Accent- ure  strategy    identiﬁes  the  following  ﬁve  circular business  models  as  most  promising:  resource  recovery, product-service  systems,  product-life  extensions,  sharing platforms  and  circular  value  chains  .  Especially  the latter    can  be  promising  as  local business  cases  for  non-household  plastic  waste,  for  exam- ple,  in  forms  of  a  local  plastic  hub  with  product  makers and  waste  owners  that  share  the   value  of  the  circular  plastics.  All  this  is  not  possible without  behavior  change  of  businesses  and  business  cases. Being  open  for  setting  up  a  recycling  system  for  plastics  in business,  using  more  materials  with  recycled  content  or using  recyclate  in  one’s  own  production,  needs  engaged decision  makers  in  the  businesses.  A  recent  study  by Khan  et  al.  analyzed  the  barriers  and  drivers  towards recycling  in  several  businesses  .  They  conclude  that there  is  an  intention-behavior  gap:  businesses  have  posi- tive  intentions  towards  best  practices  in  plastics  recycling but  seem  to  fail  to  implement  these.  They  recommend that  governments  have  to  offer  incentives,  disseminating knowledge,  and  creating  networking  platforms  for  collab- oration  among  decision  makers  to  overcome  this  . Conclusions Because  of  the  lack  of  clear  terminology  and  the  com- monly  used  division  in  pre-consumer  and  post-consumer waste,  end-use  plastic  waste  from  non-household  origin  is not  sufﬁciently  addressed  in  policy  making,  data  gather- ing  nor  in  research,  despite  its  high  potential  for  recycling. Therefore,  we  address  them  as  the  ‘forgotten  plastics  of the  circular  economy’  and  introduce  the  term  non-house- hold  end-use  plastic. The  limited  number  of  current  studies  on  quantities  of non-household  waste  like  streams  indicate  to  have  a plastic  content  of  around  10–20%.  We  estimate  a  range of  2800/C07500  kt/a  of  non-household  end-use  plastic waste  in  the  EU,  but  this  is  prone  to  high  variations  as it  depends  on  the  number,  type,  and  sizes  of  businesses. Non-household  plastics  can  thus  probably  contribute  by 10–30%  to  recycling  rate  targets  and  thus  play  an  essential role  in  the  circular  economy. Nevertheless,  overall  data  availability  is  poor  [1/C15,26/C15,27– 29].  This  holds  also  for  compositional  analyses.  Only  a  few studies  show  that  the  main  polymers  in  non-household end-use  plastic  are  of  PE,  PP,  PS  and  PVC  and  the  biggest waste  type  is  ﬁlm  material  , yet  from  a  different  typology  compared  to  household plastic  waste.  Non-household  end-use  plastic  from  SMEs are  often  collected  as  a  mixed  waste  fraction  and  which6  Frontiers:  energy,  environment  and  sustainability:  plastics  in  the  environment Current  Opinion  in  Chemical  Engineering  2021,  1:100680  www.sciencedirect.com decreases  its  potential  for  qualitative  recycling  as  the separate  waste  stream  would  usually  contain  less  contam- ination  compared  to  household  waste. Non-household  end-use  plastic  streams  can  play  an important  role  to  increase  overall  plastic  recycling  rates. To  do  so,  it  has  to  be  brought  into  the  picture  of  policy makers,  statistical  institutes,  and  research,  by  introducing clear  terminology,  structural  data  gathering,  tailored waste  management  solutions  and  the  creation  of  circular business  cases.  Moreover,  general  behavior  changes  of business  play  a  roll  into  all  these  points. This  review  hopes  to  have  sufﬁciently  highlighted  these ‘forgotten  plastics’  as  a  subject  for  further  research  and policy  making. Conﬂict  of  interest  statement Nothing  declared.
