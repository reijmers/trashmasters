I live in the UK and have weekly food waste and paper waste disposal, bi-weekly large green bins Canada style along with mixed recycling black bin. So I put all the bins out this Monday on collection day in a row and for some reason was the only house on the street not to have their food waste and paper recycling collected. I checked the food waste bin like &quot;Huh maybe this was emptied.&quot; only to open it and be greeted with a writhing ocean of maggots at the bottom in my food waste. Actually vile. The imagine is going to haunt me and live rent free in my head for weeks if not months. I wish we had collections like this but I am stuck in shitty UK suburbia, much more walkable and accessible than North American suburbs but still terribly lonely and now I am discovering inefficient in so many other ways :D"

We produce a lot of garbage, some weeks we have 7-15 bags, full size regular garbage bags. If something this has come in boxes with styrofoam, you need the giant bags to hold it all. It&#39;s a hassle getting that all to the curb as it is, having to walk more than a block with it? No way. In the winter it&#39;s a challenge to even not fall on the snow and ice. That tiny little thing sure wouldn&#39;t cut it with big garbage bags, what was tossed in looked the size of a grocery bag. What a nightmare. Yes it makes the streets look nicer and keeps animals out, but not practical whatsoever."

Garbage is disposed in large containers that are usually placed at the corner of the street, ocupping the part of the road where cars usually park. The underground version is also use sometimes. To avoid smell, usually the town askes to dump the garbage after 19h-20h, and the trucks pick up the trash in the night."

We get seagulls, and until we had underground containers here in The Hague, the seagulls would know the garbage schedule better than the humans living in the city. On the evening before garbage collection day in my neighbourhood, the seagulls would gather on the roofs in anticipation for the buffet that the humans would willingly offer them, putting out their garbage bags, which would invariably be ripped apart and their contents strewn all across the street and the sidewalk. If it was particularly windy, the trash would even get blown into gardens and parklands. And the screeching of those seagulls isn&#39;t cute. It sounds like crackheads having loud sex with each other. Next time you see a raccoon, pet them, and be thankful you have them in your trashbin and not a seagull."

I bet it&#39;s more like 100 meters each time, and I bet those bags pile up at the front door because no one wants to take them. So let&#39;s look at ten bags. That&#39;s 1,000 meters he&#39;s carried them. On the other hand, I have to carry each bag 6 meters to the bin. Once a week I push that bin another 6 meters to the curb.

They are nice in theory, but in reality I see them getting clogged/broken as often as every week, but usually every 14 days. When it&#39;s clogged, lot&#39;s of trash is piling up around them, because people have no where else to put their garbage bags. Then there&#39;s the wind, which blows the trash all over the streets around the underground bins. The other BIG downside: it takes the trucks a VERY long time to unload them. It may be fun to watch like the video suggests, but in reality it&#39;s often like 5-10 minutes of very high early morning noise pollution if you&#39;re unlucky enough to live nearby. It&#39;s a very tedious non-automated process that, again, takes ages.<br><br>In our town we have ones that are electronically opened with a card. How often it&#39;s clogged, depends on the model/version, but even with the newer ones we have it happens a lot (again, at least once every 14 days). The video shows bins that don&#39;t have these electronic card, maybe those are more reliable.<br><br>All in all, they really need to improve upon their design, allow for a bigger opening, fool-proof system that doesn&#39;t clog, and is much faster to unload.<br><br>BTW, they only use them in the town centers in The Netherlands, outside of the city center everyone still has a regular big garbage bin of their own."

The way they announce their arrival is by literally shouting &quot;kunuuu&quot; which translates to &quot;garbage&quot;.

Blind People Do Stuff,2022-05-03T04:30:10Z,2022-05-03T04:30:10Z,0,Kind of like living in an apartment where you can walk out of your apartment and go to the trash room and put it there down the hatch. These are really cool though. They’re just not getting picked up at your house. That’s the major difference.
A Tay,2022-04-30T09:01:57Z,2022-04-30T09:01:57Z,0,Quite similar to Singapore. Most of the new apartments have a chute at each floor where you can throw garbage that is collected in a massive container on the first floor. The trucks comes once every few days (I think) to collect from the central container.

If you live in a smaller city or in a rural area, you still have garbage day and those large bins animals can get into, in fact there’s a calendar for the different days of the month where different types of garbage are picked up (green, paper, restafval or basically generic trash, and in some places plastic separately too)."
Thomas Joosten,2022-04-20T17:14:41Z,2022-04-20T17:14:41Z,1,"I should note here that this isn&#39;t exactly how it works everywhere in the Netherlands. Here in my small city in the province of Limburg we still have bins and garbage trucks going down the streets on specific days. It&#39;s not like that&#39;s rare, a lot of places still have that system. However, I do think the majority of places have these sorts of communal bins for glass; there is one very close to my house that we can just drop the glass into. There are also big bins next to it for like, clothing and the like as well I think. I will say, there are also general bins in our city center that work kind of similar, but those are a bit smaller and are clearly not intended for household garbage, more to keep the city clean. Still though, way better than the USA."

I’m not saying it’s not a good idea and that I wouldn’t implement if I had the choice, it’s just that I don’t make decisions, the government does, and they don’t like to spend that much money. <br><br>On top of that, many of these European cities like Amsterdam are high value tourist destinations and thus make a lot of money off of tourism, and also have more reason to clean up the streets on account of rubbish turning away that sweet sweet tourist revenue. I’m simply saying this because I can’t imagine this ever being implemented where I live in Brisbane, because unlike Amsterdam which is about 220 square kilometres of civil responsibility, Brisbane is 15,000. And I don’t exactly think Brisbane is really up there in terms of “historically valuable, beautiful architecture, so much culture” tourist destinations. <br><br>Personally I hate the urban sprawl of Australian cities and think that small, dense, self governing communities are superior in so many ways, but my point is that there’s a reason Amsterdam has the ability to make all these revolutionary civil decisions."

And the pick-up equipment could not operate on streets where wires are hanging above ground, or where trees would be an obstacle. Trees already have enough enemies as it is."

In Paris they even have stupid bins at roadsides or in parks that have no shell, so when rats inevitably break the flimsy plastic bags, the plastic garbage flies everywhere. Plus you get the pleasure of noticing how rat infested Paris really is. In Hamburg the strong north sea winds will blow around and tear open the garbage that people place on the sidewalk when its waiting for the garbage trucks. The streets were full of small plastic shreds flying everywhere the last time i was there. Terrible! glad you made this video. In my danish city the garbage is kept in the backyard of the multi storey apartments, the garbage men go there to pick it up meaning whenever garbage falls outside and flies around its our problem and it stays in the backyard instead of flying around in the streets. But its more work for the garbage men, i wonder what system is more cost effective?"
Massimo Neri,2022-01-09T01:44:02Z,2022-01-09T01:44:02Z,0,"You completely missed the point, here. We always had big communal bins at the end of the street pretty much everywhere in Europe (some of them underground and some of them above the ground). In recent years, governments and local authorities have shifted to small private bins. Small bins encourage recycling. The volume of the bin is your weekly quota of trash and if you exceed it you have to store the trash somewhere else. Moreover, countries like Italy are starting to experiment with very strict quotas: pretty much everything has to be recycled and you have few bags <b>*per year*</b> of unrecyclable trash. If you recycle too little, you&#39;ll consume all your quota and have to call the council to get the mixed trash taken (and pay for the service). All of this starts with small and private bins for each household."

Many obvious solutions have been done across Europe and it feels like we are always trying to reinvent the wheel.

fr89k,2021-11-19T07:02:58Z,2021-11-19T07:02:58Z,0,"In Munich, we also have a similar system and it sucks hard. The reasons are: 1) The containers have a size, so that they are almost guaranteed full, when the garbage truck comes. The result is that in weeks where people have lots of trash (by coincidence), the containers are massively overflowing. Then you can either be a dick and pour your garbage also besides the container or take it back home - or as I also did once, throw the plastic waste into the container for residual waste. After all a lot of plastics is not recyclable anyways. However, I think due to this the plastic recycling percentage is very low in Munich. 2) I don&#39;t have my plastic waste in bags, because it&#39;s stupid to buy and use bags only to throw them away. I have my plastic waste in a plastic box. However, when it&#39;s windy outside, it&#39;s virtually impossible to go to the container with the box without some light plastic being blown away. Even if you used a lid, you still get the problem once you open the box to empty it into the container. Also, due to the small hole in the container, I have to touch each and every item again and potentially have dirty stinky finger afterwards. In the city where I lived before, we had 1100l containers that could be fully opened. There, I can just open it and pour everything from the box into the container without touching it. If there is some wind shielding around, this even works nicely on windy days... I am not saying that the system is generally useless, but in Munich the implementation is just shit..."

For example, maintaining and emptying rubbish bins costs what it means to lose money, so how is it dealt with?<br><br>In Finland, for money saving, rubbish bins have been outsourced to private companies from which cities then rent rubbish bins for a limited period of time. Often only for the summer. In winter, rubbish bins are collected in warehouses and not brought back until late spring. Therefore, in the winter, people are encouraged to carry their own rubbish home instead of dropping the rubbish on the street. It doesn’t work perfectly, but it gets cheaper than keep public rubbish bins all year round. It has also been suggested that in the future, rubbish bins will operate like vending machines, so that the cap of the bin will only open by paying. This would further reduce the cost of rubbish bins."

SpaghettiTF2,2021-11-16T04:06:54Z,2021-11-16T04:06:54Z,0,I personally don&#39;t feel any negativity towards the bin system in Toronto as it is something that takes 2 minutes a week which you can easily just slot that time whenever you leave and come back from work. As for the raccoons my area used to have a lot but I usually just left a brick on top of it and they left it alone. The wheels on the bins I felt were big and good at going up and down steps. When they were emptied they were very light and easy to take up and downs steps and you could basically carry it just trying to drag it up steps because of the weight. A huge flaw with the system however was the weekly alternating schedule of garbage and recycling pickup as if you missed a garbage day you&#39;d have to wait 2 weeks. Something similar happened where one of the garbage bags was wedged into the bottom therefore not being emptied and made us have an extra bag of garbage laying around for 2 weeks in the bin.  <br>A question: In Amsterdam do they use dumpsters for apartments and other residential buildings in a similar way that Toronto does it?
Bob Smith,2021-11-16T04:03:29Z,2021-11-16T04:03:29Z,0,"Looks really expensive to implement, just to save you the trouble of wheeling your garbage out to the curb, once a week. Plus, there&#39;s the issue of how far apart they place these. I can just imagine them putting in one per neighborhood, and then having to walk a mile to empty your garbage.<br><br>Also, these recepticals look pretty complex with a lot of moving parts and electronics. What happens when one breaks down? Just throw your garbage on the street?<br><br>This is the kind of idea that sounds like a good idea on paper, but would be horrible to implement. It may work in Amsterdam, but it would be a huge failure, in America, with the beaurocrats running it."

Like…say…a conveyor system underground like how we have underground subway tunnels all over the city. Reason I say this is because NYC traffic is insane, and between the buses and taxis that already flood the streets amongst the regular 9-5’ers and tourists…garbage trucks take up a lot of space and only add to the pile-ups. NYC also has a really bad littering problem because in NYC it’s very common to overflow your can and just try to stuff it in because of how many people are in one area. A system like this, but given extra accommodations like a compactor that webs up the square of compacted trash before sending it to a processing plant underground could be instrumental in cleaning up the streets and limiting unneeded traffic clutter. NYC is always under construction, so it wouldn’t be crazy to add this to the mix."

No trains evolved just the tunnel network.  Just put you rubbish in a bin that moves it to the dump etc. The sale of the trucks might cover the costs. Less fuel being used so more profit. The pipe network would have to be very well designed so blockages or diseases dont build up. Also pests would also be reduced in these pipes I.e. rats,ticks etc."

Laurence Vasquez,2021-11-14T20:45:41Z,2021-11-14T20:45:41Z,5,I don&#39;t know if this would work in my city. Most people leave their trash on the tables that they eat at or just drop their trash on the ground wherever they are at. It doesn&#39;t matter to them that a trash can is two or three SUV lengths away. I think it is because these people want to inconvenience others that come after them.

The underground dumpsters have receptacles smaller than common garbage bags, so you need to cram your garbage into it with force. Sometimes bags burst, so these hightech underground dumpsters are surrounded by heaps of rotting trash that didn&#39;t fit in.<br><br>The old dumpsters had a sliding lid that opened to a 1 by 1.5 meter opening, you could throw in a 100 liter bag once a week. Now we need to use smaller bags (30-40 liter) and go more often (so more plastic bags, more time spent).<br><br>The old dumpsters could be picked up and emptied by the garbage truck inside of 20 seconds. The underground one needs a crane and a crew of men guiding it with rods, and it takes 1-2 minutes each. Every Tuesday morning is a race to beat the garbage truck, because it clogs the one-way street for 20+ minutes."

Granted, I never lived in a big city and we don&#39;t have raccoons here. But in towns/cities, you don&#39;t have your own garbage bin. The neighborhood or the building you live in will have them and you don&#39;t have to worry about them. And there are dedicated recycling areas around the city.<br><br>Another thing I&#39;d like to mention is that we get money when we return the bottles and cans back to the shops. 0.15€ from cans 0,10€/0,20€/0,40€ from bottles. That amount is already included in the product price, but we can get it back. There are machines in the shops that you put them in and it gives you a ticket that you can turn into money or use it to buy something. The bottles and cans are then recycled and reused.

Curious to know how well they&#39;d hold up to freezing temperatures that might freeze the bins to the ground when it gets particularly cold.

Instead, we have these huge garbage containers outside which we throw our trash into. Kinda like in Amsterdam, except not underground and no recycling (even when there is a place for that, it&#39;s hard to say how much is actually recycled). Then these containers are emptied out every day or almost every day depending on the place. In the past we also had garbage chutes to which you had access on every floor of the building. You would basically throw your trash there and it would travel to the container. Now there are almost no places that have them working, but still. <br>Plus we have this tradition that if you are throwing away some furniture or books you can just leave them outside the container and someone else might take them. <br>Anyway, it was really interesting to learn how you take out your trash in other countries :) I never thought that it could be so different!"

It gets to be a disgusting, stinking mess during the summer, especially when the underground bin is over full and it takes a week for the company to be scheduled to empty it with their very expensive crane service.<br><br>After breaking these unions, the city now spends more for the same results given the amount of workers it takes now to both keep up the parks and the patrols of ticket writers plus the revenue influx for the initial conversion.<br><br>Perhaps it works if you do it for the &#39;right reasons&#39; and you have the people buy-in first but I think the main difference here is the availability to the user so inconvenience does not become an issue."
Martin Budinský,2021-11-13T18:50:50Z,2021-11-13T18:50:50Z,0,Let me correct you a bit. Amsterdam still HAS a garbage day. Only difference is what they pickup on said day (the underground containers) and your involvement in it. In my country (Czechia) we have both. These underground containers in densely populated areas (mostly where people live in flats) and normal bins that you take out in less densely populated areas (usually one per house). And I am pretty sure that its the same in Netherlands. I doubt in some smaller villages or towns there will be underground containers. For more than one practical reason.

Not Loki,2021-11-13T09:25:40Z,2021-11-13T09:25:40Z,0,"This makes sense in cities, especially if you have less rain and proper infrastructure for water dissipation. Another one I saw in my country was on hydraulics. The truck would connect to the top feeder and raise the whole platform while in the enclosure you had a classic larger bin (like the ones you see in American movies behind a restaurant for example).<br><br>The technology is not amazing, but the reason why it&#39;s not being done here in the UK for example, is due to how many people per square km you have. It would make no sense to have one of these just to service 20 households or so due to most of the country living in houses instead of apartment buildings. Also would not justify the cost of building and maintaining them. The underground is often used for other stuff, like electrical and gas pipes, not to mention the drainage system. Finding a spot for these would be a challenge when most space that does not have a building on it, is privately owned."

Also we have one more thing machines which collect glass and plastic bottles in every bigger or smaller market which pays you beck money. It works like this you must pay 10cents for glass and plastic bottle than you use it you go beck to shop where you bought it and feed into machine same bottle it has barcode it scans, it gives you checkout than you can either go to store and use it or get beck in cash in same store.

Not sure how it is in all the areas but where I live there are a few garbage cans on nearby corners that you dump your trash in and they pick it up. Recycling is not common here and I have to drive to drop off my recyclables when they accumulate. But they don&#39;t accept foam, cans from canned food, or glass. For the glass I found a specific hardware store to bring it to where they make construction bricks out of crushed glass and cement. My main concern is what happens to the trash when they pick it up. I know there are landfills here but that&#39;s a crappy solution also. We need to reduce waste. Period."

BoogerBeardPirate,2021-10-31T12:33:59Z,2021-10-31T12:33:59Z,0,So ur saying I have to take my trash and walk it down the street ? That makes no sense it does sound trivial. Seems like to much work for me …I like my garbage day … … and for the trash pandas u can build a box for ur trash bins so the buggers don’t get in or they have these Devices that u can buy that keeps them away and it works real good

jtland,2021-10-19T22:51:54Z,2021-10-19T22:52:35Z,0,"Sadly there are probably some hidden benefits to keeping our stupid bin system. Americans as a whole, we love to buy an absurd amount of cheap crap that breaks and goes in the landfill. In my eyes, one positive is that the size of the garbage bins that each household has, can be a legitimate deterrent to buying more stuff. I have heard my parents actually being up the point of having more garbage/recycling than could be put in the bin this week as a reason to not buy something. I doubt most people actually have this problem especially where it matters with trash since most people I know actually have this problem with recycling. Since our recycling system is so backed up and inefficient, there are indirect incentives to recycle less, like weirdly small recycling bins. A couple of years ago when I was spending my Christmas holiday in Houston, Texas, they actually stopped picking up recycling as a whole around that time since the amount of boxes from the holiday was so immense, they had to pause accepting any more recycling to have their facilities get through what they already had."

The containers that compress the garbage, also press open bags, and all the juices of rotting veggies and meat and diapers will mix. Some of these containers can be smelled from within the homes nearby, or businesses like restaurants. <br><br>Then there are all these people walking to the container and, if they are full, just dumping it next to it. The result then is that the guy who wants to empty the container can&#39;t do it because he would first need to shuffle all the other garbage away, before he can pull the container out.<br><br>I reckon there must be smarter, cheaper ways to solve the same thing. This &quot;improvement&quot; was surely well sold by the industry, but not thought through properly."

On my regular daily dog walks, I walk past about half a dozen public bins. These bins are near bus stops or are in public parks and are intended for people&#39;s lunch wrappers, dog poo etc... However people come down in the middle of the night and cram household waste like televisions, microwaves, old TV cabinets chopped up or even just the excess waste from a big party they couldn&#39;t fit in their own bins.<br>Love the idea... But Dutch people by nature are a lot less selfish than Australians. I&#39;ve been to The Netherlands several times and have always been taken back by how nice and friendly everyone is. I think this system works because Dutch people tend to care about their community."

In both cases, we never need worry about garbage day. We just empty our rubbish into a communal bin outside our apartment. It&#39;s a large bin (and in both countries we have separate bins for recycling) and at some point, whenever it is (I have no idea, although it is a scheduled day - we really don&#39;t need to know which day) a truck comes and empties the communal bins. Simple. Of course, this is because we are in apartments."

This system of underground containers works fine in a dencely populated city as Amsterdam, but not in a less dence populated neighbourhood. Let me explain. I live in a small town called Vaassen in the Netherlands. De municipality wanted to introduce the same system as in Amsterdam. But because Vaassen is less dencely populated as Amsterdam, the locations of the underground containers are further apart. For most people a walk Of 200 -300 m With a garbagebag is not problem. But if you are less able, a walk of 300 m With  a garbagebag is quite a thing. And you have to do this 4-5 Times a week. Rolling out the thrashbin to the edge of the side walk is only weekly routine. If you are less able, a Neighbour is often willing tot help. Bringing trash to a container 4-5 Times a week to a container 300 m away is bigger burden for the Neighbour. So I and most of my fellow citizens in Vaassen prefer the trashbins as we have now."

Granted they are quite common, but still, they could have made them larger and with wider openings to accommodate larger thrash. Anytime I get a slightly bigger cardboard box I have to shred it manually back at home into little pieces because I know it won’t fit in the bin. IMO it’s simpler, and relatively better to have a garbage disposal cellar locked by key. To me this is a good example of over-engineering."

Many comments point out bulk garage systems in multi-unit living. This solution isn&#39;t  ideal when new multi-unit buildings can incorporate bulk garbage solutions more cost effective  and more  convenient. Can&#39;t compare this to suburbs. In our city, garbage trucks have highly an automated arm that single driver/operater picks up bins. It is quick and easy. Looking at the effort to remove one underground bin, it didn&#39;t look  quick and easy. Also what  is the maintenance costs?? Looks costly. Again looks to work in that application. Sure cost is buried in taxes and other fees. Since costs are buried, feels good to residents and other users."

We weren&#39;t allowed to put the cans out before that time. If we did we got a $50 fine. It only worked when the trash people came on time. When they didn&#39;t the animals would have a field day.

Yes these containers are typical if you live in apartment building or in a dense area. However most places do have trash day, the day when you have to wheel out the trash containers, which everyone keeps in their back or front yard, to the designated trash pick up areas.<br><br>Many districts in Amsterdam still have trash day especially areas with normal family homes, and not full of shitty over priced apartments that are full off smug expats like this dude in the video.

Not only do you control your own waste when placed into your own bin you never over flow it. I imagine using public dumpsters causes people to dump all sorts of excess crap into them Oh but wait the clever Dutch made the bins really difficult to put anything larger than a small bag in the bin causing you to make trips every day. Yea Toronto spent a lot but I bet installing large trash compacting bins underground and then extracting them with a crane to empty them costs a lot more. I&#39;m sorry but I enjoy the freedom of putting my trash into my own bins, my truck comes once a week picks up the garbage and is gone in 20 seconds. Maybe this works in high density living where you would use big dumpsters anyway but not in suburbia."

Also I lived in Toronto all my life and if you can’t follow a calendar the city provides I think you may have other things to worry about. As far as raccoons go ensure you turn the lid to lock position

Garbage trucks were usually multi-purpose trucks with a hook used to bring up and down large containers so they can either transport them to a client or use them to collect recyclables from the bells using the hydraulic crane that the truck was equipped with. The crane had 2 hooks, one was used to lift the bells, and the other, with adjustable chain lenght was used to pull the opening pin out. <br>At this time these are very rare sight to see, bcs it&#39;s much easier and practical to empty out 1,1 bins with standard rear loader trucks or frontloaders"

First of all, you were really limited in the size of things you could put in there. Anything bigger than a large shoebox and you&#39;re out of luck. Secondly, they would fill up pretty quickly. Thirdly, guess what happens when you have people handle machinery which handles garbage? It becomes really disgusting. People end up wearing gloves to touch the thing because it&#39;s so gross. Then there&#39;s the issue when the thing is full or when the machine breaks. Some people had to walk 50 years with their trash bags, on the public street. When they got to the underground containers and they were full or not working or the bags wouldn&#39;t fit, they would just leave them there. The whole area around the trash chute got really gross and smelled horribly and would have a ton of bugs. But by far the worst thing was when the truck would come by to empty the thing. First of all, it&#39;s incredibly loud. It would wake up the whole block in the early morning, second, it would spill some of the trash and leak all kinds of garbage fluids, and the smell was the worst, especially in the summer. Sometimes my whole apartment would smell because of it. So no, not a huge fan. I&#39;ll take a regular garbage day any day."

Luke Silbey,2021-10-10T07:23:45Z,2021-10-10T07:23:45Z,0,Yeah problem is when they do get full (which happens often) people just leave garbage bags next to them and they pile up. This is a weekly occurrence and 1 day per week you can have large piles of garbage just sitting outside next to these bins. Kinda dirty. But overall it’s a good system. They’re working on it.

Nope, its forbidden. Would you like to Housing expenses are also very high when it comes to rent/price per square meter. Getting permits to personalize or expand your house is also almost impossible. Cars + cartax + petrol is also unpayable. Like, the cars are twice the price of germany&#39;s equivalents, even when we are huge trade partners and neighbours.

Few Americans would favor the tax increases the municipal governments would need to implement such a system.  Also, there would need to be statewide level coordination because a uniform disposal system would be needed for all towns across a state.  No state municipalities are willing to share that kind of power, so poorer communities would vote NO on any such spending proposal.  <br><br>&quot;How dare other people make us spend money we don&#39;t have&quot;, would be the complaint.  Then to make it fair, rich municipalities would need to be taxed more to shoulder the cost which they will complain about as well.  <br><br>In short, Americans do not tolerate being forced to make personal sacrifices for the greater good.

Although I think it&#39;s a nice idea, and one that I swear has existed for ages in apartment blocks and was seen on TV shows like friends, I think the normal bins they use in UK are perfectly fine and much easier to use and wheel out for emptying, my only complaint is some bins look horrible and dirty but this is easily fixed by cleaning them semi regularly :)"

Well for the town were I am living we have a 3 bins in our garden 1 for Paper which is being collected 1 time every 4 weeks, then we have a bin for plastic which is also collected 1 time every 4 weeks and depending of the period 2 (Winter/autumn)  to 4 times (Summer/Spring) every 4 weeks (Vegetables, Fruit and garden waste), and that is not on the same day, so every week I need to role a bin out on to the pavement so it will be emptied, Oh yes the rest of the crap goes in a container in the street like in this movie, that is only for the small stuff and some places in The Netherlands they even weigh the stuff you put in and you get a bill for it. Also when 1 of those street containers is full or malfunctioning , you can most of the time bring it to another street container, but like most of the lazy Dutch they just dump their bag next to the container and leave it there for someone else to get rid of it."

And aren&#39;t in a small enclosed space with only some wonky super sensitive electronics which need to work well for the mission to succeed, its failure landing on the scale from &quot;the data&#39;s useless&quot; to &quot;you died&quot;.

Obviously the first thing I noticed was the mob of bicycles. The second thing I noticed was the piles upon piles of trash and garbage bags and that the city smelt of piss. I don’t know if this was because of Sunday night parties and or that everyone just drops off their garbage on Monday mornings, but there was a massive overload and these bins must have been overloaded. There was also garbage floating in the river. It smelled like piss because they have outdoor urinals or something. Basically a spiral barricade where men can walk into and piss into a drain in the stone floor. Disgusting.<br><br>Anyways my impression of the city was that it was filthy, stunk of piss and there were prostitutes everywhere on a Monday morning at 10:00 am."

How close on average are these garbage drop offs to homes. The elderly or people with movement disabilities will obviously struggle to walk/travel a decent distance carrying rubbish and I would assume the more traditional wheelie bin left at the front of the house is generally easier for these people? Is there an option for traditional collection methods for these people? Or are the drop off really close?

Only the bins were on the surface and served 5-10 houses each, emptied on a regular basis. They were taken away in 2014, when the city went to a unified system of wheeled garbage and recycling carts that you have to put out weekly on garbage day. Yard waste is also collected every other garbage day during spring, summer, and fall, but you have to provide the bags. Apartments and townhouse complexes have their own, private systems. We also have 3 central depots where you can drop off your waste. And before covid, there were two giveaway weekends per year where you could put reusable unwanted items out to the curb for anyone who wanted to take."

Trucks which empty them are really noisy (and for some reason they empty them late in the day).<br>2. it takes ages to empty containers which blocks traffic in narrow streets<br>3. if traffic is blocked it gets even nosier because of the other cars and the constant honking<br>4. Recently it seems like some trucks broke and they didn&#39;t empty containers for days it was very smelly because they really need specialized trucks to empty the containers.<br>5. When we get sudden torrential rainfalls the containers get flooded and trash ends up all over the street. (this is rare but still super unhygienic)<br>6. This point depends on container type but some lids are super loud when they are closed because they use system where they are opened by stepping on metal bar which opens the lid and when you release the bar, the lid it just smashes down. (Well in theory they have mechanism which is supposed to slow down the last part of the closing but they always break)<br><br>I might be forgetting even more problems with the containers, and while the ones in the videos seem bit better when it comes to some of the points, it still doesn&#39;t solve issue with need for specialized trucks which are slow and noisy."

The trash bin is now completely full and we&#39;ve still got more trash to take out, plus we share the bin with our neighbor (we live in a duplex). I need to take all the cardboard out to the curb too, but at least that was always going to go next to the bin. At least our trash is picked up once a week here.<br><br>For those wondering about recycling, all of it is collected by the trash ppl at the same time and then the county hires ppl to sort the trash into recycling, what can be burned, and what has to go to a landfill. Frankly, I prefer it to having to sort out recycling myself. Plus, I&#39;ve never lived anywhere that the landlord pays for recycling collection anyway (in a different county where that would actually matter), so I would have to take my recycling to the recycling center myself - which wasn&#39;t along any bus lines so I had to drive to get there."

I think in most of Utrecht, there&#39;s still garbage day, but only for green garbage. &#39;Big&#39; garbage bins are for house owners, I think that the flat people only have a really small one, but I don&#39;t see those on the street that much. The rest goes in those underground bins. There are more garbage bins for the remainder garbage, but the others aren&#39;t too far away either. I seperate the garbage for the underground bins inside and every now and then I use my bike to take it away. <br>There are loads of people here that put stuff next to the underground bins that doesn&#39;t even fit in the bins. That is not allowed but if there&#39;s no proof of from whom it&#39;s from, what can they really do? For stuff like old furniture (not electronics), you can make an appointment with the goverment so that they can come pick it up. There are also some places where you can bring things that you can&#39;t fit in those containers (off course not everyone has a car or can get help). <br>Despite there being a lot of underground bins, there&#39;s also a lot of garbage just laying around in the street. I&#39;ve seen one guy just empty out his car at the street and then drive off. The bins in my area can be opened without a pass. Years back, you needed to open it with a pass. But still some people seem to be too lazy to take it to an underground place down the street."

You just throw your trash into the bin and the garbage collectors pick it up at some day which you don&#39;t have to worry about.

Christopher Hay,2021-06-15T22:08:39Z,2021-06-15T22:08:39Z,1,The government spends millions on trying to clean up the country but never gets anywhere well if they just spent the money on something like this then it would benifit everyone clean streets and smelling fresh and would stop wildlife eating or getting tangled in our rubbish and would probably help endangered species as well
heylo232,2021-06-15T21:57:36Z,2021-06-15T21:57:36Z,2,"This is one of those solutions that sounds like a great idea, but would have trouble being implemented in the majority of other places like the United States. Might work fine for cities, sure. But with so many people living in suburbs and single family detached housing, you’d need one of these underground vaults for at least every two houses. Because no way are people walking farther than that to throw away their trash haha."

"Megalobst,UMU",2021-06-15T20:59:15Z,2021-06-15T20:59:15Z,26,"Since this an old video of NJB let me point out that these containers are :<br>1. Its in 1min walking distance or 1 to streets away (streets are smaller in the netherlands and more dense)<br>2. He points out in a newer video referencing this one, the containers are always available, which means instead of waiting for the trash bin to be collected you just walk like 10/20 steps further to throw your trash into the container(if you unlucky and the container is not next to your house)<br>3. Because of (2.) your trash wont sit around there so less chance of animals in your trash (never experienced that myself).<br>4. Trash is collected in one container that serves like 10-100+ households (depending on types of households, apartments to standalone homes) making the collection of waste much easier, faster and efficient. (And since these programs are funded by taxes, not wasted taxes)"

There are 4 rubbish categories and in some regions if you live in a house you will get either 3 or 4 bins. Sometimes there could be 3 bins and then an underground collection container like the ones you show for the 4th category. If the residential area has apartment buildings then it&#39;s just underground containers and each resident gets a wireless key. Now there are more than 4 categories of rubbish so if you need to throw away Styrofoam or metal or any other material, you have in each area a Rubbish Division Station in a drive in style where you will have at least 15 to 25 rubbish categories."

Silver,2021-06-12T11:30:17Z,2021-06-12T11:30:17Z,0,"Those have become common in urban parts of Norway too, as overground trash containers are big, ugly and smelly. <br>Even cooler is a suction system, that looks similar overground. Underground the trash from multiple places gets sucked into one larger underground container. A special garbage truck comes when that container is full and sucks it all up. This saves having to go to every individual trash dropoff spot, allowing them to be built in places where one don&#39;t want traffic, like between apartment buildings. It also limits smell.<br><br>In non-urban areas the bin is still most common. As we don&#39;t have trash pandas it is not as much of a problem, and a simple strap, big rock or a shed will keep the birds of. Not all trash collectors allows sheds on garbage day, but asking never hurts."

Instead, we have to take our rubbish to a collection point, about twelve kilometres from our property, where there are several large skips, which are emptied twice a week. Thankfully, we don&#39;t have trash pandas. Just poisonous snakes and spiders."

North American systems are designed to handle way more volume.<br>What would&#39;ve been nice, is slow-combusting trash incinerator; finally leading to a pick-up by a truck.  it would probably be gas, and then electric fired. <br>the Smoke particles would have to be dry-filtered, using centrifugal/electric forces and finally a rough filter.<br>Doing it this way, makes for much tidier environment.  Recycling would have to be separate - if it can be monetized, even better.<br>In terms of Green-ecology, the governments should off-set with tree planting, and pneumatic wind-turbines, to &#39;fuel&#39; a hydrogen-electric economy; high-speed rail, smaller vehicles (large fuel tanks)...etc."

I.E. people can&#39;t even return a shopping cart in a parking lot because its &quot;inconvenient&quot;. Some Complexes/Apartment/shared living spaces offer trash services where you can place your trash-bag in front of your front door between certain hours and an employee of the property management will come around and gather your trash, yet people continue to place their trash all over the complex, or at their door outside of the defined hours. That&#39;s literally as simple as it can possible get, so in comparison to walking your bag all the way down to a public sidewalk is far beyond what the average American is willing to invest effort in doing.

Good idea if there was one right near your house but at the bottom of your road everytime you change a bin bag thats just ludicrous! and that would be worse for large families who have to change the bin more often.

Or all the trimmings from the trees do I need to cut them all down to 6 inch pieces to fit or how about all the apples that fall from my tree on a daily basis in the summer do I walk them down everyday? No it&#39;s easier and way better just to have a bin next to the driveway to throw all that crap into how is a bin down the block better???

Dan Wilcox,2021-06-10T01:06:14Z,2021-06-10T01:06:14Z,0,"At my apartment in Tulsa, Oklahoma I have to walk about one third of a city block to drop my trash in the dumpster.  Every time I am there I make sure to lift up the lid and leave it open otherwise the residents here have about a 50% chance of leaving their garbage on the ground outside the dumpster.  If Americans had to carry their garbage three or four city blocks that 50% of humanity here who will not lift the heavy dumpster lid would be dumping it on peoples lawns, in front of businesses, in the street...  I would appreciate a system where identity thieves were not digging through each trash dumpster about 500 to 1,000 times per year.  It is literally that bad here.  The trash pickup system for residential houses does have the advantage of incentivizing people to reduce their trash output so they can get by with the smaller cheaper trash bins."

Also some places don’t allow you to have the trash cans showing unless it’s trash day. Also wouldn’t it be more work for the garbage men to need to lift these big cans into a truck. It seems like more work but that’s a super cool way to do trash and easier (besides for the workers)

We had to go outside to the bins, pretty close, but still, would have been more convenient with a garbage chute. Sometimes they didnt work, and sometimes they were full and I had to take my garbage back inside.. Then I moved to a house. Now I have my garbage bins just outside the door. They are mine and if they are full its my own fault. There are no troubles with any animals getting in to my garbage bins, and Its just SO much more convenient to have it just outside the door."

You wish to know why recycling and garbage fails in America and Canada? Because we pay for it and the companies who provide the service are in it to make a profit and provide stocks. meanwhile in AHMsterdam you pay more taxes which provide for that service. A prime example of recyclables in California is you get this tiny fucking tub that barely holds 30 crushed aluminum cans and are expected to put ALL your recyclables into it the not to mention you are paying for this &quot;service&quot; with no kick back on the value of the recycled material. Putting giant &quot;kiosks&quot; fixed this somewhat then the cities that put out the kiosks got tired of homeless people breaking into their kiosks so they removed them...hmm who&#39;d think that the cities were making money off something people were giving them for free and then bitching about people who had no money &quot;stealing&quot; their free money. The problem comes down to American and Canadian cities being run by idiots who do not understand how to run a city properly and think of  garbage and a hinderance and not a service...unless it makes them free money to which they will go to any lengths to keep.

However, in my experience, they are still riddled by unwanted visitors - not crows or raccoons, but by wasps! It gets crazy in the spring and fall. I find the indoor trash rooms in dorms and apartment buildings to be very useful for the people living in these buildings (you don&#39;t even have to worry about going outside!). But having also grown up in a household, I do also dread having to take out the trash every Tuesday."

Some weeks I completely overflow my bin and some weeks I have barely anything in it at all, I have to pay extra if I overfill my bin too much but get no discount for being nearly empty. Every Monday morning (our garbage day) I have to do the mental math on whether or not to take out the not full trash bag in the kitchen because this week the bin has a lot of extra space, but next week it might not. So much less stressful to just empty it when full."

The bins are large to accomodate for the whole buildings trash, you just grab your trashbag and walk it outside to the bin. The lids are heavy enough that no city animal will be able to open it but a child would. Its designed to be easily picked up by the garbage truck and since it sits by the road, it literaly takes them less than 5 minutes to empty all of them.<br>Honestly, I feel like having them underground just overcomplicates things for no reason. It would be harder to replace them, harder to maintain them, and you need specialized trucks to pick the trash up."

I can&#39;t believe the residents of Toronto put their bins out a week before pick up?  That seems so dumb. I&#39;m not sure that the Dutch system is that good.  Having to pick up your garbage and take it to a community garbage dump doesn&#39;t sound too hygienic to me.....especially if that container is right in front of your home. The collectors must have some scheduled arrangements to pick up, so there really is a pick up day isn&#39;t there?"
DuhDuh,2021-06-06T23:46:53Z,2021-06-06T23:46:53Z,2,but that means you have to carry and bring your trash to these containers? I barely walk out to get my mail! and that&#39;s only 20 seconds away!

The paper/cardboard gets torched about every 2 weeks, and the ash goes in the compost pile. The actual garbage goes just down the street to the &quot;dump&quot;, which is more of a transfer station with a giant dumpster/compactor. Free to use, open 7 days a week. Don&#39;t have to go to the dump very often, food waste normally gets thrown out into the yard through the window where it is always gone by morning.<br><br>The fancy people can still pay to have a can picked up, but it&#39;s not very common.

We had to buy a second garbage cart because of our volume, at $75 and wait a month to get it.  And woe betide if your lid is open even one inch; they refuse to take your garbage, leaving it to sit in the Florida sun and marinate another week.  After one hurricane a freezer&#39;s worth of food sat in the cart for 2 weeks and the stink was monumental.  And, you have to know which week is yard trash and which is household bulk trash, and if you get it wrong there it sits.  Unless of course you haul it back off the curb and store it.  Our so-called recycling is a joke.  They won&#39;t take glass, they don&#39;t want boxes broken down, and what they do take is baled and left sitting in a former landfill.  Before Waste Connections took over and we had to pay $175/yr for piss-poor service, we had twice a week pickup and MUCH better service.  But this is our county commission&#39;s idea of &quot;progress&quot;.  Progress SUCKS!"

Recycling is done in the same fashion as in the Netherlands and there is usually always one nearby."

Luc René de Cotret,2021-06-06T08:11:34Z,2021-06-06T08:11:34Z,1,"While I agree that this system offers an elegant solution to keep the streets free of the clutter of bins and bags full of smelly waste, there’s one thing you haven’t mentionned in your video: how is this paid for?<br><br>Everywhere I’ve lived, the cities imposed taxes for garbage collection. I’ve seen different systems to finance this operation. Some cities impose quotas, where you pay a fixed amount per year and you’re either allowed a certain volume of bags per pickup (or one bin per household), or a limited number of pickups per year, or limited to a certain total weight of waste collected (bins have microchips and your waste is weighed on pickup). Anything exceeding the defined quota will result in a surcharge at the end of the year.<br><br>Other cities have you pay proportionally for what you put out by having you put your waste in official bags which cost a ton (this is how the taxes are collected in this scenario). The more you sort, reuse and recycle, the less you’ll need to pay. Throwing away household garbage in public bins is prohibited as those are not subject to any of these forms of control. You can be severely fined for bringing a bag out of your home and throwing it on the public bins intended for pedestrians to throw their chocolate wrappers and such.<br><br>In a system where garbage bins are in public space and shared by everyone, how can you pinpoint and make responsible people who fail to sort their trash, or throw away excessive amounts of waste? What’s in place to reward people for reducing their household waste by recycling more or composting? There don’t seem to be any forms of control on any of that. I can only image a per-capita or per-household fixed tax to handle the overall costs of the operation divided evenly. I’m not convinced this system will help reduce overall waste or improve sorting or adopting ecological behaviour. It just takes the garbage out of sight, and no one can actually tell how good or bad the situation is, and no one needs to take responsibility for being trash at sorting trash."

What does annoy me is when I moved to the countryside. In the French countryside, there were garbage dropoff points, with colour coded bins to drop the correct garbage in the right bin. In my county in Ontario, the garbage truck drives weekly to everyones rural street and collects garbage on the side of the road, which has to be tagged witha $4.25 tag, and god help if litter gets blown into the ditch or woodland before its picked up. Frankly it&#39;s the most annoying thing about living here imo, have to order these stupid tags only for some animal to tear up the bag."

You&#39;d have to lug kilos of rubbish to bins that would probably be 500 meters to a km away. We just don&#39;t live close enough together for this to be practical. Plus, because our blocks are bigger, we have lots of green rubbish (branches, leaves) which get composted along with your food. We have three bins: small red (for just rubbish: dirty nappies, unrecyclable plastics, stuff that can&#39;t be recycled nor composted), large yellow (for recycling; can&#39;t add soft plastics now though, need to go to your supermarket) and large green (composting food and plant materials).

We have similar bins but I think the recycling is every fortnight, the regular rubbish is every week and the green rubbish is once a month. You used to have to buy your own rubbish bins but a few years ago the government started paying for them and they came around and put stickers on everyone’s rubbish bins on rubbish days that had their address on them. We don’t really have any wildlife that get’s into the bins (maybe possums if you live in the bush) but the bins often get blown over by the wind on rubbish day."

Except it is over engineered and not convenient for anyone. I predict it will have all the same issues as those communal dumpsters. The area around the dumpster gets dirty when bags break or people drop things by accident. Also the dumpsters sometimes fill up and people have resort to putting trash on the street beside them.

I guess move where there are not raccoons? Also I cant think about having to take out small trash bags like that so often, it just seems tedious.

Roadrunner,2021-05-20T16:41:15Z,2021-05-20T16:41:15Z,43,"Heyo! Dutch sanitation worker here! I actually empty these for a living (though not in Amsterdam) here&#39;s a couple fun facts for those of you who are interested;<br><br>- The containers for glass, packaging, paper, and textiles are usually grouped together in so-called &#39;recycling islands&#39; or &#39;recycling streets&#39;. These containers are emptied on a shedule like mentioned in the video. Ideally, the truck comes by when the container is just about full.<br><br>-The &#39;waste&#39; containers (for non-recyclables) operate on a pay-per-click system, using a contactless household-bound smart card. The card opens the drum once, after which you can put a 60 or 30L bag in, and close it, which rotates the drum so the bag falls into the container.<br><br>-The container registers this action as one &#39;click&#39; and it knows how many clicks it can take before it&#39;s full. Once it&#39;s at about 60%, it sends a signal to HQ and gets put on the route for the next day. <br><br>-When the truck comes by to empty the waste containers, after putting it back into the ground, the worker will swipe a special badge over the container display, resetting the &#39;click counter&#39;.<br><br>-Using this system, the trucks only head out to 60-100% full containers, maximizing efficiency, and in our case, one truck is enough to cover 90.000 inhabitants on a 5-day 8-hour shedule.<br><br>-Containers can have many different mechanisms for lifting and discharging via truck-mounted crane! In the video, you see the so-called &quot;mushroom&quot; system, allowing the operator to empty the container and put it back into the pit, all without having to do ANY manual labor.<br><br>-Waste containers only need a small solar cell to power the locking mechanism and the click counter!<br><br>-Compactor containers like the one in the video are powered by a power supply that&#39;s mounted inside the pit. These containers have a screw compactor inside, and a laser tripwire that activates it when an x amount of bags have been dropped into the container!<br><br>-Depending on the company, area, and circumstances, crane trucks can empty between 50 and 120 containers per day! Trucks are typically operated by one person, who drives the truck to the various locations, gets out, and empties the containers via remote-control truck-mounted crane.<br><br>-Our trucks (like most in the business) have crane-mounted weighing systems, that can weigh a container in the air, once when full, and once when empty. This way, using geodata, the system knows which container we&#39;re loading based on our current location, and keeps track of the volume of each container when emptied. This data is then used to optimize routes, and move the emptying times backward or forward on the shedule as needed."

Lisa Nidog,2021-04-18T00:55:55Z,2021-04-18T00:58:35Z,0,We have in my block plastic wheeled garbage cans with tops. If you don&#39;t over fill like some the lid stays closed. I keep mine in the back yard and watch other people to know when to put my recycle can out.  Our garbage trucks are different now. A robotic arm takes the can and empties it. It&#39;s a better system of bigger wheeled lidded plastic garbage cans and garbage truck robotic arms than regular rubber garbage cans with flimsy lids because they don&#39;t blow away and the inconsiderate garbage men can&#39;t fling them all over the place like before by hand. The only problem is when they purposely pass you but pick up on either side of you then it takes them 6 hours to come back and do their job right.

Camille,2021-04-14T03:29:45Z,2021-04-14T03:29:45Z,0,"In France, we have both communal bins such as these, as well as ones in our buildings. I&#39;m not sure what people do when they have houses, because not many people do in cities, and then in smaller towns or villages, I don&#39;t know what the schedule for bin pick-up is. But in cities, apartment buildings will have a certain amount of general waste and recycling bins, which the company who is in charge of cleaning the building will take out when needed. The bins are usually in a closed space, next to the garage if there&#39;s one, and if there isn&#39;t, they&#39;ll be in a designated space everyone in the building can access, and which is usually sheltered in some way. I have no idea what the schedule is in my city, but I know the bins are usually picked up quite late at night or early in the morning, to avoid being in everyone else&#39;s way, unlike in Australia, where they come around during the day, which also means the bins stay outside all day long, often all night long too, cause people take them out the night before, as per councils&#39; recommendations. I love watching the big communal bins being emptied, I find it facisnating to see the massive metal box coming out of the ground (the ones where I&#39;m from are a lot bigger than the ones you&#39;ve shown, which is why it&#39;s fascinating to me). And when they empty the glass one, oh boy do you know it! It&#39;s very loud. Which is probably why they do it during the day for this one, cause it&#39;d wake up everyone in the neighbourhood otherwise!"

People actually died crawling into them to try and get free clothes then couldn&#39;t get out and were found a month later died when the bin was collected and emptied!
Patrick Wingert,2021-04-13T20:34:11Z,2021-04-13T20:34:11Z,0,"Garbage trucks are less fuel-efficient than an M1 Abrahams tank so the fewer stops it must make the less it costs to run. stopping and starting outside of every couple of houses across the city means it gets gallons per mile instead of miles per gallon! Apartment buildings are the worst. people put 55&quot; tv&#39;s into the organic recycling bin which means it is now contaminated and becomes ordinary garbage. Nothing is separated and 80% of the tenants just drop their garbage down the garbage shoot so recycling is only about 1`0% and 90% ends up in landfills. I love low-income people in Toronto social housing. If it doesn&#39;t involve getting drunk, fighting about money for crack, or trading girls like hockey cards to earn money from prostitution they don&#39;t care! Proper garbage and recycling separation is not even a slight consideration for them. It&#39;s the cities problem, let them go through the garbage and separate it out."

In the centre we don&#39;t have the space for underground bins because of the age of the city so they are allowed to throw trash bags on the sidewalk and we&#39;ll pick them up in trucks. And in outter suburbs like Nieuw West and Noord, they still use bins and we collect those normally with a route each day. There are also mixtures of both. For example north only had 1 or 2 bin crews. (That picked up bins) as most areas used underground containers like this. But areas like Nieuw West still used 4 to 6 bin trucks."

To keep the animals out, I just keep a dog leash hooked over the lid, except at pickup time.  <br><br>So far, no critters have ever gotten in.   Granted, this doesn&#39;t cover the several hours that the bins are roadside for pickup (as I have to remove the strap so the truck can robo-grab the bin and dump it), but that exposure is a tiny fraction of daylight hours and hasn&#39;t been an issue.<br><br>EDIT: I might actually prefer having the sort of centralized pickup documented in the video, but I live in a rural area.

After a few years people who work their get back and other problems.<br><br>This solution has so many benefits it should immediately replace our german garbage day system. I miss garbage day very often and you need more bins, more people with heavy work and it also saves space in your own house. Here you need at least 2-3m² from your house just for the trash bins. So you pay the trash bins, the square meter, the box they are in and we pay more cause the work takes more time and is harder."

Then that day is garbage day. :) there fixed it for you. Basically different countries have different methods of storing and picking up garbage.

Wheelie bins are not allowed to be left on the street, and (certainly in the UK) the back alleyway is usually filled with rubbish anyway so you can&#39;t &#39;wheel&#39; one round from your back yard. As such people keep it in bags still which end up piled up kerb side pending &#39;garbage day&#39;. This creates problems and often just leads people to be lazier and dumping their rubbish either in the street or the rear alleyway. This option would definately make more sense in those situations.

I&#39;d rather have the big bin within a few feet of my back door and then cart the big bin out to the curb once a week.  As far as racoons, mine were easily thwarted by sticking a nail through a tiny hole I made that runs through both the front of the lid and the lip of the trashcan.

And if you have to carry rubbish further, and carry all the different types of recycling separately, I can imagine a lot more people wouldn&#39;t bother to separate it out – especially if you have to feed the recycling in a bit at a time – and would just junk everything into general waste."

I actually hated the underground containers when we lived in the cities. You pay per time you use the underground container so you only trash completely full trashbags. In the summer in a south facing appartment it would get so gross with all food scraps and fruit flies. We&#39;d have to worry about maggots and everything in the house. Now, we take our food scraps outside every day and it&#39;s so much cleaner! Also, it&#39;s much cheaper because we only pay for 1 container. The compost bin and recycling bin are free to empty."

After you tell this story, you state that Toronto spent 31 Million $ on developing a safe trash can, which is a lot of money, sure, but I somewhat doubt that the development, installation, and maintainance of these underground trash collectors was cheaper than that.

We only see the trash bags a few hours before they collect it, and if they don&#39;t collect we put it back inside and try another day.<br>Also, if it is way too heavy (usually when you are building your house or modificating it), you need to call a special number to pick it up, or hire a business that specializes in this type of trash. <br><br>This way my city is one of the cleanest I&#39;ve ever been, and I love it!"
Robert Kribs,2020-11-21T04:28:14Z,2020-11-21T04:28:14Z,1,"I must say that there are huge differences in approach to garbage collection throughout NY state - even between communities only a few miles apart. The state is likely a microcosm of the world. My city (Syracuse NY) started an aggressive recycling program long before it was a household word but now with changes in the recycling market place (especially China no longer buying US recyclables) much more of our waste is going to local landfills. The local agency brags that 56% of our local waste is recycled so that gives me hope. In addition the non-recycled waste is burned in an emission controlled plant (heavily regulated) that produces enough electricity to power 30,000 homes. The burning reduces the amount of solid waste that goes to landfills by 90%. That&#39;s encouraging too but it&#39;s still not enough in my book. <br><br>Many of us are familiar with the garbage chutes in large apartment buildings with no responsibility for the tenant to do anything but throw a bag down a chute. In some cities in NY the landlords are responsible to get the trash to the curb for a weekly public pickup and in others a private contractor must be hired. In most of the cities in NY, residential neighborhoods the trash/recycling pick up is weekly but the degree of recycling varies quite a bit. There is no law requiring recycling. It&#39;s not a surprise that NYC recycles less than 20% of its waste.<br><br>In suburban areas outside of Syracuse there is very limited public trash pick up. A few villages provide the weekly service but most towns require you to hire a private contractor. Interestingly some municipalities in NY (including the city of Buffalo) require the use of residential garbage cans that can be picked up by a mechanical arm attached to the garbage truck. It is illegal for residents of NY to burn trash so even the rural towns have to figure it out and my guess is that the large portion of trash in NY outside of the cities is picked up by privately hired contractors."

simonriddick,2020-10-26T01:52:52Z,2020-10-26T02:00:37Z,0,Canada here. I have mostly recyclables but food scraps I put in a container and freeze in the freezer and then put in my compost when it gets full. I started doing that because the animals tear into any bag that smells like food. I even used heavy duty bags and doubled up and they still get in. If I do have a garbage bag that smells a bit I take it out in the morning before I leave for work so it&#39;s not outside all night for them to get to. The green bins are a joke no way i&#39;m leaving that rotten thing near the house. Also you have to buy bags extra for them screw that. Also here every week is recycling and you have to wait 2 weeks for garbage and green bin. Imagine 2 weeks in the summer with food rotting away in a green bin. Another problem with blue bins is when it gets windy garbage goes flying down the street. I see it all the time it makes one hell of a mess sometimes. The derelicts up the street don&#39;t follow any rules and have clear bags or put out car tires or whatever random shit they need out. I think too putting the food in the compost is much better anyways because it feeds the squirrels and trash pandas and skunks so they aren&#39;t so aggressive for the garbage bags. One time I went out there and I had 2 cats 2 trash pandas and a skunk all hanging out back there lol. I turned my flashlight on and said hey what&#39;s going on back here and they all looked at me lol. Meow!.

On any day you can just throw your stuff in your bins and you roll them out on garbage day to pick them up later when you have the time.<br><br>Being in control of your bins is just way better. These containers are overly full at times, causing piles to form around them. The lack of responsibility is just too detrimental. There are also cases of people throwing in burning material or a roaming cat in them requiring emergency services to be involved.<br><br>And perhaps the biggest long-term issue is that sorting waste for recycling becomes way to inconvenient. I live in a place that uses these and if I want to separate plastic I&#39;d need a separate bag to carry it 4 streets to a container. And paper isn&#39;t even in such a system, likely because of the fire hazard it would pose. And you can&#39;t really empty out into these containers either, so you basically have to make lots of little trips or use bags for every kind of trash."

And if the bin is full, you can always call the right city service and they will come and collect the trash. It all depends on the city tho.

If its card registered as stated somewhere above, I can see eventually the council charging by the pound of trash thats put in/ giving tax incentives for recycling and the lot to get people to go more zero waste. It wouldn&#39;t stop people from throwing their trash everywhere but if you had a &#39; litter picker&#39; registered card you could essentially work for the city in your spare time to earn side money by collecting recycling/ garbage and throwing it out. Pay like 50p per pound for recycling or something. It would give kids a good eco positive afterschool activity."

The problem is you still have to walk all the way out of your house and down the road to the public trash receptacle every time you want to empty your trash. What would really be better is for every house to have an indoor chute that leads to a massive underground trash collection system or incinerator.

Although there was none close to where I lived, and none of the places I found took all type of (common) recycling. For example I did not find a place that would take both glass and plastic.

We also dump it in Malaysia, we are suppose to be the good guys! The top 5 countries for recycling are Germany, Austria, S. Korea, Wales, Switzerland. The UK has set a target of recycling 50% and they are about 43% at the current time.

But what happens when it&#39;s full and who wants to put in bottles one at a time? What do you do with large styrofoam and large cardboard? Cutting/breaking it?<br><br>This system only looks like it works in some situations. Mainly this looks ok for newer cities. But what about rural areas and older cities? The smaller the country and the more densely packed the population makes this work better. Also, it&#39;s not always so easy to just dig a large hole anywhere you want in a city. Many things can already be underground there. Any city that has overhead power lines will also have a problem, it looks like the truck has to lift really high into the air.<br><br>Also, I would consider the days the bins get emptied as &quot;trash days&quot;. You still have a large truck, noise, smell, etc. Some places will have it picked up on a certain day of the week and others only when they get full, but those are the trash days."

This apartment area is like 2 blocks of 5-7 apartment building with 18 flats per building, and there are at the end of each block theese kinda domes with the same kinda round trap door as the old garbage chutes, and in there is a pit so deep, that a child that fell into 1 around here could not even be rescued by rope or anything, they had to wait for a wheelloader to come lift the whole thing up.

They just come to collect the garbage in the evenings and clean the apartment once every weekend. So the &quot;kapıcı&quot; collects the trash of the apartment right before the garbage truck arrives, and puts them in front of the apartment. Then the garbage trucks collect the whole city&#39;s garbage every evening. We just have to put the trash in a big black plastic bag and we are only allowed to put the garbage bags in front of apartments in certain timespans, otherwise we pay some fine.

No. Not on the watch of the town gossip. Everyone has to pay for every bin, so if it is half full you are encouraged to wait out to the next trash day, getting the waste steamy. They even have barcodes and RFID chips to resolve disputes about whose bin is standing in front of the house and the bins are rented from the trash collection company. <br>Imagine the comusism of just putting some bins along the road that are owned by the city.

Alex Chen,2020-10-09T03:44:55Z,2020-10-09T03:44:55Z,0,"I don’t think the Dutch underground solution would work well in a subtropical environment. The cockroaches will be having a feast. Also there would be a stench from rotting and spoiled food in the summer heat. It will be very difficult to make sure that the plastic bags used to contain food do not leak. That would also make a mess of the trash containers. So, the best solution was to have the trucks come just about every day. That way, you don’t need to keep any spoiling food around the apartment. You clean it out just about every day. You don’t need to walk far either because the trucks can easily make the necessary stops so that no one would need to walk more than half a block. The sanitation workers are there also to help sort out what are recyclables and food wastes. There used to be big huge metal bins where the trash was left for a week. Basically you ended up in a smelly neighborhood with an infestation of fearless cockroaches and giant well-fed rats. The cost increase in instituting the above approach is minimal but the returns transformed the neighborhood from a smelly one to one you can breathe freely."

I could, rather than waste plastic bags for my garbage, throw milk cartons and other bigger trash items right down the chute.<br>The only downside was some noise on Thursdays when they were emptied (day time of course) and occasionally when people threw heavy stuff down the chutes which ended with a big bang at the bottom floor.<br><br>One particular area even had a automated collection system in place, where each garbage bag thrown down the chute were conveyed via a screw underground to a central location where it was compacted into a container.<br>On &quot;garbage day&quot;, the &quot;garbage truck&quot; (container truck) only needed to hook the container and replace it with an empty one.<br>Of course, that system eventually broke down because people stupidly threw all kinds of junk down said chutes rather than just soft household garbage.<br>But the tunnels are still there, waiting to be repaired. It was a super efficient system.<br><br>They closed these down for some stupid reason, it was a near perfect system really.<br>Nowadays, you have to go down to the bottom floor, all the way out to a building located at the parking lot and throw your garbage in open bins.<br>That building smells of absolute ASS, it&#39;s locked with a keycard lock so you have to have that ready while also holding a bag of garbage.<br>People throw their garbage RIGHT ON THE FLOOR because they don&#39;t want to enter the building seeing as how filthy and smelly it is. Opening the door from the inside makes you wanna wash your hands with sulfuric acid right away.<br>Many times, people don&#39;t even open the door to the building but rather dump their garbage outside the door so seagulls and rats flock around said garbage until it&#39;s blown literally EVERYWHERE.<br>AND, many people put their garbage bags outside their apartment doors in wait for the next time they are going to go to the building... So the whole access stairwell smells of garbage and discarded diapers.<br>And of course it&#39;s a hazard.<br><br>I disagree with your notion that these are any good. What&#39;s good is some way of dumping your garbage down a chute conveniently and then having all that garbage end up in a central location to be picked up by a simple container truck.<br>Sure, it&#39;s more expensive that way but the convenience and efficiency is par none."

First I could just put the container in my front yard and roll it to the side of the street once a week, now when I have garbage I gotta take the garbage all the way to the end of the street where they have some of these containers, not very fun when it&#39;s heavy or when it&#39;s raining or when I just wanna put something in the garbage outside in my pjs without my neighbors seeing. And also, half the time these underground containers are stuck or full so they don&#39;t open. Which means people leave their garbage next to it, which smells for the people living around it but it&#39;s also just disgusting to look at and it gives us rats. But not to worry, the government knows how to deter criminals! They search through your garbage if you leave it next to the containers for anything with an address on it. Most people don&#39;t throw away anything with their address on it, but my dumbass walked passed the container (not knowing this) with a note that I no longer needed, with my address on it. So I decided to stuff that little piece of paper in one of the garbage bags that was already standing next to the underground container, and a week later I got a ticket for putting &quot;my garbage&quot; next to the container. If I had just thrown the piece of paper I wouldn&#39;t have got a ticket, but I know not to litter so I put it in a garbage bag and that&#39;s what happens. Well, that&#39;s my rant about underground containers. I didn&#39;t proofread this so I hope it makes sense lol"

SD,2020-10-08T00:52:52Z,2020-10-08T00:52:52Z,1,"Why not make sure that you are truly saved by Jesus Christ and practice this way. Remorsefully confess with your heart your sins to Jesus Christ who is God and tell Him that you right now are repenting of your sins and you want to be born again of the Spirit from above. Tell Jesus that you are remorsefully sorry for breaking His commandments and that you are begging for forgiveness from Him. Allow His blood from the cross to wash away your sins. After this is done with your heart successfully the Holy Spirit will come to live within you and He will rebuild you from the inside out. <br><br>Look for signs that you are saved. Things like spreading the good news from Jesus, getting other people saved, a craving for the word of God, reading the Bible, etc… These things are known as a calling and fruit bearing. If you&#39;re not bearing fruit then keep doing it. Sometimes it takes time to get saved. Read Matthew chapter 13 from the King James Bible. God bless!!!"

They are usually stored in front of houses and building or sometimes in the backyard. Nobody has to bring them out front on garbage day. The garbage men have keys to get the garbage bins. I do not know for sure when our garbage gets picked up because I do not have to. If you have a problem with rats, mice or maybe foxes in your trash (we have no trash pandas here) or others are using your bins you can get garbage bins with locks. The garbage men have master keys and can open them when needed. We have special containers for glass and paper that everyone can use. Paper gets full quite fast because only some people have paper bins themselves. If your bins are always full before the garbage is taken you can get a bigger one, but you will also have to pay more for the disposal."

Bill Hamilton,2020-10-07T14:13:08Z,2020-10-07T14:13:08Z,0,Well Toronto is run by a bunch of left wing Wienies. They will spend millions on computer systems that don&#39;t work for city hall employees but won&#39;t keep the streets clean or remove snow on narrow streets. In an effort to &quot;Control heavy traffic&quot; They took one lane on the main street and turned it into an island median thereby reducing the ability to drive even more. It&#39;s as though Toronto  politicians don&#39;t want cars and trucks in the city at all and they are doing everything they can to make that impossible. Meanwhile gun related crime is way out of control.
TheHim2,2020-10-07T13:51:36Z,2020-10-07T13:51:36Z,0,where i live the big green bins are stored in a dedicated gated slot outside the house in a way that you dont see it. you just take a bag out every so often and the truck comes at a time when most are at work and a guy pulls the bin out for the truck to handle it. in other places like cities with buildings there are just big steel containers outside in a parking lot or big plastic bins in a corner within the buildings area that is out of site. the most we have are cats the go through the junk though.

My taxes are already stupid high and I&#39;m thankful they&#39;re not going to pay two workers wages to be 3/4 less productive than one wage in a front load. Luckily garbage is private sector here and competitive in pricing, where government funded you play by their rules.

However looking from where I live, New York City, people barely use trash bins when they are next to them.  The thought that people would walk to these underground containers with their household garbage is unlikely."
Midan,2020-10-06T19:09:14Z,2020-10-06T19:09:14Z,0,"What trash system is used should be tailored to the density of the population. The Amsterdam trash system sounds like it makes great sense for dense urban areas, but as someone that has grown up and lived in the states in less dense neighborhoods it wouldn&#39;t make any sense. The cost of putting in underground bins wouldn&#39;t make any sense in a suburb with less dense population and when you have wheeled bins to wheel down your driveway. Bins are usually put at the curb or on a grassy median between the sidewalk and the street, and streets and sidewalks are generally wide so there is no real disruption. <br><br>I have also never really had a problem forgetting to put out the trash aside from when I first move in someplace and have to get into the routine. Nowadays it is even easier when you can just set a weekly reminder on your phone. I have never had to carry a bin once as I have always lived in places with a driveway. I know some people have issues with &quot;Trash Pandas&quot;, but never had issues with that personally. That is probably because we have generally kept our trash bins in the garage to both prevent critters getting into them and also making it very convenient to drop your trash or recyclables in without going far or dealing with weather.<br><br>So if you&#39;re in a suburban area, wheeled bins and trash days make a lot of sense. If you&#39;re in an Urban area, communal bins that get picked up regularly make a lot of sense. The problems come when the system doesn&#39;t match the environment."

Ever tried to shove your plastic recycling one by one down the tiny opening of these orange plastic bins? It&#39;s like they don&#39;t want you to recycle.

Your city pass has credits on it, and it gets debited depending on Weight*type of rubbish... eg paper is a lot cheaper than non-recyclables, glass is free. It&#39;s very handy as you don&#39;t need to stack up garbage all week.  Though, we can still ORDER a thrash-day; when we want to dispose of big items like televisions, matrasses, furniture, ...

This sucks because there municipalities that have good schedule pickup like mine that passes from Monday to Friday and pickups everything even oversized stuff. Or you could live in one that is broke and you have to be responsible for taking your trash to a dumbster far away. This has led to people actually hiring private companies for residential trash this is bad because they do not recycle and are expensive. The only good upside is that we do not have raccoons so trash can just be left outside in open drums wich make it easy for the trashmen.

I remember back in the days when I lived on the 8th floor in an apartment block outside Stockholm, right outside my door next to the stairs in the floor hall, there was this huge pipe that goes down to the waste container for the garbage trucks to carry. On each floor this pipe has circular shaped metal cabinet  like door which you can open and then you just throw in your trash bags and when done you close it. It was so time saving and relieving considering the fact that you didn&#39;t have to go out when it was freezing cold and up and down.

Dont think that more is better, it&#39;s not. Just a teaspoon to a full bottle is more than enough or a full dropper. Spray anywhere you don&#39;t want to see critters, reapply after rain, if spraying out side. Done. USE gloves. These oils are highly flammable. If you do nothing else, wash your hands several times after use. It&#39;s so strong I use goggles and a mask, you may not need them. For cats, use citrus, like orange peels. They hate it."
eris smith,2020-09-27T16:57:28Z,2020-09-27T16:57:28Z,3,I feel like those bins would definitely help minimize the rodent populations in some cities like NYC

Basically every day at night the garbage truck passes and picks up the trash from those designated containers. Some of ours are underground while others are above ground. Never the less you just take out the garbage from your home to this containers when you want and then its not your problem anymore 😅

I especially like it that the garbage bin in the street, when it notices its getting full, sends a message over the internet to the garbage collector company, and first thing at 8 in the morning, there is the garbage collector truck. Furthermore, it can only be opened by a card which accompanies your house. And it registers how much garbage you throw away, sends that data to the municipality, and they tax you for the weight of the garbage you threw away. It even shows you in detail how many kilograms of trash you throw away each year!"

When the garbage truck comes, they just get the bins from there and empty them. While maybe not as efficient time wise for the garbage services, it solves the problem without having any visible trash cans on the street and since we don’t have raccoons in Germany, worst case it smells a bit strange. I actually prefer that greatly to glass, which is handled by big containers, I never bother to walk to, thus always having a collection of glass unter my sink, I really don’t need that for paper, recycling, trash and bio waste aswell. Of course if the houses don’t have any courtyards, this could be a useful solution."

kaiser reinhard,2020-08-13T23:30:17Z,2020-08-13T23:30:17Z,2,"when i lived in the netherlands I lived right outside of Amsterdam in amstelveen, but over there there was garbage day, but only for paper, compost, and regular trash, glass was dealt with like in the video. Until about a year ago when they installed trash &quot;things&quot; like in the video, you could say ours were extra high tech as they told the city when to empty them, had a compactor, and even wasn&#39;t accessible unless you had a special card issued by the city (of course mine broke)."
enzyme F,2020-08-13T12:05:36Z,2020-08-13T12:05:36Z,0,"Most places in the Netherlands still have trash days. And pretty much every municipality handles it differently. In some cities apartment blocks will have underground trash bins which you&#39;ll have to open with a card to prove that you actually live there. Family houses will have a garbage truck coming by every week. There is usually a set price that everyone has to pay monthly or yearly through taxes in these places. <br><br>In my perticular town there are garbage days like normal. You can choose the size of your container depending on your household. There is one green container for garden waste and fruit/vegetable waste, and one grey container for rest waste (restafval). In my town you pay per load. Every time the container is picked up, it will be scanned. At the end of the year you&#39;ll receive the bill from emptying the containers together with other local taxes.<br><br>We do have underground containers as well. Though they are reserved for things that can be recycled. There is one for cans, one for milk cartons, one for glass bottles, one for plastic packing materials. There is even one for diapers. There ar put together at convenient places and are free to use for everyone. That&#39;s just the small municipality/town where I live though. As I said, everyone handles it differently, and my example would be much less convenient and efficient in cities."

California Liberation Movement,2020-08-11T06:59:12Z,2020-08-11T06:59:12Z,1,"Underground containers would make a lot of sense in much of Honolulu. The sidewalks are so narrow that they often have to go into the street. In Chinatown, the produce markets are infamous for harboring rats. In places like Waikiki, the sidewalk trash bins must be emptied almost daily, because of the constant foot traffic. Finally, if they were installed in residential areas -- not likely -- one would not have to worry about someone going through your garbage for aluminum cans. A human being can cause  as much of a mess as a raccoon, for sure.<br><br>Underground bins would be a costly investment, but it would solve many problems in that unique city."

And as there is many it s worth it financialy for the city. For the resident you don t have to go far. And if it s full there is another neer.<br><br>However in suburbs, for the same space you have 3-4 household. So you would have 1 underground garbage container per huge street if you want to fill it weekly. Meaning people would have to walk long way with trash. If it s full, good luck reaching the next one. And the truck would make a long tour.<br><br>Or worst like in my town. They indeed put underground container in suburb. Anyone but the one living near take their car to bring trash bag to those. The city wanted to reduce polution and noise from garbage truck an now there is always 1 or 2 car going up and down the street. Sure no garbage day is enjoyable.

Here a part of the inner city has garbage containers that &quot;suck&quot; the garbage to the process facility. No more garbage trucks to pick up trash! Unfortunately they made the system smaller because of regular malfunction in the system but it is still great to see. They even put some of the system behind glass to observe.

I take my can down the stairs empty and put bag or bags in afterward.  I try to not put any trash outside until trash day.  If i do i put in bin with lid and put heavy brick on top.  Too heavy for racoons or critters to get in.  Its never been a problem that way.

It’s a nice system until you lose the damn card 😅 then you got to order a new one, pay €10 for it and you have to come pick it up yourself. The containers we have report automatically when they’re full iirc but have ran into full one a few times or find that someone put something in that got stuck rendering the thing unusable until cleared. I’m lucky to have two in my street, so I can usually go to the other one, but I’ve heard there are a few neighborhoods that only have one to serve quite a lot of houses and it’s a couple minute round trip for the people living furthest away... Probably still better than having your own personal bin that you have to remember to put out on the street and being stuck with the trash for another week at least if you forget...."
Ralph Verwegen,2020-06-24T12:36:22Z,2020-06-24T12:36:22Z,0,"It&#39;s very nice that you introduce this concept to countries other than the Netherlands, but there are some very major drawbacks you fail to mention. <br>1. Kids have been known to mess about and get trapped in these. <br>2. There is such a thing as garbage day (when they come to empty them), and in some places you do end up worrying about them, because the containers fill up FAST. In my experience, they often fill up leading up to trash day and subsequently trash accumulates outside of the containers. So there is still garbage on the streets. In the Hague, they don&#39;t get emptied often enough, so we deal with flocks of seagulls ripping trash bags apart. <br>3. The containers system doesn&#39;t allow for the disposal of any oddly shaped garbage. If it doesn&#39;t fit in the little mouth section, you end up having to cut/break your trash apart. Any oddly shaped stuff usually ends up being stacked against the disposal unit. Again, trash accumulates on the streets. <br>4. The Netherlands doesn&#39;t have raccoons. It solves an issue we don&#39;t deal with. The containers do keep the sidewalks clear of big bins. That&#39;s a big plus. However, when it fails, the trash bags accumulating on the street are easy pickings for the pests that we DO have (Birds and rats)<br>5. The rotating mechanism has a tendency to fail. If gunk gets into the system (which it will, because its a trash disposal unit) or if enough people try to stuff their oddly shaped trash into the unit, it can get stuck. This means the lid no longer opens or closes. If that happens, NOBODY can use the unit anymore, and trash simply accumulates again. <br><br>I&#39;m not saying that the alternatives for densely populated cities are much better, but there is a good reason why the majority of the Netherlands outside of densely populated areas uses bins. The containers are good because they trap the smell of waste and make it so there aren&#39;t large stacks of bags or rows of bins out on the small city streets. They also encourage the recycling. But they are not aimed controlling pests. If anything, they allow for pests to thrive."

We have cats get into them, but usually they don&#39;t make much mess....homeless and  mentally ill people are the only ones that ever cause any serious mess, and fortunately they are rare. Dumpster divers generally keep it clean so they don&#39;t get banned from picking in them. We often leave clothing or other recyclable materials near it for dumpster divers or other neighbors.

Where I live the underground containers are sometimes incredibly deep and when the crane lifts one up, a spring loaded barrier comes up to prevent any one or pets falling in.<br><br><br>Now so many people dump garbage, for example when their chipcard or the system did not function or they had greater garbage, some containers are surrounded by a little garden. The square pot with all the nice plants is lifted high up in the air.<br><br><br>Towns have also connected deep bins to the containers, where for example broom sticks can be thrown in and that can be used by pedestrians that produce any waste.

My little brother still lives with them and one of his chores is putting it out the night before because they always come early in the morning. You don&#39;t use bins, you literally just put the binbags on the curb. When I grew up there were painted on blocks on the pavement that made them dedicated for garbage. So you couldn&#39;t just throw it out your front door, you had to bring it to the pick up point. It was never far though, usually just the corner of the street so the garbage truck only had to go down the length of a street and didn&#39;t have to worry about individual side streets."

What I&#39;ve seen so far is that containers are more effective in dense neighborhoods (e.g. where flats or shared buildings - &quot;boven/ onderwoningen&quot; - are ) Houses that stand free usually still have garbage day, but since Vlaardingen (and mostly many other cities in the Netherlands) has a diverse mix of types of buildings in the same neighborhoods, its very common to see both (garbage day aswell as the containers). It is true, there are many containers in which you can throw your garbage away (that are maybe ~125meters (distance is mostly depended on the density and mix of the buildings of the neighborhood) away from your front door) before garbage day, if you dont have the garbage bin option (mostly common in the shared buildings &amp; flats). I highly would recommend you to expand your view of the Netherlands and to just not only limit it to Amsterdam. Amsterdam is a city on itself. And most likely not comparable to the rest of the Netherlands in many facets of the life of a Dutchman"

There are two problems with underground bins I have seen.<br><br>Firstly. The emptying of the bins is pretty loud, especially in a city landscape where the metal clanging echoes off of the buildings. I&#39;ve been woken up quite often by the emptying of the bins. And because the time slots aren&#39;t communicated to nearby residents, it&#39;s extra disruptive. A garbage truck picking up &#39;trash-panda bins&#39; is a lot less noisy in my experience. (And we don&#39;t have raccoons in the NL, so that&#39;s not something we have to worry about a lot)<br><br>Secondly, the underground bins at hotspots generate a lot of stray trash (&#39;zwerfafval&#39;). Little bits of plastic or paper which blow away in the wind during depositing of trash. Or even worse, whenever a bin is full, people place their trash next to the bin. The trash next to it will eventually be picked up, but mostly the elements have several days to wreak havoc in it and spread bits and pieces all over the surrounding area.<br><br>Compared to other systems I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s a good system, but there ís room for improvement and I&#39;ve heard of enough people protesting the placement of bins near their houses for the above reasons."

The government eventually wants to charge every household according to the weight of their garbage which can be measured with the passes that provide access to these underground containers. They&#39;ve been running pilots in smaller municipalities for years. The problem is that applying a cost to disposing garbage <i>in</i> the container will lead to people simply disposing the garbage <i>outside</i> the container or start all kinds of cute fraudulent tricks, like disposing garbage in recycle containers or dumping it in nature. So the government hasn&#39;t figured this out quite yet and meanwhile the increased costs are felt in the increased municipal tax."

Jeroen,2020-01-21T17:56:52Z,2020-01-21T17:56:52Z,514,It still exist in the outskirts of Amsterdam. It is simple: if you have a garden in Amsterdam you have a big bin and a garbage day(there are exceptions). If you live in appartments you have the underground garbage and thus no garbage day.

Additionally, since this year the foodwaste bins have chips in them to track the amount of trash per household, to better allocate resources."
Zyonin Kiro,2020-01-20T11:35:00Z,2020-01-20T11:35:00Z,6,"I remember seeing those underground bins in Amsterdam when I was vacationing there about 14 years ago.   We rented an apartment (a &quot;proto AirBnB&quot; aka before AirBnB) and we would drop our trash and recyclables in them when we left for the day.   They got me wishing that we had those bins in Athens, Greece where I was living at the time.   <br>Regarding the &quot;trash pandas&quot;, we had them where I grew up in Montana, however the trash pandas were not the biggest garbage diners, that honor fell to the local black bear population."

Jeroen Geurtsen,2020-01-20T06:54:14Z,2020-01-20T06:54:14Z,0,I think maybe 5% of Dutch households have such a system. So we have a long way to go with this.

Metal Videos,2020-01-18T12:05:24Z,2020-01-18T12:08:13Z,3,there is a garbage day in the netherlands. maybe not in big cities. but residential do have normal garbage bins that get picked up by a garbage truck. believe the green bin every 2 weeks and the grey bin every week. so yeah big cities does it with underground bins. but not in small residentials. but where i live in a small village in the netherlands we do have a underground bin as well. but thats because i live in an apartment. normal houses all have standard containers. its simply not pracitcal in big cities. so they find a solution for it. we used to have big metal containers as wel for everybody to dumb their stuff in. but they get so cluttered with other people garbage that didnt live in the  buildings. so they decided to put in underground bins as well. we need a special card provided by the municipality to open the bin. so nobody else can put their stuff in. only the people that live in the building where the garbage bin is provided for. which i find a good solution.
P Constructor,2020-01-18T11:22:21Z,2020-01-18T11:22:21Z,1,"I live in an appartement building in a small town. For the residual waste (grey waste) I got a card from the municipality for the card locked underground waste container near the entrance of the building. There is a weighing system inside that adds up your kilos residual waste and that you have to pay for. For all other waste you don’t have to pay. So it’s an incentive to recycle and have as little residual waste as possible. My empty glass bottles I have to deliver to another underground container for the whole neighborhood, you separate the glass in green, brown and colorless. The PMD waste (plastic, metal cans, drink cartons) is collected every fortnight in special plastic bags, you hang those bags off the ground on the posts of the streetlights, on special hooks so rodents and cats can’t reach them. The bags you can get free at your supermarket or at the municipality. And paper and carton is collected monthly, you can put it along the road in a plastic crate, a cardboard box or the blue kliko (roll container). I downloaded an app from the municipality that can be set up with a warning signal or message the night before or on collection day, so I won’t forget which waste is collected the next day."
J Groenveld,2020-01-18T04:23:46Z,2020-01-18T04:23:46Z,1,Well the concept isn&#39;t foreign to Canadians. A lot of areas have now removed individual mail boxes and now have them in a multiple box unit normally located in the middle of an area. Why don&#39;t we do this with trash too?

rolandcombes,2020-01-16T16:44:17Z,2020-01-16T16:44:17Z,103,"Here in Leiden (Netherlands), we used to have a similar problem a few years ago but with trash birds (seagulls). On trash day, they would descend on the bags and rip them to shreds, strewing garbage across the streets, while noisily quarreling amongst themselves. The gemeente (local government) of Leiden undertook a campaign to get people to start using seagull-proof yellow trash bags, which proved quite unsuccessful, going as far as launching an ad campaign depicting the seagulls as gangsters. In the end, the gemeente gave up and installed these underground trash collection points (one right outside the house we had just bought). Although the noise of the trash truck can be excessive, and we&#39;ve pressured the gemeente to adjust the collection hours to later on in the day, it&#39;s such a relief not having to deal with the mess and noise of the seagulls."

Hanneke N,2019-12-30T09:41:45Z,2019-12-30T09:41:45Z,509,"This is not quite as universal as you make it sound 🙂. These underground trash bins are used in denser neighborhoods, inner cities and for midrise appartment blocks and highrise flats. They can often be card-locked for use by the residents only.<br>The underground recycling bins for glass, paper and plastic (and sometimes for other things like metals or old clothes and shoes) are universal; they are placed in every neighborhood and near neighborhood stores and around shopping centers, for use by everyone.<br><br>The lower-density neighborhoods (as in suburbs and smaller towns) do tend to have the large plastic rolling bins of different colours for trash and recycling, that are picked up on an elaborate schedule in alternating weeks - everyone has a gray one for trash and a green or brown one for composting waste, then most municipalities have a third colour (blue, or gray with orange lids, or whatever)  for a third type that differs by municipality: I have an orange-lid one for plastics, my father in a different town has a blue one for paper. His plastics get collected in plastic bags once every fortnight, our more windy town stopped doing that as the wind made a mess of those bags, so they switched to the third container. Our paper still gets picked up by volunteers for the sports clubs and churches, who get paid for the volume they collect. In dad&#39;s town they didn&#39;t consider that economically sensible, and the municipality collects the paper trash in the blue household bins.<br><br>But even in areas with separate household recycling bins you&#39;ll find the underground recycling bins, at the least near the neighborhood store (but often in more locations), for people who don&#39;t want to collect all these separate fractions at home for two weeks, and don&#39;t mind walking 50 meters to dispose of it, or taking the empties back when they go to the shop."
