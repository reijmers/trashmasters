Lithuania ABSTRACT  
With half of the global population living in urban areas, prevailing unsustainable production and consumption 
patterns, and ecological crises, the circular economy topic gains momentum. However, the implementation of the 
circular economy from a local governance point of view has been explored in a rather fragmented manner, 
although public policies remain crucial in driving countries towards more circular systems. This paper aims to 
explore whether and how local governments contribute to circular economy implementation by applying Voβ 
et al.‘s (2007) steering framework for sustainable development. By using desk research analysis and focus group 
and individual interview discussions with representatives of municipalities and regional waste management 
centres, we identified challenges for implementing the circular economy with a lack of local governments ’ 
contribution, namely municipal waste management, textile waste, distribution of human resources, networking, 
and local business. Finally, we created a framework for circular solutions by mapping national and foreign 
practices through five perspectives, namely learning, sharing vision, reflexive governance, regulation, and 
negotiation in networks.   
1.Introduction 
In the context of prevailing unsustainable production and con-
sumption models and ecological crises, the circular economy topic gains 
momentum. A circular economy is often presented as a practical strategy 
for implementing sustainable development (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ; 
Van den Bergh, 2020 ). The circular economy puts environmental sus-
tainability forward and acknowledges the need for favourable economic 
settings (Homrich et al., 2018 ), but social sustainability is usually absent 
and may even reinforce social inequality (Johansson and Henriksson, 
2020 ). The circular economy may be the expression towards weak sus-
tainability (Kirchherr et al., 2017 ; Johansson and Henriksson, 2020 ) as it 
suggests a system where recycling and reuse are assumed as substitutes 
for raw materials. The urgency behind a circular transformation is based 
on a looming resource and ecological crisis (Hobson and Lynch, 2016 ) as 
well as globalisation and increase of resources consumption (Bonciu, 
2014 ). 
In practice, the circular economy is implemented in diverse contexts, 
from resource efficiency (Blomsa and Brennan, 2017 ), product design (Lacy et al., 2020 ; Van den Bergh, 2020 ) and product integrity (Stahel, 
2010 ), appropriate waste management and recycling (Ghisellini et al., 
2016 ; Murray et al., 2017 ; Knickmeyer, 2020 ), companies ’ practices of 
reuse and repair caf˘es (Ghisellini and Ulgiati, 2020 ), post-consumption 
waste transformation into valuable materials (Braungart and McDo -
nough, 2002 ), and urban circular initiatives (Russell et al., 2020 ). 
Interestingly, the implementation of the circular economy from a 
local governance point of view has been explored in a rather fragmented 
manner, although public policies remain crucial in driving the EU to-
wards a full circular implementation (Cainelli et al., 2020 ). Historically, 
the EU waste legislation is very detailed and mature, since launching the 
first EU Packaging Directive in 1994, the End of Life Vehicles Directive 
in the late 1990s, and the 2008 Waste Framework Directive. Govern -
ments and policy makers mainly of developed countries have attempted 
to direct the growing material waste streams back into industry through 
recycling programs in order to close the material loop (Lieder and 
Rashid, 2016 ). Obviously, it has a direct impact on towns and cities by 
laying down waste management priorities and specific targets (e.g. 
management of municipal waste, e-waste). More recently, the circular
