4.1. Perception, Knowledge, and Attitudes of Students Regarding Solid Waste Management
A very important aspect of environmental education is the dissemination of informa-
tion on matters of environmental concern to the academic community as an entity, which
includes students, staff, and other workers. The results from the questionnaires indicate
that 88% of the students did not know those responsible for solid waste management in the
institution. This high percentage of respondents not knowing the responsible personnel is
an indication of the need for awareness. Students must have adequate knowledge of the
personnel responsible for solid waste management in the institution. This could encourage
effective communications of feedback and suggestion.
Keles [ 65] opined that higher institutions of learning have the responsibility to pio-
neer the process of building knowledge, and inculcating skills, awareness, values, and
sustainable attitudes, in order to enable a sustainable environment. This makes the lead-
ers of future generations innovative and critical reasoners, helping towards a sustainable
environment. To assess the performance of the current waste management system in the
institution, the students were asked to rate it from the range of excellent to bad (Table 1).
