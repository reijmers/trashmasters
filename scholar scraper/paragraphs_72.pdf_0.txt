eproducts have been central to the discussion of resource sustainability due to their growing demand use of critical resources and challenges in managing the resultingwaste stream ewaste as such the concept of circular economy which seeks to design out waste by better products practices and business models is deemed to be very relevant for eproducts the nature of circularsystems mandates a collective e ort of businesses consumers and governments while the technoeconomic sides of the circular economy have attracted large attention in recent years the role of consumer behavior a critical factor in de ning the longterm success of sustainable production and consumption initiatives remains less explored in this context this paper explores the potential of integrating lessons from behavioral sciences tofacilitate circular economy in ewaste management it o ers a review of prominent behavioral theories and their application in the context of sustainable consumption and proenvironmental behaviors finally the paper identies opportunities for behavioral interventions in improving ewaste management and in achieving a more circular economy introduction background electrical and electronic products eproducts have been one of the focus areas in the discussion of resource sustainability mainly due to a their growing demand b the use of critical resources and c challenges in properly managing the endoflife eol for eproducts known as e waste breivik et al habib et al ewaste is a fast growing waste stream globally which with the current trend is expected to double by parajuly et al ewaste is also a mixture of valuable resources and toxic substances that demandscareful handling eproducts have evolved to become complex and ubiquitous in everyday lives but ewaste collection and management systems have not caught up largely failing to ensure proper handling of ewaste this entails potential risks of resource losses and negativeimpacts on environment as well as human health wang et al b governments and other actors have taken actions to tackle the growing ewaste problem in europe for example the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive sets targets for collectionand subsequent processing of ewaste for material recovery european parliament the directive mandates all member states of the european union to facilitate separate collection of and resource recovery from ewaste more importantly the system based on extended producer responsibility epr principle has made producers re sponsible for their eproducts with the aim of improving recyclability and encouraging the integration of eol aspects during product design atasu for more than two decades concepts such as designfor recycling have also been in circulation kriwet et al and more recently the european ecodesign directive has begun to set design requirements for energyrelated products to include all stages of pro duct lifecycle including product eol european parliament the results of these collective e orts however have not been sa tisfactory despite relatively wellestablished waste management in frastructure in place european countries only collect about one third of the generated ewaste under the o cial collection systems with sig nicant quantities going to noncompliant waste management channels balde et al as for products themselves little evidence of design supporting eol resource recovery exists classic design aws are still found even in modern eproducts parajuly et al due to their  received august received in revised form november accepted

and design many eproducts are not compatible with material recycling processes which results in resource losses as the recycling techniques try to catch up with the everad vancing product design designforeol has not been the priority overall the lack of progress is disappointing considering how much policy development and technological research has taken place in recent years the concept of circular economy is deemed in creasingly relevant in addressing the ewaste problem circular economy aims to design out waste through optimization of products and materials cycles by keeping them at their highest utility and valueellen macarthur foundation with the help of cleaner and re newable technologies innovative business models and policies supporting them ghisellini et al such an optimization can be realized through betterdesigned products and business models thatallow a product lifetime extension b reuse of products and compo nents and c e cient material recovery from the eol products to begin with the vision of eprbased ewaste management system was inline with that of a circular economy as it was believed that by making producers responsible for eol collection and treatment they would be incentivized to reorganize business models and product designs to re duce their eol costs the implementation however has been limited to simply collection and subsequent material recycling processes with collective schemes o ering no incentive for individual actors to im prove resource recovery preparation for reuse of eol products whichwould conserve the embodied energy and many critical raw materials that are lost during recycling is almost nonexistent coughlan et al parajuly and wenzel in the academic discourse on environmental sustainability the consumption side of the product lifecycle has not always received equalattention as the production side most common carbon management frameworks use productionbased rather than consumptionbased ac counting sudmant et al the latter approach assigns emissions to the consumption point of goods and services which may provide abetter guide for climate policies steininger et al this practice however is not surprising given the linear nature of current economic systems in which production consumption and eol management ofconsumer goods are isolated in many regards in a circular economymore focus is on the consumption or use of artifact as the goal is tomaximize the usefulness and hence the utility of resources ellen macarthur foundation in this regard the technoeconomic aspects of the circular economy concept has been extensively studied in recent years however like in the sustainability debate the role mo tivations and drivers of end users behavior in a circular system has not been equally examined the social and behavioral elements linked toconsumption of everyday goods and how they need to be adapted to enable regular people to facilitate the success of a circular system re main largely unexplored camachootero et al in the midst of discussions on technicalities of improved ewaste collection and recycling rates users important role in sustainable production and con sumption of eproducts seems to have been neglected otto et al consumer behavior in a circular economy endusers of eproducts consumers are directly involved in the three key stages of a product lifecycle purchase use and eol man agement users behavior and decision making during these stages have direct implications to the success of not only the most preferred optionsin a circular economy reuse and repair but also subsequent resource recovery recycling at the product eol investing in more durable products andor engaging with circular business models purchase opting for repair and reuse of functional broken products use andtimely and proper disposal of products with no reuse potential eol management are examples of such consumer behaviors because of their interactions to everyday lives circular strategies seeking to boost resource e ciency including infrastructure products business models and policies will not succeed without the considera tion of public acceptance and adaptation cherry et al van weelden et al v there are technological as well as economic challenges in terms of infrastructure and incentives to implement aperfect system allowing all users and businesses to engage in the cir cular economy while many stakeholders are driven by monetary re wards and legislative requirements certain transactions rely on users behaviors eg exploring reuse options selling second hand

recycling x instead of stockpiling and recycling instead of wrongly discarding such behaviors have considerable impact on eol collection and re source recovery and on the success of a circular system for eproducts the majority of europeans are aware of the environmental issues linked to our consumption model and the importance of e ective use of resources european union many of them also claim to parti cipate in waste sorting and to be willing to try reused items or alter native business models such as leasing cerulliharms et al the practices however do not re ect the claims made by the people some examples of the gap between people s claims and their actions during purchase use and eol of eproducts are o ered in fig these ex amples are based on limited available data on consumer behavior and not all of them may be directly comparable to re ect the gaps never theless they o er a useful insight for example at the product eol of europeans claim that they sort their ewaste but only of the generated ewaste is collected under o cial collection systems in the eu it implies that part of the sorted ewaste is either stockpiled athomes or collected through uno cial channels moreover these gaps are the outcome not only of consumer choices but also of available ewaste disposal options and collection systems that are often beyond consumers control many environmental problems are rooted in human behavior and behavioral changes are therefore needed to utilize the potential of technological innovations helping environmental sustainability steg and vlek the e cacy of intervention strategies to promote pro environmental behavior relying on information campaigns is limited mainly because of the fact that environmental literacy do not ne cessarily translate into sustainable actions frisk and larson human behavior is understood to be linked to both intrinsic as well asextrinsic attributes martin et al in the context of sustainable consumption behavior intrinsic attributes include knowledge motivation beliefs habits values attitudes intentions and other psycholo gical variables whereas extrinsic attributes include social and culturalnorms monetary implications and contextual variables such as infra structure and institutional constraints jackson knussen and yule young et al this paper explores the possibilities and barriers in integrating behavioral insights in sustainable production and consumption initiatives method scope we study the potential for utilizing behavioral insights in the con text of circular economy and ewaste for this we review prominent behavioral theories models and intervention tools that are linked to sustainable consumption and proenvironmental behaviors the goal is to identify opportunities for implementing behavioral interventions in properly managing ewaste and in a larger context in achieving a more circular economy by promoting circular business models product life time extension and material recycling literature review we begin with an attempt to understand existing theories on human behavior and behavioral change from di erentelds of study including social and behavioral sciences economics and psychology we then closely analyze the literature where these theories are applied in the context of environmental and resource sustainability in order to a create an overview of behavioral theories linked to sustainable production and consumption and b collect examples of behavioral inter ventions in the context of eproducts and circular economy google scholar was used as the primary search tool for the publications using dierent combinations of keywords including behavior circular economy consumer consumption ewaste proenvironmental sustainable and theory however the search was not limited to theseterms and a snowball technique was used to identify all relevant literature within the scope of this paper since the literature in the eld of behavioral change for circular economy is limited we expand our scopebeyond the academic publications we include academic literature eg peer reviewed articles conference proceedings books chapters etc as well as other publications eg reports popular science books casestudies etc in our review in total publications were reviewed a list of reviewed publications on proenvironmental behaviors linked to waste management in general and speci cally on ewaste and circular economy along with their scope is provided as supplementarymaterial behavioral change the complex nature of human behavior is explained by several theoretical frameworks from varying elds of study more than dierent theories of behavior and behavioral change exist across the eld of psychology sociology anthropology and economics darnton davis et al widely used in the sector of public health the use of theorybased behavioral intervention is limited when it comes to promoting proenvironmental behaviors most common theories and models of proenvironmental behaviors can be grouped as moral rational choice and economic models turaga et al in addition nudging and communitybased social marketing are two popular intervention strategies that make the use of cognitive biases and social inuences respectively mckenziemohr thaler and sunstein the following sections brie y unpack these theories and inter vention tools an overview of which is illustrated in fig below rational choice theories attitude and subjective norms are the main constructs of rational choice theories kaiser et al the theory of planned behavior tpb is one of the most popular psychological theories used in theresearch of proenvironmental behavior botetzagias et al it suggests that proenvironmental behaviors are the result of rational choices made with the goal of maximizing personal bene tbamberg centered on an individual sintention to perform a certain be havior the tpb suggests that such intentions can be predicted from attitudes toward the behavior as well as subjective social norms and perceived behavioral control and the actual behavior is the result of these intentions combined with individual s perception of behavioral control ajzen assuming intention to be the most important factor in behavioral change the framework of tpb advocates for goal directed behavioral interventions for promoting proenvironmental fig elements of proenvironmental consumer behavior and their connection to the main theories and intervention strategies for behavioral changek parajuly et al resources conservation recycling x intention and thus behavior botetzagias et al past research have tested the e ectiveness of this theory in the domains of circular economy and ewaste management the tpb has been used as a framework to study for example determinants of con sumers ewaste disposal behavior intentions in china wang et al a and vietnam le et al willingness to participate in formal ewaste recycling in nigeria nduneseokwu et al in tentionbehavior gap in ewaste recycling in brazil echegaray and hansstein and young adults ewaste recycling behavior cross culturally in china and india kumar in addition the will ingness to participate in ewaste recycling with a points reward system zhong and huang and through online ewaste recycling plat forms wang et al were also investigated in china the tpb has also been used to analyze the key variables underlying the consumers purchase intentions of remanufactured eproducts jimnezparra et al the outcome of these studies which rely mostly on questionnaire surveys for data collection are mixed while some suggest that en vironmental awareness is the most important predictor of ewaste re cycling behavioral intention wang et al a others point to per ceived behavior control le et al attitude kumar and social norms echegaray and hansstein this suggests a potential indirect in uence of external factors possibly demographic and socio economic factors in determining ewaste recycling behavior which may challenge the generalized applicability of the tbp the famous intentionbehavior gap the fact that only few intentions translate into behaviors is another source of skepticism against founding be havioral change interventions on the tpb bamberg moral theories moral norms descriptive and prescriptive are a strong driver of proenvironmental practices as well as policies davis et al people in general value environmental quality and accept the responsibility to care for it and environmental campaigns can bene t more from appealing to people spositive selfconcept than their economic selfinterest bolderdijk et al behavioral change driven by in trinsic motivators may also be longer lasting than external eg nancial rewards that seem to dilute the purity of an altruistic act van der linden v altruistic values are positively linked to proen vironmental norms beliefs about environmental impacts and the ef fectiveness of one s action come into play between values and norms these beliefs and norms and thus the readiness to perform certainaction can be shaped by information stern the valuebeliefnorms vbn theory is arguably the most popular of moral theories in investigating proenvironmental behavior bronfman et al janmaimool and denpaiboon lopez mosquera and sanchez it provides a socialpsychological framework for examining normative factors promoting sustainable atti tude and behaviors which links personality elements beliefs about humanenvironment relations and the sense of moral obligation to pro environmental behaviors stern et al the theory suggests that proenvironmental behaviors are more likely to appear when peoplevalue the collective wellbeing over personal interest the relationship among variables of the vbn theory has been em pirically studied and veri ed in di erent settings for addressing varying environmental behaviors turaga et al but examples from the e waste and circular economy domains are limited in both number and scope the vbn theory was used in combination with other theories to evaluate residents willingness to participate in ewaste in usa saphores et al and to examine consumers perceptions towards reuse and recycling of eproducts in finland ylamella et al however the available studies do not evaluate the constructs of vbntheory using statistical analysis and are inconclusive regarding the signicance of moral constructs in de ning ewaste and circular economy related behaviors economic models in economics proenvironmental behaviors are modeled as the private provision of public goods saphores et al unlike psy chological theories the approach of economic models assumes in dividuals to be utilitymaximizers whose behavior can be in uenced through incentives nnorom et al individuals stated will ingness to pay wtp for environmental improvements has been widely used as a metric for proenvironmental behavior willingness to pay for better management of ewaste and waste in general has been studied in asian african and south american countries where proper infra structure as well as the polluterspay philosophy are yet to fully de velop dwivedy and mittal nnorom et al wang et al there are also examples though comparatively fewer from other regions including northern america and europe nixon et al saphores et al willingness to pay a premium for greener and remanufactured products have also been studied for di erent ca tegories of eproducts atlason et al michaud and llerena saphores et al wtp may vary with socioeconomic factors demography education level income etc turaga et al yin et al although axed to the economic value of outcome of the investment wtp also reects some degree of altruistic motives and moral values guagnano nunes and schokkaert some have even suggested that environmental attitude and values are stronger predictors of wtp thansocioeconomic characteristics nixon et al however the mar ketplace behavior of consumers are not always consistent with theirattitude or ethics de pelsmacker et al hypothetical bias is also a pronounced issue which suggest that the wtp preference may varybetween hypothetical and real settings but ndings are not conclusive aadland and caplan carlsson and martinsson communitybased social marketing social marketing exploits the evidence that people are more likely to follow what others do liebig and rommel it is a strategic planning process that uses marketing principles and techniques to in uence behavioral changes that bene t society and the individual salazar et al social marketing is compared with education and law as one of the three major tools for behavioral change with the claim that the toolbox of social marketing has more options than other the ories and frameworks for behavioral change a merger of knowledge from psychology and social marketing communitybased social mar keting cbsm is proposed as a pragmatic alternative to traditional informationintensive campaigns for behavioral change mckenzie mohr the tools used by cbsm include communication incentives norming and social di usion the cbsm has been studied in the context of for example fostering sustainable behavior paper reduction com mingled recycling purchasing environmentally preferred products at a university cole and fieselman and promoting waste recycling behavior of households haldeman and turner linder et al and of tailgaters in a sporting event martin et al we did notnd any examples of cbsm used in the context of ewaste and circular economy the cbsm approach is based on social psychology and the idea that behavioral changes are e ective when pushed by real people and at community levels mckenziemohr it provides a vestep guideline for behavioral change interventions selecting behaviors identifying barriers and bene ts developing strategies piloting and implementation and evaluation social concern for status is a keytrigger for consumption and therefore interventions based on social inuence may be e ective in changing consumer behavior orourke and lollo the resources in terms of time and money requiredfor the interpersonal communication in the cbsm programs has been highlighted as the major issue in implementing this behavioral changek parajuly et al resources conservation recycling x strategy haldeman and turner nudging nudging is based on the assumption that humans are not exclusively rational beings and do not always act based on their knowledge and intentions because their decision making is often not mindful and can be inuenced by heuristics and biases thaler and sunstein people s failure to always make rational choices works against the goal of behavioral change frameworks based on the utilitymaximization assumption eg economic incentives to address this two concepts choice architecture and libertarian paternalism have been proposed by behavioral economists sunstein based on these two con cepts a nudge helps people without compulsion but paternalizes them with a gentle push towards the right choice leonard in recent years nudging has been increasingly used as an umbrella term and is known as a lowcost solution for promoting proenvironmental behavior lander and thgersen contrary to other approaches that seek to completely change a be havior nudges rely on subtle ques to in uence on how people act without them even noticing it nudging evolved from the eld of be havioral economics which unlike conventional economic theories suggests that a material payo s are not the sole driver of human be haviors b social norms and context are important motivators and ccognitive limitations lead to irrational decisions carlsson and johanssonstenman an example of these elements coming into play is the signi cant di erence between willingness to pay and willingness to accept reported by empirical studies horowitz and mcconnell nudges have been tested and reported to be e ective in reducing food waste kallbekken and slen and plastic waste rivers et al and promoting more expensive green energy ebeling and lotz in the context of eproducts research examples include useof nudge to promote more durable products cerulliharms et al and to encourage repair leasing and purchase of greener mobile phones stefansdotter et al in both cases the experimental trials based on simulated situation produced promising results fornudges but their implementation in realworld setting is not known nudging is seen as a more rational approach to e ciently address individual behavior in environmental policies gsottbauer and van den bergh there are examples of investigations commissioned bygovernments as well as nongovernmental bodies mainly focusing on the policy aspects of user behavior however the initiative of im plementing evidencebased intervention is still in its infancy nudges can be an attractive policy tool because of their low implementation cost momsen and stoerk but there is not enough evidence to claim that the process of designing e ective nudges is inexpensive nudges are contextspeci c and not all nudging strategies are equally eective to tackle a particular behavior for example defaults are proven to be an e ective nudge strategy for promoting green energy while priming another nudge strategy is found to have no or even negative e ect momsen and stoerk a thorough methodological approach is therefore required to come up with the right nudgingstrategy there are also controversies and critics of behavioral inter ventions based on nudging which is accused of being manipulative and unethical and nudges are even argued to be un t for tackling society s major ills such as climate change goodwin relevance to the circular economy transition towards a circular economy is not possible without a fundamental change in consumer behaviors regarding green purchaseadaptation to new business models and acceptance of product up grading that involves repair and remanufacturing planing this will require addressing not only the extrinsic attributes eg infrastructure and incentives but also intrinsic attributes eg values andpersonal norms of human behavior fig conventional approaches to addressing this issue include initiatives such as information campaigns economic incentives and stricter regulations whereas the use of behavioral insight in such initiatives are still rare we can draw from literature that despite imperfections behavioral theories and inter vention tools are useful in addressing these social and psychological factors in order to drive proenvironmental practices this conveys an optimistic message on the potential for integrating behavioral strategies along the di erent lifecycle stages of eproducts to achieve a more circular economy challenges and opportunities the gap between circular economy principles and consumer prac tices may be bridged with the help of behavioral insights without sig nicantly altering the product lifecycle systems behavioral strategies may be used to promote for example purchase of green products or alternative business models such as leasing similarly strategies may seek to encourage product reuse and repair for product lifetime ex tension during the use stage finally at the end of a product s life behavioral interventions can be designed to motivate users and to fa cilitate timely and proper disposal for better management of ewastethe understanding of the socioeconomic and psychological factors inuencing human behaviors can help designing e ective strategies to engage individuals and businesses in a more circular economy the opportunities and challenges in implementing behavioral insights during purchase use and eol management are summarized below promoting green products displaying expected product lifespan as a label on eproducts can inuence purchase decisions and the in uence may vary across dif ferent products eesc when designed properly such labels can be used as a behavioral intervention to achieve the desired outcome eg promoting greener products users were less likely to choose the most energye cient television set when the european energy label was changed from a scale of at og to the scale of ato d lander and thgersen this is an example of framing a nudging strategy with undesired outcome schubert which may be avoided by carefully using behavioral insights in the process of designing interventions designing green labels for eproducts based on lifecycle impact assessment could be a challenging task given the multiplicity of product models and features in di erent eproducts which makes it di cult to compare two items research also suggests that not all product types are equally associated with ethical issues for consumers in one study consumers associated food items most strongly to ethical issues in cluding environmental whereas brown goods ie consumer electro nics such as tv and stereos were considered to have the weakest links wheale and hinton such an issue may pose as a barrier to fig elements of behavioral and technoeconomic aspects of the circular economy and potential intervention tools for behavioral changek parajuly et al resources conservation recycling x promoting green eproducts because they do not receive equal attention from consumers as for example organic food products during pur chase in addition purchase of eproducts occur much less frequently compared to other everyday consumer items this makes it more challenging to develop buying green eproducts as a proenviron mental habit in consumers circular business models consumer habits and routines formed by linear business models serve as a behavioral barrier in changing the status quo in consumption practices a transition towards the circular economy will require leveraging the power of both rational eg economic as well as non rational eg moral motives in order to change consumer habits planing this applies for mainstreaming of alternative business models such as leasing for consumer eproducts as well as for creatingdemands for refurbished and remanufactured products bittar van weelden et al v despite the potential economic and environmental bene ts of business models based on remanufacturing andor productservicesystem their adoption in industries are not widespread linder and williander remanufacturing is especially less common forconsumer products an issue that cannot be solved by traditional green marketing approach without considering behavioral aspects of the buyers vogtlander et al in addition the design of products and business models needs to expand beyond the physical characteristics inorder to encompass the human aspects of consumption wastling et al ewaste management the recast of weee directive has set a new minimum ewaste col lection target of based on the weight of eproducts put on the market during the three preceding years european parliament many countries in europe are struggling to meet this new targetwhereas stockpiling of used eproducts in households has been a major factor contributing to the lower collection and recycling rates nowakowski improper disposal and stockpiling of eol pro ducts can be partly attributed to the lack of exibility and convenience of the o cial ewaste collection systems o ered to consumers factors such as behavioral costs and environmental motivations at the individual level are therefore important which may be in uenced more eectively by social enticements than more costly structural improve ments otto et al the nature of ewaste poses additional challenges in designing be havioral interventions compared to other product and waste categories in some countries recycling behavior has become a social norm and people may be stigmatized for not recycling their household waste thomas and sharp however ewaste is a relatively new stream of waste that is usually not discarded with other household waste ewaste is perceived as valuable and clean which helps to discount the urgency factor of waste disposal partly explaining why people don t mind stockpiling eol products at home casey et al behavioral interventions aiming to improve the ewaste collection situation need to take into account these nuances within the waste collection practice it is worth mentioning here that the main objective of the weee directive is not only to facilitate recycling but also to prevent the generation of ewaste for example by the means of reuse the directive also emphasizes that the recycling and any other form of resource recovery should occur in a manner that the overall lifecycle impacts of e products are minimized it is therefore important to ensure that behavioral interventions applied to improve ewaste collection is matchedwith collection and resource recovery infrastructure that are aligned with the goals to preserve protect and improve the quality of the en vironment and human health it is also important to consider the variations in di erent geo graphical cultural and technoeconomic settings that have signi cant inuence on consumer behaviors ewaste recycling behaviors can varybecause of di erent nancial and social enticements in di erent countries structural conditions such as convenience of recycling andthe nature of eol management systems across di erent countries and regions also come into play kumar otto et al moreover recycling behaviors are shaped by personal norms that vary with peo ples knowledge and beliefs about environmental impacts as well as cultural norms that vary with ethnicity and collective values saphores et al these issues together with the more complex nature of e waste need attention in the designing of behavioral interventions to facilitate a more circular economy policy implications the role of users and impacts of their action in a circular economy have been largely ignored in policy interventions the european action plan for the circular economy european commission touches upon the need for public awareness campaigns to change behavior butit does not address the wellknown knowledgeaction gap or the psy chological and social aspects of consumption in a circular economy two other key european interventions covering eproducts weee and ecodesign directives do not include end users in their scopes on the bright side although policies traditionally have been focused on reg ulatory tools like taxes and permits behavioral elements and the fact that they can be facilitated with business models and infrastructure are increasingly becoming part of the toolbox for policy making oecd despite the ongoing debate on ethical issues nudges are becoming increasingly popular in recent years changing defaults one type ofnudging strategy has proven its strength as an alternative to economic incentives and has been the goto tool for behavioral interventions at policy level ebeling and lotz tannenbaum et al the evidence in the favor of nudging for environmental policies is strong however the application of these insights is not straightforward and needs to address the complexities of behavioral interventions to be a success moseley and stoker nudges are known to be costef fective thaler and sunstein can be designed and implemented in dierent forms and they can easily be combined with other theore tical frameworks of behavioral interventions linder et al nevertheless there is no onesize tsall behavioral solution to varying problems across the product lifecycle and therefore they require customized interventions finally although everyday consumers play an important role a transition towards the circular economy is not possible without the behavioral changes of structural actors besides reuse repair and re cycling the circular economy envisages alternative models such as access models or productservice systems that are focused more on fullling customers need than on selling more products reim et al to achieve this a collaborative approach from markets in stitutions and policy makers is crucial which requires changes in be havior of structural actors namely businesses and governments orourke and lollo the lack of collaboration among stake holders in the product lifecycle has been identi ed as a signi cant barrier in building a circular system for eproducts in the eu parajuly a proactive role of businesses and governments is therefore needed to negate the institutional barriers such as inertia and bureau cracy future research there are behavioral scientistseconomists and environmental psy chologists and then there are engineers and policy makers there is a gap between the behavioral research and the understanding of the technosphere of eproducts lifecycle this serves as a major barrier in designing behavioral interventions to promote circular economy for eproducts an awareness of behavioral elements and strategies com bined with product lifecycle system knowledge will allow designingk parajuly et al resources conservation recycling x eective interventions behavioral interventions without the knowl edge of technoeconomic aspects of circular economy and eproducts may produce insu cient or even opposite results behavioral insights alone are not enough for example to realize that the change in purchasing behavior can yield better environmental results than recycling of products byerly et al or to identify the intangible product properties that shape the reuse of eproducts makov et al on the other hand technoeconomic models alone are not enough to rea lize that the factors eg values and environmental attitudes behind waste reduction and reuse practice may not be the same as those driving the success of structured recycling schemes barr et al the nature of target behaviors can be di erent some meant to last for a long period while others may be oneo interventions should try to address behaviors considering the most relevant attributes linked tothem which may be based on part or the whole of one or more beha vioral theories although solid evidence of its success are not su cient kosters and van der heijden vetter and kutzner nud ging may carry a unique potential among the available frameworks as a novel instrument for behavioral interventions especially at the policy level stefansdotter et al nudges can also be used by other stakeholders to promote actions particularly in situations where less frequent decisionmaking is required the potential use of nudging in the context of ewaste and circular economy deserves further in vestigation it is important to emphasize that people s behaviors are linked to a whole array of infrastructural opportunities and are dictated by their surroundings therefore behavioral change interventions are not only about changing individuals consumption habits but also about creating favorable environments to perform certain actions althoughpotentially helpful in drafting e ective policies and designing costef fective infrastructure for public involvement use of behavioral insightsin technological solutions for environmental problems is not widely practiced allcott and mullainathan and even when such in itiatives are taken not having a thorough understanding of user be haviors and the science behind behavioral interventions may lead to poor application with disappointing results and loss of resources used in the initiative davis et al systematically identifying target outcomes rst and then designing behavioral interventions to achieve those contextspeci c targets may be a more realistic strategy than seeking to permanently alter generalconsumers attitudes and behaviors concerning circular economy identifying right points of intervention in the product lifecycle willrequire a thorough system understanding of product lifecycle and the related technoeconomic aspects whereas designing e ective inter vention will require sociobehavioral insights more interdisciplinaryresearch is needed in order to investigate the rationale behind users actions and the signi cance of user behaviors in product lifecycle and to explore possibilities of matching and in uencing those behaviors through interventions in the context of facilitating a more circular economy for eproducts we recommend that the future research should particularly focus on thefollowing aspects of consumer behavior a empirically understanding the challenges intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of consumer behavior to encourage their participation inthe adoption of more circular business models repairreuse prac tices and proper collection of ewaste for example understandingwhy people tend to stockpile used eproducts at home instead of discarding them in proper and timely manner b establishing a systematic and methodological approach to design and test e
