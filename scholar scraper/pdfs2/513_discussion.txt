5.1. Is there an opportunity for a circular economy (CE) on caribbean 
islands? 
Our findings reveal that the mass and economic value of embedded 
materials within e-waste have the potential to advance recycling op-
portunities in the Caribbean if one of the countries can construct a fa-
cility to serve multiple islands. The findings strongly support the 
recycling aspect of the CE. Iron, plastics, and aluminum represent the 
majority of the total mass of secondary materials (213 kt) that can be 
found in e-waste. However, the mass of precious metals (Pd, Au, and Ag) 
within e-waste is less than 1%, and more than half of the economic value 
comes from the recovery of these precious metals. Improving e-waste 
collection and recycling practices in the Caribbean would help decrease 
the imports of virgin raw materials. Recycling and treating the e-waste 
in an environmentally sound manner would also help elude the losses of 
economically valuable materials that just end up in landfills.
