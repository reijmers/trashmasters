In these regards, scholars recommend to leverage on those practices that are able to  prevent the generation of surplus food, preserving a higher share of the sustainable value. For these pre-harvest  and post-harvest practices that go under the name of prevention or reuse strategies in different FWH, technology  plays a crucial role. Through a set of 34 semi-structured interviews with technology providers as well as with companies in the agri-food supply chain, the present work investigates extensively the range of the available  technologies and the detailed objectives of such technologies for food loss and waste prevention (i.e., fore - casting, monitoring, grouping, shelf life extension, product quality and value upgrading). Moreover, different  forms of collaboration enable to reach these objectives in different ways. Collaboration with technology pro - viders can be based on continuous technical assistance and consulting for data elaboration and data analysis as well as on full data sharing and co-design, allowing to achieve a different impact on food loss and waste pre - vention.  Finally, our study reveals that the adoption of different technological options can represent the engine to  establish vertical collaborations between the adopter of the technology and another stage in the agri-food supply chain, in order to fight food waste and loss with a coordinated supply chain effort.    1. Introduction  Food waste reduction is one of the sustainability grand challenges  for food systems. Food waste derives from an ineffective management  of food surplus .  To indicate the total amount of wastage generated within different  stages of food supply chain, the terms “food losses” and “food wastes”  are commonly used .  The common expression of food loss and waste  includes a  share of total food production, that was originally intended for human  consumption, but not consumed . FLW is food that is produced, retailed or served but it is not consumed and not re - distributed to feed people, animals or used for new edible products  ( Garrone et al., 2014).  Notably, food loss is generally associated with the quantity lost  during the production, post-harvest and processing stage, whereas food  waste refer to food that is fit for human consumption but that is discarded in retail, food service or consumption stage .  In the definitions of FLW, different stages of food production are  considered, from the moment in which crops are ready for harvest until  the consumption stage . From field to  fork, postharvest losses are estimated to be the 30–40% of all food  production , which amounts to 1.3 billion tons per  year world-wide  .  Surplus food can be managed in different stages of the food supply  chain in such a way that it does not end up degrading into FLW, thus  surplus food can be recovered for human consumption or it can be prevented at the source limiting the unnecessary use of natural re - sources ( Garrone et al., 2014).  The Circular Economy  paradigm appears to be paramount in  this context as it opens up different solutions to tackle food waste that refer to practices and approaches that combine technological solutions,  behavioral and cultural changes as well as policy recommendations  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105114  Received 31 January 2020; Received in revised form 10 June 2020; Accepted 20 August 2020    ⁎Corresponding author.

In particular, Food Waste Hierarchy  frameworks suggest  different available options for organizations to tackle food waste,  identifying a set of priority actions , which  are ranked mostly from an environmental impact perspective, from the  most sound environmental option to the least one (Cristóbal et al.,  2018). Nevertheless, the actions and strategies connected with the  layers in the upper part of the FWH, i.e., food waste prevention, are  underrepresented in the current literature .  The gap in the understanding of the potential benefits of such solutions,  leads to a lack of guidance to choose the most effective technologies for  FLW prevention.  On the technological side, in the recent years the urging challenge of  food waste has represented a fertile ground for technological innova - tions. All in all, different technologies can support the valorization of food waste at different levels of the FWH ( Vandermeersch et al.,  2014a,b), thus tackling the issue while opening up new business op - portunities.  Notwithstanding the priority role assigned, the adoption of the in - novative technological solutions for food waste prevention , can bring  relevant challenges for the companies in the food supply chain. The key competences and technical expertise related to such infrastructures and  technologies (e.g., innovative food packaging or innovative process  technologies - Mourad, 2016), lie outside the agri-food supply chain,  therefore immediate and potential performance are uncertain and dif - ficult to be fully understood by agri-food players. These solutions might  end up in becoming “weak” forms of prevention, if not properly sup - ported by a shift in the business model ( Mourad, 2016). This uncertain  scenario does not clarify what are the extra efforts and costs that these  technologies might represent for some actors within the chain and  whether or not they would be compensated by extra benefits for one or  more players along the agri-food supply chain.  Hence, these technologies are just partially explored in the literature  and little is known about the implications connected to their adoption  by the players in the food supply chain. The present paper, through a  set of 34 semi-structured interviews explores i) the typologies of tech - nological solutions proposed by different technology providers for FLW  prevention; and ii) which factors stimulate or hinder their adoption  under different forms and the application within the agri-food supply  chain.  The paper develops as follows, Section 2 reports a synthetic over - view on the literature background. Section 3 present the research  questions and methodology, while Section 4 , 5 and 6 are focused on the  presentation of the results and their discussion and conclusions re - spectively.  2. Background  2.1. The sustainability challenges of food loss and waste  Food loss and waste  is a relevant issue from the social, en - vironmental and economic standpoint.  As for the economic dimension, reducing FLW represents a saving  for all the actors in the supply chain ( Chaboud and Daviron, 2017).  Notably, initiatives that tackle FLW at its roots are beneficial for food  producers that aim to sell more, but also to consumers who could have  access to available food which is more affordable (De Steur et al.,  2016). Whether and to what extent managing surplus food to prevent  FLW can outweigh the cost connected to the extra operations needed to  handle this surplus food, is still subject to a debate in the literature  .  Regarding the environmental dimension, a significant amount of  agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, energy, and water are used to  produce, then process, transport, distribute, store, and make food  available for human consumption. Consequently, FLW is also a waste of  land, water, energy and inputs . Yet, all the actions that aim not only at managing surplus food but preventing its generation, can decrease the pressure that is exerted on natural re - sources ( Timmermans et al., 2014; Chaboud and Daviron, 2017).  In addition to the important implications for the environment,  surplus food and food waste prevention can also have a considerable  impact on the society.  A reduction in the FLW generates indeed higher food security that  extends the benefits to households (Timmermans et al., 2014;   Chaboud and Daviron, 2017). When surplus food is redistributed thanks  to food aid organizations or food banks to people who normally struggle  to have access to nutritional food, food waste from a social point of  view is avoided  and thus there is a direct impact  on the social dimension. Moreover, the increasing awareness around  the so-called “food paradox”, i.e., having a large amount of food waste  in a world which is still food insecure , represents a re - levant social driver for the implementation of FLW reduction strategies.  The food that is wasted every year could indeed feed the nearly one in  nine people all over the world who suffers from hunger, especially in  developing and under-developed countries ( Godfray et al., 2010).  2.2. Circular economy and food waste management hierarchies  Circular Economy represents a compelling reference framework for  the management of food waste . Put differently,  food waste valorization options, like reduction, reuse and recycling  support the aims of the circular economy paradigm .  Food waste hierarchies, as waste hierarchies in general, represent a  powerful guidance for practitioners and policy makers to understand  possible practices to be adopted. As Table 1 exhibits, different priorities  of actions and different policies to follow for food waste management are embedded into different hierarchical frameworks that have been devel - oped after the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC ( European  Commission, 2008). In the Food Waste Hierarchy  framework  introduced by Papargyropoulou et al.  for example, the strategies  of avoiding surplus food generation as well as the strategy of reusing  surplus food for human consumption are high priority strategies because  they allow to reduce the depletion of natural resources and to limit the  negative social and ethical implications of FLW. Garrone et al.  is  aligned with the view that prevention of FLW through different redis - tribution and reuse options still targets human consumption, thus mini - mizing the waste from a social perspective. Garrone et al.  iden- tifies different reuse options (e.g., remanufacturing and repacking, sales  with promotions and discounts, sales in secondary channels as ad-hoc  distributor for surplus food) as well as redistribution, both internal to the  employees of a company and external, through the collaboration with  food aid organizations. Rood et al.  classify the different redis - tribution and reuse options, not implying reprocessing, as forms of human  food recovery . In a distinct layer in the ladder they instead consider  converting into human food, in those cases in which food products are transformed into new edible products, so they are not consumed in their  original forms. Interestingly, while most of the frameworks are aligned in  terms of available options in the lower parts of the waste hierarchy  (ranging from recycling of food products into not-edible alternatives,  food recovery for the generation of energy and then incineration and  disposal) some differences can be found moving up the waste hierarchy.  When referring to prevention policies Garrone et al.  and   Vandermeersch et al.  refer to the prevention of food waste and loss, and not the reduction or avoidance of surplus food. This approach  focuses on avoiding the post harvest losses and thus considering the  possible generation of food waste from the moment in which food pro - ducts are ready to be harvested ( Chaboud and Daviron, 2017). The Food  Recovery Hierarchy  esplicitly considers the reduction of the volume of surplus  food generated as the strategy having highest priority. As a whole, extant  food waste hierarchies focus primarly on priorities of actions to manage  surplus food, considering harvesting losses as unavoidable, hence F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 2 devoting less attention to non-yields or less productivity in the farming  operations .  Nevertheless, especially the upstream stages of the food supply  chain have the greatest potentials to prevent the generation of food  surplus through new infrastructures, skills as well as storage and  transportation technologies .  2.3. The technologies for surplus food prevention and management in the  agri-food industry  Technology is a fundamental element in the CE framework, which  claims for socially radical and technologically advanced solutions to  create effective circular patterns . This is true  especially for translating the CE frameworks in the food industry into  specific actions, which requires the support of the technology for any  layers in the FWH. Notably, the role of technology to prevent and  manage surplus food is recognized as pivotal in moving up the food  waste hierarchy, thus offering innovative tools to support companies in  the top and high-priority layers of the food waste hierarchy. Tech - nology not only has a crucial role in the conversion of waste, but, most  importantly, in the prevention of useless extraction of raw materials  ( Nilsen, 2019). For example, information technologies can facilitate  food sharing and redistribution via web platforms or apps  . Instead, strategies for effectively manage surplus  food, once surplus food is generated, are generally linked to transfor - mation technologies, since they deal with processing the surplus food in  order to obtain animal feeding, fertilizers or energy ( Arshadi et al.,  2016; ReFED, 2016, Laufenberg et al., 2003, Girotto et al., 2015).  Nevertheless, the implications deriving from the adoption of technologies for surplus food prevention are disregarded in literature. In  fact, literature mostly focuses on tackling food waste from the moment  agricultural products are ready for harvest (Chaboud and  Daviron, 2017), while a limited body of contributions analyze more in  depth the adoption of technologies to prevent the generation of surplus  food in the pre-harvesting phase.  As a whole, the agri-food context represents a fertile ground for the  development of technological solutions to prevent and manage surplus  food, spanning all the layers in the food waste hierarchy.  The high perishability of food products indeed has led to the  emergence of new technologies that allow to extend the shelf life of the  products, both through packaging technologies to enhance and extend  conservation  and through ad-hoc storage systems  .  The high intrinsic recoverability of some food products in parti - cular, as fruits and vegetables ( Garrone et al., 2014), together with the  high potential of their byproducts to be re-processed opens up to ad - ditional transformation technologies to obtain a new edible derivative  product ( Galanakis, 2012).  Interestingly, new technologies can also help prior to the harvesting  phase, through precision agriculture solutions that can represent po - tentially innovative technologies not just considered from a system productivity point of view, but also to prevent surplus food pre-harvest  as well as to fight food insecurity ( Ambler-edwards et al., 2009) .  The picture of the available technological solutions is variegated.  Different technological options are currently not analyzed in terms of  their actual applicability in the food eco-system as well as in terms of  impact on food waste and loss reduction as well as from an extended  sustainability perspective. More in general, as technology is fast Table 1  Different food waste hierarchies presented in the literature      Name of the framework Levels in the hierarchy (from most preferable to least  preferable) References   Waste hierarchy  a) Prevention   b) Preparing for re-use   c) Recycling   d) Other recovery    e) Disposal   Food waste hierarchy   Food waste management hierarchy  a) Avoid   b) Reduce   c) Reuse   d) Recover   e) Treat   f) Dispose   Food recovery hierarchy  a) Source reduction   b) Feed hungry people   c) Feed animals   d) Industrial uses   e) Composting   Availability-Surplus-Recoverability-Waste Model    a) Recover surplus food to feed humans   b) Recover surplus food to feed animals   c) Waste recovery   d) Waste disposal   Food waste management hierarchy  a) Prevention   b) Conversion for human nutrition   c) Use of animal feed   d) Use as raw materials in industry   e) Process into fertilizer   f) Use as a renewable energy   g) Incineration   h) Landfill   Moerman's Ladder  a) Preventing food losses   b) Human food   c) Converted into human food    d) Used in animal feed   e) Use as raw materials in industry   f) Process into fertilizer through fermentation   g) Process into fertilizer through composting   h) Applied for sustainable energy   i) Incineration  F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 3 developing and the urgency of FLW prevention is recent, there is a need  to further understand which role technology can play in moving up on  the ladder of the food waste hierarchy.  2.4. Collaboration as a key aspect of technology adoption for FLW  prevention  As for many other technological innovations in the supply chain, also  food waste prevention technologies benefit in their implementation from the collaboration of actors along the value chain .  Several technological innovations that aim to create an impact on different  sustainability dimensions are enabled by collaboration with multiple sta - keholders. Technological innovations considering management systems based on time–temperature measurement in the context of the cold chain  ( Mercier et al., 2017), traceability systems in agriculture (Chen and  Yada, 2011) new technological infrastructure to support information ex - change in the meat supply chain ( Lehmann et al., 2012), for example, are  all presented in the literature as challenged by the implementation of the proper collaborative environment. Closer collaborations among actors that  perform different types of activities along the supply chain (e.g. proces - sing, storage, transportation technologies and agriculture) are considered of pivotal importance to promote sustainable food supply chains and  tackle grand challenges like the FLW ( Alamar et al., 2018).  With reference to technological innovations tackling the specific  issue of FLW, they need to confront with the complex ecosystem of  actors represented by the food supply chain .  This ecosystem includes both companies operating in the same  supply chain stage, that are generally direct competitors, and compa - nies operating in different stages ( Gellynck and Kühne, 2010).  The food supply chain ecosystem has to face a considerable power  unbalance between the different supply chain actors (Taylor and  Fearne, 2006); there is a high risk of having a loss for a supply chain  partner  which is greater than the  benefits for another supply chain partner (Rutten, 2013; Chaboud and  Daviron, 2017). According to Mena et al.  the root causes of FLW  lie in the interfaces of different supply chain stages, with the down - stream ones  being particularly relevant because the food product carries a con - siderable added value from an environmental and an economic point of  view at these stages ( Mena et al., 2011). Good practices to solve the  FLW issue need therefore to be sought in collaborative processes and  through information sharing, but also reliable storage and shelf life  management systems (e.g. sales through alternative channels, sales  with discounted prices) .  Such complex set of dynamics is undoubtedly relevant to under - stand how to effectively move towards hands-on applications to effec - tively fight FLW. Most of the analyzed studies refer to root causes identification of FLW (e.g., Mena et al., 2011 , Garrone et al, 2014), but  remedies to such issues are rarely investigated in terms of technological  applications. Moreover, when real case studies are presented   or real companies are involved in the discussion,  the technological aspect is often missing in favor of motivational and  organizational analyses.  3. Materials and methods  3.1. Research questions  Through the present study we aim at contributing to a better un - derstanding of the role of technological solutions in surplus food pre - vention and management, i.e in the application of circular economy  principles to the agri-food ecosystem. Yet, the focus is on the higher  priority layers of the food waste hierarchies, which allow to preserve  both social and environmental value.  The context is represented by the fruits and vegetables segment. On a  global level, these productions weight around one third of the overall purchases of fruit and vegetables from the downstream stages of the supply chain and in particular, households, food service and retail  businesses ( De Laurentiis et al., 2018). This segment, accounts for almost  the 50% of the waste generated in households, food service and retail stages due to the rapid decay of these fresh food products that shorten  their shelf-life . FAO   estimated that around 45% of the overall production of fruit and vege - tables end up being wasted . In terms of  economic value lost with the wastage of fruits and vegetables from the  harvesting phase until the distribution (retail, food service and con - sumption excluded), this value is around 21% of the total amount of  fruits and vegetable produced on a global scale ( FAO, 2019). Instead, the  amount of food loss and waste  is on average slightly more than 10% of  the overall food loss and waste quantity .  In the Italian context, the quantity of fruit and vegetables wasted at  the retail stage is the highest compared to other food product (i.e., a  total of 24 tons of fruits and vegetables wasted per year)  . Moreover, at the households and transforma - tion stage of the supply chain, fruits and vegetables are among the first  three product categories per food waste generated ( Giordano et al.,  2016, Grosso and Falasconi, 2018).  Thus fruits and vegetables segments presents high potentials to  prevent the generation of surplus food , but this would require new infrastructural and technological solutions  .  The focus on “technology” is here intended to include not only di - gital and processing technologies, but also packaging and conservation  technologies. The different types of solutions are adopted by different  actors in the fruits and vegetables supply chain, which can be described  as in Fig. 1 .  In light of the above discussed challenges and the lack of an ex - tensive understanding on the pre-harvest and post-harvest technolo - gical solutions to prevent and manage surplus food, our guiding re - search questions are the following:  RQ1 : How does technology enable surplus food prevention along  the fruit and vegetables supply chain?  In order to provide a rich taxonomy of such technologies, we focus  not only on i) the type of technological solutions, but also on ii) the  different objectives with respect to food waste prevention pursed by the  technology; and iii) the supply chain stage that represents the main user  of the technological solution.  RQ2: How does the collaboration with technology providers or  between supply chain stages allow to address different objectives with  respect to FLW prevention?  Hence, we observed and analyzed different ways in which compa - nies along the food supply chain adopt the investigated technologies,  thus focusing on the relationships in place between the technology  providers and the food companies. The technological solutions analyzed  can be adopted by different stages of the agri-food supply chain or,  when adopted in a single stage, their benefit can expand in other stages  as well. Therefore, they can create the proper ground to initiate dyadic  vertical collaborations (i.e. collaboration between two stages of the  agri-food supply chain), which are particularly effective when dealing  with a supply chain-wide issue as food waste ( Garrone et al., 2012).  Therefore, technology is here investigated with a different value as - signed to its role of antecedent, depending on the different forms of  collaboration that it enables.  3.2. Methodology  3.2.1. Case selection  Given the nature of our research questions and in order to compare  an extensive number of cases looking for both similarities and differ - ences across them to reach an extensive taxonomy multiple semi-  structured interviews have been adopted as a research method. Semi- F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 4 structured interviews are based on a predetermined list of questions but  they leave space to the participants to expose issues and comments  . The unit of analysis is represented  by dyad: technology supplier and its costumer, i.e. the adopter of the technology, which is represented by the company in the food supply  chain (i.e. farms and producers, cooperatives of producers, manu - facturers, retailers) targeting food waste reduction with the support of a  technological solution and a corresponding technology provider. The  target companies have been scouted thanks to the participation to two  main events: a trade fair taking place in Italy in May 2018 (i.e., Macfrut  2018) and Seeds and Chips Summit. The former is an important trade  fair that aimed at professionals operating in the fruit and vegetables  sector, among which technology providers are prevailing. The latter, is  an international event hosts yearly an interesting pool of young ven - tures in the agri-food supply chain. Additionally, companies have been  scouted online by secondary sources and with a short preparatory in - terview to understand the suitability of a specific technology to address  the goal of food waste reduction.  With the aim of achieving an extensive taxonomy a total of 34  structured interviews have been developed, with 13 interviews con - ducted with the twofold perspective of the supplier of the technology  and the partner within the food supply chain, while 21 interviews have  been conducted with the sole perspective of the technology supplier.  We selected the companies applying a stratification purposeful sam - pling of the set of companies originally scouted, in order to capture a variety of technologies and detailed objectives connected to food waste  prevention and thus to favor the comparison among subgroups  . We are aware of the rapid evolution and  the variegated nature of such technological solutions, so our purpose is  not to develop a taxonomy that aims to be exhaustive of all the possible  technological solutions in the field, but a first satisfactory picture of the  available options of technologies to prevent food waste and losses in the  fruits and vegetables segment. The high number of interviews served  this objective.  3.2.2. Data collection and data analysis  Data have been collected in 2018 through direct interviews con - ducted at least by two researchers. As reported in Appendix A, the in - terviewees are represented by Founders, Co-Founders and Managing  Directors when dealing with start-ups or small sized companies (for  instance Company R and S), Product Managers, R&D Managers,  Account Managers and Sales Manager when dealing with larger firms  . Primary sources of information have been collected with a questionnaire addressing i) a description of the features of the technological solution and the supply chain stage the  technology is conceived for; ii) relationship with the client companies:  main features requested by the customers, main reason why the tech - nology is chosen; iii) the relationship with food waste prevention ob - jectives and therefore to what extent the impact in terms of FLW is  actually perceived as one key performance by customers. Sections ii)  and iii) were also present in the interview protocol with the main client  company (i.e. the adopter of the technology within the agri-food supply  chain). This twofold perspective allows us to validate the findings on  the impact on food waste reduction and also on analysing different  forms of collaboration.  Secondary sources have been adopted to complete the descriptive  information collected from the technology providers. Coding have been performed by the members of the research team independently  reaching convergence on doubtful aspects. Each researcher has shared  his/her own results through a brainstorming session with the others, so  to eliminate subjectivity and to ensure internal validity (Seuring and  Gold 2012). Moreover, researchers relied on follow-up interviews in  case of missing information which lead to struggle in reaching con - vergence. Interviews have been coded with an hybrid inductive/de - ductive approach  deriving main topics of the  research domain with a deductive approach, while set of codes have  been derived inductively by collected data in order to expand the topics  inductively defined . The code book was devel - oped both for descriptive purposes in order to build the taxonomy (i.e.  to describe synthetically the analyzed technology and to assess the  objective of the technology with respect to food waste) as well as for  explanatory purpose and thus to differentiate different roles of ante - cedents for the collaborations that reinforce the impact on food waste reduction. When considering the antecedents of collaborations, the in - formation collected have been triangulated and enriched with the point of view of the food company which is the main adopter of the tech - nology. The coding process followed therefore the key dimensions in relation with RQ1 and RQ2, as reported in Appendix B.  4. Analysis of the results  4.1. A taxonomy of technologies to prevent and manage surplus food  With reference to RQ1, the technologies adopted by the companies   have been  classified according to the following dimensions: i) type of  Fig. 1. Reference framework for the fruits and vegetables supply chain  F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 5 technologies; ii) objectives with respect to the reduction of FLW; iii)  supply chain stage of the client company. Moreover, we integrated this  classification with a more in-depth analysis of the technological solu - tions, differentiating them first of all in terms of maturity of the  technology in the market . We distinguished between, i) consolidated  technologies, namely technologies with more than 5 years of com - mercial applications of the specific or similar technologies in the in - dustry, ii) cutting edge technological innovation ; iii) Limited  market diffusion, for those technology which are not considered cut - ting-edge but have a limited application in the specific segment.  Secondly, the type of investment needed by the target user in the  food supply chain to adopt it (i.e., main capital and operational ex - penditures that the user would need to bear).  Table 2 and Table 3 summarizes the classification of the different  technologies.  As regards the different types of technological solutions, we dis - tinguish between: information systems and analytics, chemical preserva - tion, mechanical preservation and processing.  Information systems and analytics are those technological solutions  which rely on data collection systems to limit overproduction, identify causes of non-compliance and target products in the appropriate  market, thus pursuing as objectives: forecasting, monitoring and  grouping. For example, Company I develops a forecasting system based  on machine learning algorithm application for the forecast of both offer  and demand for fruits and vegetables. Moreover, Company M provides  sensors that measure field and exogenous parameters (i.e. earth tem - perature, moisture, humidity, rain level, wind speed and direction) to  help farmers in responding more precisely to the market demand in  term of quantity and to avoid overproduction. Chemical preservation  refers to chemical substances that, applied to fruits and vegetables di - rectly and / or through active packaging, lengthen their shelf-life and  improve their quality. An example is represented by Company E, which is able to slow down the ripening process and obtain a better quality of  the fruits and an extended shelf life through the application of a specific  molecule on climacteric fruits (i.e. fruits that continue the metabolic  processes also after the harvesting). Mechanical preservation refers in - stead to conservation and transportation systems which are able to control specific parameters (e.g. temperature, O 2 level) with the aim of  expanding the shelf life. Company Q offers storage technologies in controlled atmosphere with the aim of extending the shelf life of apples  and pears.  Processing technology allows to develop reuse practices. These  technologies are offered to manufacturers with the aim to transform  fresh products, as fruits and vegetables, into other finished products like  snacks, soups, fruits juices, etc. The objective of the technology with respect to food waste looked at  different set of actions that can be implemented to reduce FLW, namely: forecasting, monitoring, grouping and sorting, better conservation for shelf  life extension, product quality and value upgrading. Type of technology  and the objective of the technology with respect to food waste are  strictly correlated, since information systems and analytics can be used  for the forecasting, monitoring, grouping and flow managing activities,  chemical and mechanical preservation can be used for shelf-life ex - tension and quality upgrading. Finally, processing is used for product value upgrading (i.e., the outcome of the processing phase is a pro - cessed food product, different from the original fresh food).  The supply chain stages refer to the supply chain of fresh products   and thus: farming, conservation and packing,  manufacturing, transportation and retail.  As shown in Table 2 , the farming stage is the one in which in - formation system and analytics technologies are prevailing, to support  precision agriculture methodologies. In the packing stage, information  system and analytics are acquiring relevance, covering all the four  objectives, with the prevailing attention for grouping and/or sorting.  However, even if in a reduced way, this type of technology is present in  all the supply chain stages with exception of the manufacturing one. In  the post-harvesting stages mechanical preservation technologies are  widespread in order to preserve the product as long as possible and  avoiding to reach the “sell-by date” before reaching the retail stage and  the final consumers. Retailers instead prefer chemical preservation  options on the fresh products, in order to “ prolong the reduction of the  ripening process also on the consumers’ shelves” .  Processing technology is intuitively present only in the manu - facturing stage and it has the potential to create value from commonly  not-profitable products (i.e., fruits and vegetable products not com - pliant to market standards and requirements).  Finally, the analysis on the maturity of the technology and the in - vestments needed by the adopter in the food supply chain, revealed  that, in terms of the maturity of the technology, the picture is var - iegated for all the different types of technologies, while the investments  needed by the food supply chain actors are different from one type of  technology to the other. In the information systems and analytics ca - tegory there are cutting-edge technology, which include data collection devices like drones and cameras, advanced predictive algorithms based  on machine learning approach for data analysis and innovative alter - natives to traditional mechanical sorting.

As a  whole, while information systems and analytics require investments in  hardware and software, the other types of technology would instead  require investments in additives and devices.  4.2. Different ways to address the different objectives with respect to food  waste prevention  By performing a qualitative grouping based on i) the type of tech - nology, ii) the objective of the technology with respect to surplus food and iii) the potential impact on food waste reduction, jointly, three  main groups can be identified. The groups present some distinctive  features with respect to the main levers adopted to tackle food waste  but also with respect to other descriptive characteristics, as described in   Table 4 .  Within each group, companies are classified looking at the different  levers they adopt to tackle food waste reduction, differentiating po - tential impact on food waste reduction from a more direct impact.  With a potential impact we mean that food waste can still be gen - erated by several other root causes that the technology is not able to tackle, whereas a more direct impact means that the technology is able  to address more than one cause determining food waste or that the  specific cause of food waste is closed to the critical interface of the agri-  food supply chain   ( Mena et al., 2011).  Moreover, as a bridge for our second research intent, we also ob - served different ways in which companies along the food supply chain  adopt the investigated technologies, with a focus on how different  forms of collaborations can enable or reinforce the effectiveness of the  technology in addressing the different objectives with respect to FLW  prevention (reported in Table 2 ).  Collaborations between a company in the agri-food supply chain  and the technology provider can contribute to the achievement of the  different objectives with respect to food waste prevention in four dif - ferent ways that are not mutually exclusive.  First of all, in the simplest scenario, the technology is just  “adopted”, meaning that the relationship in place is the traditional buyer-supplier relationship, with the technological solution that is sold “off-the shelf” and the technology provider supports only for operating the technology for the first time. In a second scenario, the establishment  of a relationship with the technology provider is based on continuous  technical assistance with the customer or assistance in case of any issue  occurring during the life cycle of the technology. A third type of col - laboration is represented by a more intense relationship based on full integration of data and/or co-design between the two parties. Finally,  the fourth scenario, represents a dyadic vertical collaboration between  the agri-food company adopting the technology and another agri-food  company in another stage of the supply chain.  The three groups of companies and related technological solutions  introduced in Table 3 can be discussed in light of both the impact on  food waste reduction as well as in terms of the role of the collaboration  to reinforce the impact.  In group 1 there are information systems and analytics technologies  adopted with the aim of monitoring and forecasting the productivity of  the harvesting process, having real time information in order to act in a timely fashion for any issues that might deteriorate the product quality  and also to match production with demand, thus avoiding over - production in field, extra-stocks in warehouses or leftovers at the points  of sale. As depicted in Fig. 2 , these three different levers span from a  more potential impact on food waste reduction (pre-harvesting inter - vention) to a more direct one, connected to an effective match between  supply and demand.  In this group most of the companies in the agri-food supply chain  rely on the technology providers for technical assistance to support the  elaboration and interpretation of data. Only in one case   the relationship with the supplier is in the form of a full integration of  information in order to design ad-hoc forecasting application based on  artificial intelligence.  Moreover, as reported in Table 4 , a common trait that these com - panies share is represented by the target of their offering, which is re - presented by farmers, packing houses and in by transportation com - panies. All the companies in this group have started to internationalize either through foreign direct investment or simply exporting their so - lutions without any clear trends in these regards.  In group 2 there are information systems and analytics -based  technologies which have grouping as the main objective. The three  companies in this group rely either on an automated and intelligent  sorting process that help, not only to estimate the overall processing  time, thus allowing the fruit to reach the shelves sooner, but also to  target the right market segment for fruits of different quality, thus  Table 4  Three groups of technological solutions with common leverages on food waste reduction        Group 1 Group 2 Group 3   Companies  A, C, D, M, N, R, S, T B, J, P, U E, F, H, K, L, Q, O  Type of technology Information systems and analytics Information systems and analytics Chemical/Mechanical preservation/  Processing  Objective of the technology with  respect to food waste prevention Monitoring/Forecasting Grouping Shelf life extension/quality upgrading/  product value upgrading  Main levers to tackle food waste  (from potential to more direct  impact on food waste reduction)  • Prevent at the source  controlling and forecasting potential factors causing quality deterioration   • Help decision making to solve issues causing food waste in a timely fashion   • Match production with demand along different stages of the agri-food supply chain through advanced forecasting  systems  • Manage production planning in line with  market demand  • Speed up sorting, shortening the food product processing time   • Address the proper market for the most  suitable product thus diminishing  rejections at the final stage of the supply  chain)  • Pre-harvest intervention on the product  quality   • Improve organoleptic /aesthetics characteristics of the product post-harvest (diminishing rejections at the final stage of  the supply chain)   • Allow to better bear any transportation  routes increasing the share of products that arrive with good quality on the retailer's  shelves  Distinctive features of the companies  in the group  • Addressing upstream stages of the fruit  and vegetables supply chain and transportation   • Operating in international market through Foreign Direct Investments and Exports  • Addressing manufacturers  • Operating in international market through Foreign Direct Investments    • Addressing upstream stages of the fruit  and vegetables supply chain and retail  • Operating in international market through  Exports and Foreign Direct Investment when  co-design is in place F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 8 reducing the impact of rejections at the final stage of the supply chain.  In terms of relationships with the customers, both company B and P  base these relationships on a close technical assistance to their custo - mers in order to operate the technology for the first time and to support them in case of any technical issues. Moreover, the technology enables a virtuous vertical collaboration along the agri-food supply chain. For  company P for example, the innovative sorting technology enables a  collaboration between a medium-size producer and an important ex - porter, in order to sort premium type of kiwis and thus reducing scraps for non-conformity with the standards imposed by the exporter.  Fig. 2. Enriched taxonomy of technologies for food waste prevention  F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 9 Company J is a peculiar case in the group, with a technology to  support the production planning process to reduce overproduction,  with a highly customizable software for agri-food businesses. In this  case the solution is co-designed with the customer in order to develop a  tailor-made application.  Distinctive features of these groups of technology providers is re - presented by the fact that three out of the four companies in the group   address food manufacturers and they all operate  in international context by direct investments and not by simple export,  because of the need to provide technical assistance close to their main  international customers. Company J instead is young Italian venture  addressing mostly packing houses and farmers that has not yet inter - nationalized.  Finally, in group 3 , we have chemical and mechanical preservation  technologies which aim at extending the shelf life, upgrade the product quality and to assign a new  value to a product. The quality  upgrade is achieved both by acting on the pre-harvesting phase for  example through specific nutrients and bio-stimulants which are able to  modify a key aesthetic feature as the size or post-harvesting avoiding  preservation disorders . Moreover, thanks to  transportation carried out in controlled atmosphere conditions, fruits  and vegetables can bear longer transportation journeys or can be sold  for a longer sales window. In this group most of the companies develop  a relationship with the customer based on a technical support to im - plement the technology for the first time. Just in two cases  the solutions is co-designed with the customers and  there is a continuous exchange of feedbacks even after the first oper - ationalization of the technology. This is justified by the need to custo - mize the parameters to establish the specific dosage of bio-stimulants or  the need to regulate the controlled atmosphere conditions on the basis  of specific customer/market requirements or on the basis of the tech - nical considerations of the agronomist of the agri-food company.  Interestingly, for this group of companies, the prevailing orientation  for what concerns internationalization is represented by export  strategy, whereas only for companies O and L the internationalization is  undergone through direct investment, thus supporting the co-design of  the solutions, the trials in field by operating close to the main custo - mers.  4.3. Implementing collaborations to reinforce the impact of technology for  food waste prevention  The different types of collaborations in place are supported by dif - ferent antecedents identified by technology providers and that have been validated and enriched by the actor in the agri-food supply chain  stage adopting the technology, as outlined in Table 5 .  Companies in the agri-food supply chain are pushed to adopt the  different technological solutions because they lack of internal compe - tences to develop such technological innovations and to exploit com - pletely their potentials. Therefore, by adopting the technology, they  gain access to ad hoc competences. Companies in the agri-food supply  chain have understood the increasing importance of some technological  trends within the industry and they perceive the importance to be ex - posed to state-of-the-art innovations to win the increasing competition  as well as to receive an effective and continuous technical assistance  and consulting on data elaboration and analysis, as well as further in - sights for the next directions of technological development.  Company Food1 for example, has identified in the adoption of the  technology provided by Company B a way to “fit with the quality/cost  trade-off the market asks for, but having an important window to scout state-  of-the art technologies in the sorting process”.  On the other hand, technology providers do not have a specific  knowledge for specific processes of the food supply chain and they need  the participation of their customers to improve technological effec - tiveness. Company Food 4, which is a packing house managed by a cooperative of farmers and which is the main recipients for the technological solution proposed by Company C, emphasizes the im - portance of the technical external knowledge, not only as the main  driver to adopt a new technology, but also as the key reason to establish  a collaboration with the technology supplier based on data elaboration  and analysis “the lack of knowledge is the major barrier to spread the drone  technology. For farmers is impossible to deal with this great amount of data alone.  collaboration with technology suppliers is fundamental to ac - quire the ability to read such data” .  In some cases  the collaboration between the  technology provider and the customer is based on full data sharing  or on co-design of a tailor-made solution for a particular  customer or food products.  Moreover, in our sample, a set of cases highlights how technology  for surplus food prevention and management can represent the engine  to initiate or develop further a collaboration between different supply  chain actors. This is a desirable situation for a set of companies whereas  is already actually implemented for another set of companies in the  agri-food supply chain. Nevertheless, the unbalanced power in favor of  downstream companies of the food supply chain does not favor a ver - tical collaboration among different agri-food supply chain players. For  instance, downstream stages of the food supply chain could potentially  exploit the greater benefits connected to the shelf life extension of fruits  and vegetables as well as a better inventory planning to respond to the  market demand.  Nevertheless, the perception of other players within the supply  chain is that the sharing of these benefits through a better redistribution  of the extra margin generated, is one of the main barriers preventing  them from the collaboration with downstream players. As stated by  Food 12: “ The price of fruits is equal to thirty year ago, but the advent of this  technological innovations would require an additional investment for us which means higher costs and an even lower profit." (Office environmental  sustainability and certification, Food 12).  5. Discussion  Reduction of FLW at each stage of the agri-food supply chain passes  through the implementation of a CE approach .  Technological solutions are one but fundamental piece of such ap - proach. Our study proposes a taxonomy of possible technological so - lutions that clarifies the portfolio of technological options that are  available for the different stages of the agri-food supply chain, with  particular reference to the fruits and vegetables segment. The different  technological solutions are linked to the different objectives to reach  FLW reduction, then clarifying how different types of collaborations can  reinforce the reaching of the different objectives pursued by the tech - nological solutions. We have therefore enriched the discussion around the CE approach to tackle the challenge of FLW with some keys ele - ments related to: i) an overview of the state-of-the art technologies available to move up the FWH and to translate the concept of “pre - vention” in hands-on applications that are currently on the market; ii) the potential role of such technologies in limiting the loss of sustainable  value embedded in food products; iii) how collaborations with tech - nology providers and vertical supply chain collaborations can facilitate the effectiveness of the technologies to reach FLW objectives.  It must be said that, in our overview of the possible solutions, we  have excluded “redistribution” (i.e. distribution of edible food to people  in need) as an option, although it is a high priority practice especially  for the social impact that it generates. Technologies are available also  for supporting the challenging operations and logistics activities con - nected with the execution of such strategy, but they are mostly in the  form of apps or web-platforms facilitating the effective communication  among actors involved in the redistribution cycle and they can hence be  considered less state-of-the art technologies.  Moreover, moving down the ladder, despite the positive impact  connected to the avoidance of the social impact of food waste, proces - sing technologies can be considered lower priority for the F. Ciccullo, et al.   Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 10 environmental impact. If indeed this technological solution and the set  of supporting activities are implemented in supply chain stages that are  progressively closer to the final market, they increase the negative  environmental externalities generated by the management of surplus  food.  Finally, we have gone in depth in exploring the ecosystem that re - presents the key locus of innovation to face the grand challenges con - nected to sustainability and CE in the agri-food industry, which is re - presented by the “extended” agri-food supply chain, in which  technology providers are integral parts. We are contributing to extant  debate in the literature connected to how to translate the CE paradigm  in practice, with a specific focus on those actions incorporated in the  higher layers of the FWH that allow to save most of the sustainable  value. Hence, i) we confirm the importance of collaborations to effec - tively implement the CE paradigm ( Dora, 2019) and ii) we shed lights  on how the transition to a fully circular approach in the whole agri-food  supply chain is far from straightforward, given the complex set of re - lationship in the agri-food ecosystem ( Taylor and Fearne, 2006).  As for the first point, interestingly, some additional considerations  emerge. The different types of relationships established with the tech - nology providers do not present an option that revealed to be the most effective in terms of impact on FLW prevention. Nevertheless, as shown  in Fig. 3 , the different types of collaborations seem to be used to achieve  different specific objectives within the higher-level objective of fos - tering an effective implementation of the technology and the CE para - digm.  On the one hand, establishing a relationship with the technology  supplier that imply technical assistance is linked with the objective to  bridge a gap in the competences and skills of the main adopter of the  technology, which might lack of the competences to interpret and  analyze the data collected by a specific technology in the category in- formation systems and analytics or might need to be supported to fully  understand the value of a cutting-edge technological solution related to  chemical preservation . On the other hand, establishing a relationship  with the technology provider oriented towards higher integration (i.e.,  the relationship based on full data sharing and co-design with the  adopted) is justified by the need of some specific technologies to be  “tailor-made” and to effectively target the goal connected to FLW re - duction. Interestingly, when there is this specific need, geographic  closeness appears to be paramount as well. The technology providers  need to provide not only continuous technical assistance but need to get  to know the peculiarities of the processes characterizing the adopter in  deep details. This is witnessed e.g. by the choice of companies like O, L  and I to pursue internationalization through direct investments, which are mostly justified by the need to have after-sales but also R&D divi - sions that are close to the clients.  As for the latter contribution to the debate around the shift of the  food supply chain with an end-to-end perspective to effectively imple - ment the CE paradigm, we have pointed out that vertical collaborations  are necessary conditions to exploit the full potential of some cutting-  hedge technology. The vertical collaborations that would be enabled by  the technological solutions would allow to apply FLW prevention at its  roots by favoring the match between supply and demand. Nevertheless,  we also derived that the orchestration of resources to implement such  transition in the food supply chain is far from straightforward.  We have indeed underlined how upstream companies in such supply  chain are more prone to search for the possibility to create stable re - lationships with downstream actors, in order to assure profit and to  invest in technological solutions having a more balanced distribution of  cost and benefits. On the other hand, downstream stages should be  aware of the importance to share benefits and risk with upstream  companies and to shift to an “end to end” perspective to quantify  productivity as well as impact on food waste.  6. Conclusion  From the theoretical point of view, our findings represent an initial  answer to the call of Chaboud and Daviron  to enlarge the scope of  surplus food prevention and management distinguishing pre and post  harvesting solutions. Moreover, we have enriched the hierarchical fra - mework proposed in literature  ;   Rood et al. ) to translate the CE paradigm into practices and ap - proaches that develop around technological solutions, focused objectives  and collaborations to serve the scope of the prevention and partially the  reuse layers .   Fig. 4 represents our proposal of and “Extended Food Waste Hierarchy”.  This extension is to interpret both in terms of a more detailed overview of  the possible options for the prevention layer, but also in terms of different  supply chain stages that the technologies can address. The technological  solutions investigated cover well the agronomics and packing phases of  the agri-food value chain, while manufacturing and distribution phases  are covered to a minor extent. The same holds true for the consumption  stage, which, although highly important to the overall amount of food  waste generated ( De Laurentiis et al., 2018; FAO, 2019) has not been  included in the study, given that the study of consumer behaviours would  have required a completely different research design.  As for managerial implications, this work, makes two main con - tributions for practitioners. First, through our taxonomy we derive a Table. 5  Types of collaboration and antecedents       Type of collaboration in place Antecedent Cited as a driver by (# of occurrences/tot number of  cases for the specific type of  collaboration) %    Simple adoption of the technology  by the single agri-food supply chain stage / the TP  supports to operate the technology for the first  time Limited effort from the customer side to understand and operate the technology   E,F,G,U   75%  Collaboration between TP and a customer based on  continuous technical assistance and support in  data elaboration and analysis Access to consulting and technical assistance deriving  from the lack of knowledge of appropriate methods  and skills to fully exploit the benefit of the technology   A,B,C,D,H, M,N,P,R,S,T 84,6%   Refinement of the technology collection of feedback from suppliers Q, K 15,4%  Collaboration between TP and customer based on full  data sharing/ co-design Access expertise that could open up future  opportunities for the research and development of  state-of-the-art technologies I,J,K 60%   Access to a highly customized technology L,O 40%  Technology to enable vertical collaborations between  different supply chain stages In order to take full advantage of the technology, the actors in the supply chain are encouraged to gain  visibility on critical information (e.g. available /  requested quantity and quality standards) E, F, K, Q, R, S , B, P, J (already  implemented) 100% F. Ciccullo, et al.    Resources, Conservation & Recycling 164  105114 11 sort of compass to support companies in the adoption of new technol - ogies for surplus food prevention and management. Secondly, we have  enriched this tool with indications on the role of collaboration along  among supply chain actors in order to unleash the full potentials of the  technology and obtain an end-to-end impact on the agri-food supply  chain.  Finally, although an extensive analysis is a preferred approach when  the goal is to derive a taxonomy of possible solutions, there are some  limitations to be pointed out. First and foremost, as remarked in the   Section 3 , our purpose was not to develop a taxonomy that aims to be  exhaustive of all the possible technological solutions in the field, but a  first satisfactory picture of the available options of technologies to  prevent FLW in the fruits and vegetables segment. Most of the technology providers are Italian, whereas as small group is from United States and United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the geographical context  didn't mark any significant difference/peculiarity in the taxonomy, not  underlining any specific technological focus of a certain countries.  Moreover, some interesting dynamics regarding collaborations be - tween technology providers and vertical collaborations along the agri-  food supply chain deserve a more in-depth exploration.  Another main limitation of the study is represented by the fact that  the extent of the impact on FLW prevention and the related sustain - ability impact are measured just qualitatively and in terms of potential and not actual measured impact on FLW prevention. This point would  instead deserve a further quantitative assessment with an ex-post  measurement of the impact of different food waste prevention tech - nology to better support our considerations.  Finally, the twofold perspective of the technology provider and the  main adopter of the technology could represent another interesting setting for future research avenues.
