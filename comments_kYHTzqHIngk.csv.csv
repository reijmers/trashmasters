This is pretty much how things are everywhere outside of the U.S. and Canada. But if you tried to implement the scanner system in the U.S., the theft would be astronomical. 90% of what people took out of the store would not be paid for."

2022-07-18T23:48:31Z,2022-07-18T23:48:31Z,2,I wanna live in Amsterdam so bad üò¢
2022-07-10T03:44:27Z,2022-07-10T03:44:27Z,0,"Yeah, in the northwest of the US, it&#39;s a 30 minute walk from my apartment to the nearest affordable grocery store, QFC; 20 to 30 minutes away by bus because my neighborhood is serviced by one of the shittiest bus lines in the city. (There&#39;s a convenience store 8 minutes&#39; walk away, and an expensive bougie place called &quot;New Seasons Market&quot; 17 minutes away.) The QFC is kinda dinky. If I want more choice, the next nearest is Safeway, which is 40 minutes away by bus (an hour away by walking; 7 by car. I don&#39;t own a car). For lots of choice AND cheap groceries, I go to WinCo (45 / 50 minutes by bus)."

2022-06-15T04:51:29Z,2022-06-15T04:54:23Z,2,"I honestly don&#39;t know how I would eat if I didn&#39;t work at a grocery store. Being able to buy what I want to eat for lunch and then taking home the leftovers/buying something before leaving after a shift is the only way I can really get food as a person in the US without a driver&#39;s license. Maybe I&#39;ll live in Amsterdam one day...Also, the way people in the US treat wanting to live within walking distance of a grocery store is annoying. Whenever I&#39;ve said that&#39;s a requirement of my living location, people seem to imply that I&#39;m lazy and unable to plan/think ahead (&quot;What do you mean you don&#39;t know what you&#39;ll want for dinner in two Thursdays!?&quot;). It&#39;s exhausting."

2022-01-21T21:41:14Z,2022-01-21T21:41:14Z,0,"First thing I saw when I was in Amsterdam: the peace!  Seing a mum with her kids on a cargo bike parking literally 2m away from the store door,  getting  inn and finding no awfull &#39;OFFER&#39;,  2x1, or similar shit,  nothing. First thing I found near the entrance was chopped vegetables for soup,  ready to boil.  Soda drinks were anecdotic,  and most of garbage food wasn&#39;t there!"
2022-01-06T18:51:03Z,2022-01-06T18:51:03Z,0,"The presence of local and many grocery stores has been so obvious and woven into my life when I was in Mumbai, India.. that when I moved to the US for studies and work.. it was such a rude and stupid shock. I still find it upsetting that there isn&#39;t a decent corner shop where I live and I would still need to go to a grocery store by driving my car. Sure there&#39;s 2 convenience stores in walking distance, but what people forget to mention is that the absence of MRP (or MSRP) means small stores can charge whatever the f they want for items. How are you supposed to pay 35% more and still choose to not have a car? I think this is what is completely wrong in the US. once a rule of printed MRP on items is established, just seen how well local corner shops start doing then!"

2021-12-14T18:24:08Z,2021-12-14T18:33:35Z,0,"I&#39;m just now remembering this. I remember seeing a documentary years ago about New York City. I think it was during the 50s or so when an abnormally bad winter hit. Back then people had their bread and milk delivered to them but because no one could get around in the cold, the milk and bread was NOT delivered to those people. They also still had trains above ground at the time so the train tracks froze in some places. Does anything like that ever happen in Amsterdam? I mean, such bad winters people have a hard time even leaving their homes?Oh yeah, don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I was just thinking this kind of shopping seems a lot more sanitary than getting those groceries, bringing them back to the front, have a cashier touch them while scanning them, and risk a special needs bagger to bag everything again for you and possibly cough on you like they do at the store I work for in the US. I also just showed this video to my mom and she loves it. Unfortunately, I am a cashier so I would need to be trained in something like maintenance to work in a place like that, I think."

2021-10-22T18:19:12Z,2021-10-22T18:19:12Z,2,I lived 8 years in Amsterdam and so far 3 years in Canada. I think you&#39;re painting a false picture of living in the centre of Amsterdam with living in the suburbs of a Canadian city. When I used to live downtown Ottawa I easily made grocery store trips on foot. When I lived remote Netherlands I had no other option than to drive to a strore to buy things. I appreciate your channel but please stay realistic.
2021-10-21T22:57:29Z,2021-10-21T22:57:29Z,2,No it is because in Amsterdam you&#39;re always high when shopping

Cities are the worst things ever happened to humans.It&#39;s a jail. I grew up in one of the biggest cities in the world.... Lived in another big city, worked in a big city,...Once you buy a house nearby farmland you&#39;ll understand.Then all your dumbass friends who bought a &quot;60m¬≤ penthouse&quot; come and visit you and be like...

2021-10-19T14:48:06Z,2021-10-19T14:48:06Z,0,Most of the Netherlands is like this?  Or is this Amsterdam specific?  There are major metropolitan areas in the US that are like this.
2021-10-17T23:00:59Z,2022-01-13T14:11:20Z,5,"I remember shopping for groceries while in Amsterdam,  it was way easier and most stores had fresher/healthier options than the U.S."
2021-10-17T15:38:19Z,2021-10-17T15:38:19Z,0,"Walmart, target, Costco, sams club and bjs are not ‚Äúgrocery store‚Äù ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èand can count a lot of places in the USA that have small grocery stores, good public transportation with city convenience life style. We have everything here."
2021-10-15T02:16:50Z,2021-10-15T02:16:50Z,0,"I can spend, say 1hr grocery shopping in N. America. But let&#39;s say 2 because traffic is really bad. I lived in a place like Amsterdam where your apartment is so small there&#39;s no room for food, even the fridge is small, so I was constantly going shopping... 15min one day, 20min. the next, 30min on another, doing this 5 times or more a week really adds up. I&#39;d rather go once, get enough for two weeks, then it&#39;s done. Over.  I found it super annoying to have to continually go shopping."
2021-10-14T15:38:22Z,2021-10-14T15:38:22Z,6,"There&#39;s pros and cons. I can definitely see liking Amsterdams style of shopping but Sometimes people don&#39;t want shopping to be an experice. They need it to be practical and quick. Sometimes you need a variety of items and instead of hopping to multiple stores you want it in one place. Plus not everyone has time or wants to do constant trips. Even if it&#39;s once a week, the little extra time for multiple trips throughout the week would be equal to the car based trip. And honestly the time thing is an exgeration. Most people live in suburbs and grocery stories are less than 5 min drives and are often accessible by foot and bikes. Just not as elegantly as Netherlands obviously. I&#39;m not super familiar with Toronto, but in downtown Ottawa there&#39;s plenty of easily accessible markets where you don&#39;t need a car. But when it&#39;s freezing cold, and there&#39;s snow everywhere, you do wish you could just drive. What I&#39;ve started doing is that I just order groceries online and have them delivered. Saves way more time and for the typical packaged stuff, I don&#39;t need to look at the items. In between if I need something I&#39;ll ride my bike to grab smaller shorter lasting items. When in regards to buying bulk. The stuff you buy in bulk isn&#39;t really the contributing factor of food waste. It&#39;s a cultural thing where privelaged people toss away food for stupid reasons. Bulk buying makes sense for several people. Large families don&#39;t need to make constant trips for regularly bought long lasting items. If you want to be most cost and time effective, there&#39;s no doubt that it&#39;s far superior. Obviously that only works in certain situations and if youre a single in an apartment, buying in bulk doesn&#39;t make sense. However, luckily there are stores other than Costco where you don&#39;t have to buy stuff in bulk."
2021-10-09T12:41:09Z,2021-10-09T12:41:09Z,0,"Amsterdam‚Äôs population is not even a million people. It‚Äôs about 900,000 people. New York City is over 8 million people."
2021-10-06T13:15:05Z,2021-10-06T13:21:45Z,4,"Going to the store each and every day can also be an absolutely hassle, even if the store is close by. This is what I used to be doing for years and it sucks away a lot of needless time because each time you&#39;re essentially doing the same thing and yoiu have to walk from a to z in the store to pick up your products each day. You have to wait in line 7 times compared ot just one time. Also, while the shops are smaller in locations such as amsterdam, they also tend to be quite crowded . Especially in amsterdam stores are crammed into tiny locations with low ceilings where you can hardly pass other people who are also shopping there.  It&#39;s more effective to go do grocery shopping 1 or 2 days a week and plan ahead what you&#39;re going to buy because people will be mored tempted to buy unhealthy food when its after work and they are hungry (and this 7 times a week). While of course there is nothing wrong with a channel promoting their opinions , this channel almost promotes opinions as absolute facts b cherry picking arguments that support his opinion, yet does not mention the arguments that support the alternatives So for example when he mentions the issues with the typical suburbs, he forgets to mentions the positives (like los of healthy vegetation, neighboud house far away so they do not looks into house house, less issues with noise disturbance because your neighhours are not that close by etc etc)"

2021-09-22T17:07:48Z,2021-09-22T17:07:48Z,156,"I went to Amsterdam in 2018 while on deployment. It is now the gold standard for the city I want to live in. The culture, design, and efficiency present in that city were astounding! I love the bikes, and people there. I was dumbfounded how truly amazing it was seeing all of the bicycles and  walking. Just those 2 things paired with the ability to do them pleasantly, was a very refreshing experience in my life and inversely similar to the situation not just notjustbikes chose to become a city designer, where his hatred for Houston made him want to have things better, it was the sheer bliss that being in Amsterdam for those 4 days made me want to become a city designer aswell. I&#39;ve really been enjoying the content on this channel, and it has really shone some light on the issues with America. Consumerism has been engraved in the very roads we walk on here, you have to have a car. And all of the expenses that go along with one...."

2021-09-20T02:22:13Z,2021-09-20T02:22:30Z,69,"Amsterdam actually makes shopping for groceries so much more enjoyable. Anytime I gotta go shopping in the US, I gotta get in my car, drive through a few lights, fight for parking, try not to get hit by other drivers looking for parking, grab a cart, go around the entire store just go get whatever I need, wait even longer in the lines, try not to get hit by drivers looking for parking, and drive all the way back home."
2021-09-19T01:06:50Z,2021-09-19T01:06:50Z,0,"There are plenty of smaller super markets in the US.  I shop at my one every few days, just like you do in Amsterdam, sure I have to drive there but it&#39;s on the way home and a few blocks from my house so I walk in summer if I just want a lunch.  Oh yeah they sell lunches too, great salads and bread baked in store the works.   You don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to shop at big store if you don&#39;t want to.   Funny thing is too during the early pandemic when all the big stores had standard items missing from shelves our smaller supermarket, part of a small local chain, had plenty of stock as it used completely different supply chains and local suppliers."
2021-09-17T17:33:21Z,2021-09-17T17:33:21Z,0,"A couple of years ago, I started riding my bike to the grocery store a couple times a week, in contrast to the usual driving there a couple times a month.There were a lot of things that sucked about it. For one thing, despite being only a mile away, it was on the other side of a freeway, which meant I had to wait at two red lights (each lasting about 5 minutes, it seemed) within a couple hundred feet of each other. Along with the other assorted lights, the trip would take almost half an hour. Every time I crossed the street, I had to be aware of any drivers who were making turns and might not see me (and I had a few close calls). Plus, it was the middle of summer, and it was hot outside.Despite the added convenience of using a car (It takes less than ten minutes to drive there, especially since the freeway lights are designed to stay green long enough for a car to drive through them, just not a bike), I miss the experience. I only stopped in the first place because my bike got stolen, and then Covid hit before I got it replaced.In the first place, it was really an excuse to ride my bike, which is something I&#39;ve always enjoyed, especially vs driving a car. But honestly? The main attraction was the fact that I could just grab everything I needed for a couple of days, and not worry about making a list, checking it twice, and knowing that everything I forgot would be something I would have to go without for several weeks."

I&#39;m trying to think of what the differences are here ‚Äì definitely one of them is the equitable distribution of stores instead of creating food deserts in very rich or very poor communities (very rich got on the FreshDirect train early, very poor people are neglected).

There are 2 butchers, 2 bakeries, and 3 shops that sell premade Korean meals and side dishes. There&#39;s also a green grocer.  If you walk a full city block there&#39;s a traditional market with more fresh produce and fish. We go to the actual big super markets maybe once a month and Costco maybe every 2 months for special imported items, coffee, and good deals on meat and alcohol.I wonder if in the Netherlands they have clear pricing on labels like they do here. If you pick up a box of cereal and look at the price tag it will tell you the cost per 100 grams. This makes price comparison super easy and quick. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen that in the US."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, great video. üòÅBut as for the no parking this is mostly in large cities like Amsterdam and such. When you get deeper into the country with smaller cities or villages there are most of the time possebilities to park a car for those who do want to buy more in one go (parties, larger families sometimes).Little tip for foreigners. Don&#39;t buy food on airports or trainstations, it&#39;s greatly overpriced. Just walk outside and go to a bigger convience store and the price/quantity difference will be better. (example Eindhoven station AH to go is pricy, walk towards the city center and there will be a normal AH which is the same products but cheaper).Enjoy The Netherlands ü§ó"

I used to live in Houston - the grocery store was a 10 minute drive. I lived in Vancouver and Kingston, Ontario - same thing, 10 minute drive. I&#39;ve been to Amsterdam a dozen times and don&#39;t recall many grocery stores in central Amsterdam. There are, of course, Costco&#39;s on the edge of town in lots of North American cities, but there are plenty of large grocery stores 10 minutes away."

2021-06-19T01:01:50Z,2021-06-19T01:01:50Z,1,"What are the prices like though? In the US bulk grocery shopping is MUCH MUCH cheaper. I sure hope Amsterdam&#39;s small grocery store prices don&#39;t match the US&#39;s small grocery store prices, cause there&#39;s no way I could afford that!"
2021-06-18T00:08:31Z,2021-06-18T00:08:31Z,1,really this channel is just showing me that i want to move to amsterdam.
2021-06-14T23:07:26Z,2021-06-14T23:07:26Z,1,You make many false assumptions about grocery shopping in America. Most people do not shop at costco type store. And high density cities have many places to shop just like Amsterdam.  And personal preferences to shop twice a month and buy enogh to last is just fine. Different is not better.

2021-06-12T08:45:23Z,2021-06-12T08:45:23Z,0,"I can&#39;t believe that grocery shopping in the Netherlands is better than for example in America. There are indeed a lot of small supermarkets in cities. The dominant one is Albert Heijn. And whether you go to Amsterdam, to Groningen or anywhere else in The Netherlands, all the products at Albert Heijn are the same. regional products have been killed by them. Also, the quality of the AH products is very disappointing. Almost everything they sell is industrial, bad quality food, full of additions and preservatives. Because the supermarkets in The Netherlands are small and the products are everywhere the same, the variety of choice is very limited. O by the way, in all other brands supermarkets, the products are the same as in AH: industrial and with limited choise. I still can&#39;t believe that in a modern society as the Dutch is, the people still put up with this. I recommend you to go to France, Germany or even Belgium to see the big variety of choice in good quality products is there to be found. Oh, and I am Dutch and lived all my life in The Netherlands."
2021-06-11T02:30:31Z,2021-06-11T02:30:31Z,2,"Calm down with the complete and utter fallacy.  I live in a big city in America, my big grocery stores are 5-10 mins away.  I buy in bulk and don&#39;t pay the poor tax.  I buy fresh produce/meats weekly for whatever delicious meals we&#39;re making.  Are you referring to the suburbs or rural areas of America?  I mean yea go to Amsterdam and miss out on all the business you can do here in America but hey Amsterdam and no cars are really neat right? Or whatever you have to tell yourself to make yourself feel better."

2021-06-08T05:01:42Z,2021-06-08T05:01:42Z,5,I like to make my home a convenience store so I don&#39;t need to leave the house for days.
