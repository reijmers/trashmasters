Recyclables Abstract From a circular economy perspective the municipal waste MW sector remains a valuable inpu t source for waste recyclable reindustrialization am ong food pollution and energy In this study different accounting approaches and scenarios for s ustainable MW management are explored to find the most cost efficient and profitable approac h The Full Cost Accounting FCA method is adopted as the basis of analysis in this study wher e an integrated sustainable framework for the PayAsYouThrow PAYT pricing model is developed and designed that can optimize MW management in attaining zero waste disposal at th e lowest cost as well as generating economic environmental and social benefits Using waste mana gement data from councils in Egypt and two different PAYT methods ie weightbased and v olumebased under three case scenarios this study documents that the prepaid bag system un der the volumebased PAYT method leads to the lowest waste costs and creates more incentives for households in terms of economic social and environmental benefits These findings have var ious implications for the policy makers government councils waste managers businesses and communities in the adoption of volume based PAYT schemes for costeffective profitable a nd socially acceptable reusing and recycling of waste Such valuable addition to MW management c an contribute to the

approach under the Full Cost Accounting FCA called Pay AsYouThrow PAYT pricing model for municipal waste MW management in the Egyptian mun icipal councils to assess their dynamic cost efficiency in resource recovery from MW system s The circular economy concept presents the integration of economic activity and environmen tal wellbeing in a sustainable way and is gaining weight as an alternative to the make use dispose paradigm European Commission The recent Global Waste Management Outlook GWMO has estimated about billion tonnes of solid waste generation each year from urban households commerce industry and construction activities UNEP and ISWA w hich poses a severe threat to the environment and ecosystems The entrenched linear e conomic activities in depleting natural resources that began in the th century industrial revolution has ignored the longterm environmental damage causing high social and enviro nmental cost to the society The linear economy exclusively focuses on economic need with t he core principles of take make dispose over exploiting resources and technological innovat ions for economic growth Linear economy models involve extracting resources and using them to make products and then disposing them in landfill In contrast the concept of the circular economy replaces the dispose aspect with repair refurbish recycle by giving circular cri teria to the life cycle of the products It emerged as a paradigm shift with core principles take mak e reuse that respond to environmental and societal needs while using natural resources A cir cular economy values resources by keeping materials and products in use for as long as possib le Such a shift to a circular economy model requires ecoinnovations of resources to manifest t he needs of environmental resilience despite the tendency towards economic growth Scheel The circular economy allows the value of resources materials and products to remain on the marketplace for as long as possible minimizing waste and the use of resources Maximizing the use and value of resources brings major economi c benefits innovation and growth However safe disposal and recycling of materials often rema in challenging for various reasons such as poor management and enforcement regulatory disparities lack of infrastructure and high cost of waste recycle systems etc which can have environmental and associated public health impacts One of the key outputs of diverse industrial and social ac tivities is waste management from production activities and municipal sources Although manageme nt of municipal solid waste is a priority in Journal Preproof urban cities the methods used for collection and d isposal to date are far from perfect and cost effective meaning that solid waste is not disposed of properly Open dumping and burning methods are used excessively and heavily pollute th e environment endanger lives through the spread of highly infectious and deadly diseases cl og up sewerage systems and damage basic infrastructure In many countries including Egypt i n the Middle East and North Africa MENA region and except for the majority of OECD countri es the antiquated systems of collecting separating weighing or sampling of solid waste and disposal are irreparably damaging the environment Given that solid waste continues to be generated at an abnormal rate the challenges are twofold i the need for effective control an d disposal of waste for sustainable development and ii to have cost efficiency benefiting all sta keholders for appropriate waste management From the perspective of solid waste management the cost effectiveness of separated waste collection and proper management for identification and separation of municipal waste MW is a key approach to promote the responsible use of wast e as an economic resource According to the principles of a circular economy recycling implies additional costs for separated MW collection The segregation and separation of household waste a t source have been identified as key waste management methods to optimize MW management Malin auskaite et al While the circular economy is a comparatively new concept wit hin the sphere of sustainability championed by the Ellen McArthur Foundation starting in Ellen MacArthur Foundation the MW sector appears to be one of the core integrated par ts among food pollution and energy security that can threaten all sustainability efforts from a circular economy perspective Stankovska and Dimitrieska Tisserant et al argue t hat innovative waste treatment methods encompass the circular economy approach starting fr om waste generation until waste is reused andor recycled The circular economy concept is ba sed on take make and reuse see Egypt Business Directory for more details with its Rs principle of reduce or reduction reuse and recycling materials consisting of the characte ristics of low consumption low emission and high efficiency Wang et al Such a circula r economy framework clearly illustrates the strong links between the environment and the econom y and the minimization of the primary natural resource use Ghisellini et al It emphasizes a combined view of the three main aspects ie environment resources and economic be nefits Lieder and Rashid to achieve the ultimate goal of zero waste disposal via the reuse repair restoration and recycling of existing materials and products and ensures that re sources return to the value chain after use of a Journal Preproof product Reusing and recycling of waste can also si gnificantly contribute to environmental and social sustainability While resource recovery or saving from municipal wa ste systems does require the cost benefit analysis being economically feasible achie ving cost efficacy is the key to promoting the responsible use of MW management as an economic resource that benefits all stakeholders From management accounting perspectives cost effic iency is the priority in dealing with operational activities relating to MW for sustainab le development In other words the solutions of MW management should not only be environmentally sustainable but should also be cost effective profitable and socially acceptable Mali nauskaite et al However lack of accurate information on actual waste composition c ollected and treated is one of the main barriers to waste management planning Tisserant et al So the growing demand for information in business and society is driving acco unting to become progressively complicated and integrated with organizational economic and so cietal processes and activities The much more important development aspect is the interactio n between accounting including sustainability accounting and reporting Thomson and sustainabilityrelated issues such as food security pollution and energy security None theless little is understood concerning such interaction Contrafatto and Burns This is more challenging for an emerging economy like Egypt as compared to a developed economy The application of FCA under the umbrella of Environmental Accounting Management tools helps to integrate environmental and social sustainability matters into decisionmaking Nadeem et al contend that FCA can effectively measure both direct and indirect costs and benefits both internal and external of an organization that leads towards the transition to a circular economy While a number of FCA methods and tools have emerged over the last two de cades with different goals and scope of the assessment the FCA method of this study on MW in E gypt is more aligned with the United States Environmental Protection Agencys USEPA method for FCA that includes externalities in the costbenefit assessment These externalities are real costs to society but they are not reflected in the price of MW services Jasi nski et al In fact in the existing MW pricing system in Egypt the cost of external impac ts is borne by societyhouseholds and neither business nor households consider or pay the full co st of MW services Therefore the use of the advanced environmental co sting approach FCA and in particular the PAYT pricing model briefly described below allows shared responsibility and Journal Preproof benefit for municipal councils businesses andhouse holds for recyclable commodities In fact the application of waste management using PAYT sche mes reveals the effectiveness of PAYT schemes in both costs and waste reduction that woul d support the transition to the circular economy by providing a stable operating environment for all stakeholders consumers manufacturers councils and minimizing social and environmental costs to society In waste management systems the main purpose of PAYT strate gies is to support a more sustainable management of waste flows from an economic social and environmental point of view This is usually based on the waste hierarchy process to pro duce lower flows of waste first by both reducing polluted waste at source and reusing prod ucts and secondly by increasing recycling rates by avoiding landfill Such PAYT application g enerates economic benefits as well as environmental benefits in terms of both waste reduc tion and increased recycling rates Karagiannidis et al Lakhan European Commission Thus the main scientific research question is to investigate an integrated sustainable framework for a PAYT pricing model designed from an accounting perspecti ve and then to explore the possible implementation methods of a PAYT program Elia et a l in the Egyptian MW management service As a case study the research s pecifically bases on the FCA method where PAYT is modified and calculated for Egyptian munici pal councils for details see Figure and Equations PAYT has two streams relating to co sts and benefits of the scheme For waste disposal reuse and recycling purposes on the one hand the cost aspect follows the introduction of a mandatory charge through fixed costs FCF for construction and operational facilities and a variable cost VCF including direct DC and indir ect IC costs for the reduction of waste generation and increases in recycling rates On the other hand the benefit aspect flows from food saving value FSV consumed and reduced recyclable waste price RWP compost value COMV energy saving value ESV and savings from greenhouse gas emission GHG Considering both costs and benefits together the t otal waste charge under a PAYT scheme ie fee collection or pricing can be determined for ho useholds and businesses that eventually integrates with sustainable development from a circ ular economy viewpoint This is how the application of FCA PAYT scheme can support transi tion to the circular economy by combining both economic and environmental challenges and prov iding a stable operating environment The contribution of the present study firstly deriv es from the fact that the MW sector has a strong public benefit component to reach the best M W management that result in the lowest cost Journal Preproof with highest circular economy benefits food pollu tion and energy In Egypt the MW is not separated or sorted at source before collection bu t waste pickers remove recyclables at disposal sites prior to collection processes by municipaliti es The growing stream of MW in Egypt either solid or food wastes requires a sustainable waste management strategy Egypts Vision Website in addition to raising peoples and organizational awareness towards this problem Elmenofi et al To adopt separated waste c ollection schemes and for raising public awareness implementation of the PAYT accounting ap proach is essential There are three technical pillars to implementing the PAYT approach identifying the waste generator measuring the waste amount that needs treatment and unit pri cing per emptying household andor per kg or tonne Both councils and households would get direc t benefits of a costeffective MW management system Therefore this study contribute s to highlighting the best collection method that leads to the lowest cost and maximum benefit f or all interested parties in MW management systems in Egypt by considering direct and indirect benefits to achieve sustainability A second benefit is to support the design and the applicatio n of the effective PAYT accounting approach for pricing MW collection systems in Egypt by integrati ng economic environmental and social aspects which are still lacking in the literature a nd in real practice The proposed PAYT model aims to fill this gap by designing an integrated fr amework to support policy makers and waste managers in the adoption of PAYT schemes It can cr eate substantial economic social environmental benefits for industry energy food security especially if it is managed properly with reasonable implementation of an integrated sus tainable weightbased or volumebased PAYT costing approach Such an accounting approach is still lacking in the literature and real practice in Egypt Therefore it is expected that t he paper would contribute to the reevaluation of the current policy measures and the modification of the pricing policy design for municipalities The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section briefly highlights the existing Egyptian municipal waste management and st rategic vision for adopting the circular economy approach Section describes the methodology undertaken for an integrated sustainable framework for the PAYT accounting model for pricing MW collection systems Section extends the comparative analysis of the r esults and discussion with a suggested PAYT scenario implementation in Egypt two suggested PAY T methods ie weightbased pricing model and volumebased pricing model have been pro posed for implementation in Egypt Finally Section proceeds with conclusions of the study Journal Preproof Egyptian Municipal Waste Composition and Strategic Vision The incremental growth in population urbanization and income will double food demand over the next years On the other hand the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO estimates that food loss and waste FLW in the Ne ar East and North Africa NENA amounts to kgcapitayear valued at over USD billiony ear or USDcapita conservative estimate NENA natural resources lost due to FLW a mounts to km year of water food production and supply chains and million hay ear of land Mediterra b p In Egypt food losses of the available cereals between harvesting and final consumption range from to FAO Additionally of the loss of fresh vegetables occurs in Egypt at postharvest stage Mediterra b Therefore edible and nonedible food waste represents a considerable proportion of MW in Egypt as presente d in Table below Table illustrates the MW composition in Egypt compared with some develope d countries It is clear from Table that Egypts MW differs considerably from that in develo ped countries The reasons for this range from lack of awareness and poverty to affluence in Egypts urban population In addition much of the recyclables retrieved from MW occurs at vari ous stages Table MW Composition by Country percentage of w eight

Concurrently the percentage of MW regularly collected and managed in a suitable manner will increase from the current by collection efficiency to reach in by collection efficiency and then to in by

option Methodology for Integrated Sustainable Framework for PAYT Pricing Model using Full Cost Accounting Approach for MW Collection System As mentioned earlier achieving cost efficiency is the key to promoting the responsible use of waste as an economic resource that can benef it all stakeholders in any jurisdictions MW management needs to be environmentally sustainable as well as costeffective In this study different accounting approaches and case scenarios for sustainable MW management are explored to find the most cost efficient and profit able approach In doing so from the methodological perspective Egyptian waste manageme nt data has been collected firstly where the primary information is mostly from websites bo oks journals etc as well as a lot of facts and data from international and national reports Secon dly the FCA method is adopted as the basis of Journal Preproof analysis in this study where an integrated sustaina ble framework for the PAYT pricing model is developed and designed It is considered as the mos t effective collection system that has proven to give the highest yield to boost sorting technolo gy such as focusing on the products design stage Maurer and designing PayAsYouThrow schemes Elia et al Thirdly using the FCA method three case scenarios are anal yzed and compared based on the PAYT pricing model These scenarios are A PAYT is not implemented B PAYT is implemented but no waste reduction occurs and C PAYT is impl emented and waste reduction occurs It is noted that these case scenarios explicitly ex hibit the difference between the pricing model without PAYT case scenario A and pricing mo del with PAYT case scenarios B and C In the absence of a PAYT scheme the other pricing model is usually a household or commercial flat rate to be paid to the municipals for the wa ste management services These fees mainly depend on the commercial and noncommercial activit ies In addition there are fee charges to informal garbage collectors and disposal of househo ld or commercial waste while additional oneoff or recurring charges may also incur for lan dfill and burning facilities depending on the need of household or commercial firms In aggregate the flat rate pricing model case scenario A appears to be more expensive than the PAYT prici ng model case scenarios B and C for all stakeholders as evidenced in the case analyses for scenarios A B and C in subsection below In fact the former pricing model does not c apture the impacts associated with environmental and social externalities Further it is highlighted here that in this study the case scenario B refers to traditional PAYT pricing mode l that extends to case scenario C as modified PAYT pricing model by integrating some d irect and indirect aspects of the economic environmental and social benefits Although Figure below demonstrates the traditional PAYT pricing model under the FCA method this study exte nds it to Figure below incorporating environmental and social impacts resource recovery or saving which is known as the integrated sustainable framework for the PAYT pricing model T he environmental and social impactsbenefits range between direct to indirect ones derived from a modified PAYT pricing model On one hand the direct social benefits could be related to food saving health job creation and the recycle waste market On the other hand the indirect envir onmental benefits are linked to improved air quality greenhouse gas emission and energy saving value The integrated sustainable framework for the PAYT pricing model is reflected i n the case scenario C documenting solid advantages over case scenario A and to some extent over case scenario B As such the Journal Preproof methodology is described below stating the applicat ion of the traditional PAYT pricing model with relevant figures and mathematical equations an d then extends to the integrated sustainable framework for the PAYT pricing model Accordingly the three case scenarios are analysed and interpreted to identify the best costeffective and resource recovery or saving scenario that supports sustainable development towards a circular economy Application of PAYT pricing model The main steps to follow in a PAYT system are the i dentification and measurement of waste under the unit pricing model as presented in Figure below Alternative PAYT methods have also been investigated in the literature howe ver the single user service door to door collection is more common for household MW collect ion services Elia et al According to the classification proposed by the US EPA US Environmental Protection Agency the costs include a Upfront costs which include the initial investment to purchase a nd establish the essential equipment and technology to collect waste such as vehicles As well it may cover the cost of public awareness information campaigns abo ut the new and updated MW service b Operating costs which include all costs that may vary with the was te collected transported and final disposal Also it covers wor kforce fuel and purchase costs for garbage bags in addition to managing waste collection acti vities on a daily basis Figure Main steps in a PAYT system Unit Pricing Model User Identification Waste Measurement Fee Collection Fixed contribution fixed costs Mixed contribution fixed and variable costs Single user service door to door collection Multiple user service street side collection Volumebased Weightbased Source Modified from Elia et al Journal Preproof Adopting PAYT charging models which are defined as unit or variable rate pricing models when applied in MW management systems requi res evaluation for new organizational issues which increases the waste management service complexity level compared to the adoption of flat charging models Elia et al Under PAYT models each citizen must pay for the overall service cost based on their actual quantity of waste they throw away The most popular accounting system for MW management that applied PA YT strategies is the FCA method Weng and Fujiwara Karagiannidis et al DO nza et al Weng and Fujiwara evaluated the MW management system effective ness in Taiwan using an integrated cost benefit analysis with more focus on financial cost effectiveness of MW systems On the other hand Karagiannidis et al adopted the full cost accounting method to estimate the waste management cost and household waste charges in Gree ce using different polluterpays scenarios and DOnza et al proposed a meth odology for calculating the full collection costs from various waste types As this studys analysis focuses exclusively on the waste collection process measuring the full cost of collection activities requires est imating the direct and indirect variable costs where the fixed costs are charged as a fee on elect ricity use in Egypt The estimated direct costs include the garbage bags labour vehicles and fuel that are used or involved in the MW collection activities Currently two main approaches are used to define t he fee pricingcharging model The first approach is to calculate the fee based on a s ingle contribution that differs according to the level of service consumption while the second appro ach is based on a mixed model where both fixed and variable contributions exist Thus follo wing the basic charging model of Elia et al a Municipal Waste Collection Fee MWCF is charged to the i th user where i is the governoratecouncil which is based on two main comp onents defined in Eq MWCF FCF VCF FCA generally refers to the process of collecting and presenting information for each available alte rnative in order to conclude to a decision and may be considered in terms of environmental economic and social impact s FCA aims at recognizing quantifying and allocating the cost related to a process or a product by counting w here appropriate also the environmental and social cost Karagiann idis et al p Journal Preproof Where FCF i is the fixed costs of the MW management service wh ich covers the basic fee and VCF i is the variable costs which covers the i th user fee contribution FCF i which is generally estimated based on different parameters r ather than depending on the collected waste from a user For example it may depend on net inco me of citizens total number of residents in a house or the commercialnoncommercial activities of users etc In this paper FCF i is based on the estimated investment cost for the proposed program by the Central Department of Waste Management of th e Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency EEAA in to improve the MW system Again VCF i is estimated based on the actual quantity of collected waste from the user which is defined in Eq VCF Q DC IC DC IC Where Q NR and Q j are respectively the quantity in tonnes from non recyclable organicfood and recyclable waste flow collected from the i user ie the governoratecouncil DC and IC are the unitary costs for direct and indi rect costs including garbage bags collecting transporting maintenance and tipping for final tre atment andor disposal The inclusion of direct and indirect environmental and social costsbenefits in the MW charging fee has been suggested by prior studies to give a more comprehensive view for the local governments about the integrated performance level of the MW management processes for more reading see Weng and Fujiwara To do so the PAYT pricing model in Figure uses the FCA method By applying FCA it is possible to expa nd traditional PAYT models to involve direct and indirect environmental and social benefi ts which are considered as cost reduction or savings due to the impact of MW collection service s on other industrial activities and resources such as food security environmental pollution and energy security Accordingly Figure below presents the proposed integrated sustainable framew ork for the PAYT pricing model design using the FCA approach The proposed program covers the investment costs r elated to improving the MW systems administrative and setup costs direct and indirect fixed costs It includes removal of accumulated solid waste prevent furthe r accumulations by improving the efficiency of collection and trans port establish mobile and stationary transfer stat ions control dumpsites and improving its efficiency establish c entres for waste recycling and

comparative analysis of the results the inv estment cost fixed cost is the same in all PAYT cases whether waste reduction has occurred or not By contrast for all implementation scenarios the operational cost will be potentially reduced by the monetary savings earned directly due to revenues from marketing recyclables Case scenario A PAYT is not implemented Under the current MW collection and disposal system in Egypt residents indirectly pay a flat fee for the waste management service via the ir electricity bill in addition to informal charges The fee mainly depends on the household ac tivities whichare either commercial or non commercial The fee ranges from LEmonth USD per household to LEmonth USD for shops and commercial activities Unde r this case scenario all household wastes are not separated or sorted before collection and n o additional investment cost for the PAYT Journal Preproof program will be considered The results indicate th at the total MW cost management under case scenario A without considering any revenues earned from marketing recyclables is USD million from which million is for organic food waste nonrecyclables Total recycled wastes are approximately USD million while the rest are USD million land filled for Egyptian municipal councils The tota l flat fee revenue charged based on the number of households million in is around USD millionyr LE million in for Egyptian councils This indicates the severe gap USD between cost USD million and collected fees USD million unde r case scenario A where PAYT is not implemented That is MW collection costs in Egy ptian councils are much higher than collected fees under the no PAYT program Case scenario B PAYT is implemented but no was te reduction occurs By adopting a PAYT program residents directly pay for the services of waste collection based on the amount of wastes they throw away The amount of waste is measured by two PAYT accounting methods such as weightbased and volume based Table below presents the findings of these two PAYT accounting methods When PAYT is implemented even without any waste reduction occurring case scenario B the pr ices for recyclables covers both variable and fixed collection costs leading to cost savings per tonne which indicates a profit for the governoratecouncil Where a negative sign value oc curs it means an extra cost per tonne should be incurred by the governorate or per household to cover the total MW management cost Additional environmental and economic values from c omposting and energy generation are a bonus as shown in Table below although extra cos ts have to be added to mitigate or reduce the GHG emissions during composting and recycling activ ities and until final treatment or disposal After considering indirect environmental and econom ic values generated from MW collection with source waste separation by households the ove rall value for the total cost per tonne or per household is profitable under both PAYT accounting methods More specifically full costs per tonne under the w eightbased scheme are USD while under the volumebased scheme they are USD It is notable that the net yield for recyclables under the volumebased scheme is better compared with the weightbased scheme probably because the weightbased scheme is more la bour intensive By implementing a volume based scheme each MW could generate USD profit per tonne above the full MW Journal Preproof management costs and USD benefit generat ed per household compared with only USD profit per tonne and USD benefit generated per household by the weightbased scheme respectively Again both profit per tonne for governoratecouncil and benefit per household from composting energy and G HG emission values are higher under the volumebased scheme USD and USD respec tively than the weightbased scheme USD and USD respectively Table Profit full cost and interrelated effect per MW tonne collected under PAYT accounting methods

tonne under case scenario C is slightly increased compared with case scenario B S imilarly while the values of recyclables are much higher in case scenario C than case scenario B the reverse is evident for the environmental and social value These are because transportation and maintenance costs are affected by collection frequency daily as well as by the qua ntity of waste collected The results from this study shown in Table reveal significant differences in the means of MW collection cost per tonne in favour of the vo lumebase method tvalue with p value and tvalue with pvalue versus

in Tabl e which is similar to Table However notably unlike Table in Table the average vari able cost per household under case scenario C is much lower as compared with case scenario B Sim ilarly as per Table the recyclables value and environmental and social value per household ar e much lower in case scenario C than case scenario B These findings clearly document the sui tability of the

for MW services will b e based on volumebased or weightbased of the waste collected Both weightbased and volum ebased methods are very different in design and equipment requirements In a volumebased progr am residents are charged for waste collection based on the number of bags or cans they use indicating size of waste containers On the other hand in a weightbased program waste is weighed at the curb where collection crews measure the amount of waste residents set out for c ollection and they are billed for collection and disposal accordingly Although most countries use v olumebased systems which are significantly less expensive to set up operate and manage than w eightbased systems to administer the MW service as part of their transition to the circular economy Egypt neither adopts the circular Weightbasemethod Volumebasemethod Case scenario A Case scenario B average cost Case scenario B average difference Case scenario C average cost Case scenario C average difference Case scenario B Case scenario C Case scenario A Weight base Full cost Volumebase Full cost Recyclables value Enviro social value Journal Preproof economy approach nor the volumebased or weightbas ed system in MW collection programs The current method of waste management in council i n Egypt is a flat rate on collection and disposal of waste for all residents irrespective of the volume or weight of waste as described in Section under case scenario A is not implemente d Unlike the PAYT volumebased or weightbased system this flat rate system is much more costly without having any sustainable benefits in terms of social and environmental aspec ts in order to support the transition towards the circular economy Therefore in this paper Egy pt has been taken as a case study where the application of an effective PAYT accounting approac h for pricing MW collection systems has not yet been developed Building on prior literature and practical experien ce gained from other countries the integrated PAYT model proposed in this study under a volumebased system aims to achieve cost efficiency and financial benefits for both mun icipal councils and households Therefore in this study council waste management costs benef its and the resulting municipal charges are considered by using FCA for the two different PAYT methods ie weightbased and volume based under three case scenarios for implementatio n The integrated PAYT framework is to support policy makers and waste managers in the ado ption of PAYT schemes Based on the experiences documented in other countries both a f ixed and a variable fee in Egyptian municipal councils are adopted in this study rather than a f lat rate only depending on the amount of waste generated This is because on the one hand waste collection fees charged should reflect the cost structure of waste disposal which includes both fix ed and variable costs while on the other hand levying fees on collected waste quantities may only increase illegal disposal activity Therefore the fixed fee inclusion in the service fee will hel p to mitigate such practices Furthermore in order to incentivize more collection of separated w aste at source fees on the collection of residual organic food waste could be used to fund s ource separation activities Therefore fees are set only on residual organic food waste and providi ng the service of collection for recyclables without charges or they may go further by buying s eparated recyclables from the user Comparative analysis in this study identifies the d ifferences in unit costs of the waste collection and the best method in financial terms f or both households and the municipal councils The results reveal that both PAYT methods ie wei ghtbased and volumebased will reduce the cost incurred by the councils and for households i f anticipated waste reduction occurs ie case scenario C The variable cost collection transpo rtation and final disposal costs for the volume Journal Preproof based method garbage bagsbased will be decreased by an average of per tonne in all cases compared with weightbased methods which is s lightly increased by per tonne This is because weightbased methods require more labour to do the weighing process However the variable costs per household under both case scenar io B and case scenario C PAYT based are lower than case scenario A without PAYT If a fam ily is willing to achieve waste reduction under case scenario C the percentage of variable cost reduction for the household will be higher for the volumebased method against th e weightbased method Therefore the volumebased bag method creates more incentives for households because it has the lower variable charge USDbagyear case scenario B volumebased and after reduction efforts the variable waste charges may decrease by USD bagyear case scenario C volume based The prepaid garbage bag scheme leads to th e lowest waste charges for both case scenario B and case scenario C Thus the highly su ggested method to be implemented in Egypt is based on a prepaid garbage bag system under the volumebased modified PAYT method under case scenario C This can generate a coste ffective scheme The weightbased method is less applied in practice as it is more labour inte nsive and complicated to design and manage Again there are incentives for the municipal counc ils to implement PAYT for environmental social sustainability and economic savings from recyclables However successful implementation of PAYT needs to establis h a continuous promotional campaign taking effective actions versus illegal diversions while creating adequate and enduring incentives for households which is essential It is noted that generally the total amount of recyclables and the quality of supplied secondary materials are aff ected by the level of source separation for MW For example recovering recyclables from mixed waste tends to reduce its marketing possibilities because of its possible contamination Conversely separate collection of separated MW from households at source can lead to increases in the costs of the waste collection process On the other hand as illustrated in Figure below source separation for MW results in profitability for both councils and households Fur ther it creates significant economic environmental and social benefits for industry ene rgy and food security if it is managed properly with reasonable implementation of the integrated su stainable PAYT cost accounting approach It is suggested that for evaluating the impact a revi ew must be conducted after an adequate implementation period for the charging method in te rms of economic environmental and social performances For economic performance it is impor tant to ensure that the full cost of the Journal Preproof overall MW management service including the value o f recyclables is covered While environmental performance could be evaluated for e xample by the reduction in GHG rates due to incremental flows of recycled waste the assessm ent of social benefits could be made by reductions or exemptions for low income citizens Thus this study has a strong public benefit compon ent to reach the best MW management that result in the lowest cost with the highest circular economy benefits in an emerging economy context There are increasing dema nds from councils communities and businesses to adopt low cost MW management systems that extend sustainable benefits ie environmental social and economic to all stakehol ders and the society While developed countries are at the forefront in this space emerg ing and developing countries are still catching up This study sheds some light on an emerging mark ets MW recyclable management cost accounting approach ie FCA based modified PAYT p ricing model for achieving cost efficiency and contributing to broader environmenta l climate and social issues These findings have various implications for the policy makers go vernment councils waste managers businesses and communities in the adoption of PAYT schemes for costeffective profitable and socially acceptable reusing and recycling of waste that can contribute to environmental and social sustainability These outcomes can be genera lised to other emerging economies for achieving their sustainable development and cost ef ficiency However this study is not free from limitations F irst and foremost the data sample municipal councils might not be considered large e nough for the crosssection study Also a circular economy takes all sectors and industries i nto account though only a few industries are selected in Egypt as the core of circular economy Second a country specific context may be an issue eg Egypt in MENA Each country either deve loped or emerging has its distinct institutional and sociocultural settings For exam ple the findings or experience in one country may not be exactly the same as in other countries o r regions Third in terms of the methods applied the study is a scenariobased case study o n two alternative PAYT pricing models from a circular economy context These limitations of the current study can be overcome by future research It is expected that future research may u ndertake further indepth analysis on a larger sample size industry sectors and data periods Fut ure research studies should consider capturing other emerging countries for a comparative analysis among emerging economies by controlling their institutional regulatory and socioeconomic features Future research potential also lies in Journal Preproof the application of other empirical and qualitative methods to review a comprehensive circular economy approach This approach fosters innovation and new business models for economic social and environmental benefits It is important to explore a better understanding of the sustainability and circular economy relationship in a greater depth from the viewpoint of municipal waste management and the impact on busine sses customers and society as a whole Journal Preproof Figure illustration of how the described model h as been applied
