End users or consumers are the starting point where e-  waste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy , such as repair, reuse, remanu - facturing, and recycling. E-waste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of e-waste with household  waste by consumers. Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to  achieve CE. Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers ’ e-waste-related  knowledge and awareness, and behavior on consumption, disposal, storage, recycling, and repair. Substantial  knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around e-waste may be integrated into  the CE model. This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing 109 research papers published in international  peer-reviewed journals identified in the Web of Science  core collection database, using content analysis  methodology to analyze and review the articles. The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a  more consumer-centric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and  implementation strategies around e-waste. This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer  behavior around e-waste. The study results show that consumers ’ disposal and recycling behaviors are the two  main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed. In contrast, reuse and repair behavior were investigated  to a lesser extent. In this study, several research gaps and areas for future research are identified, along with  suggestions for a CE framework focusing on the e-waste sector that, encompasses policy initiatives and business  model innovations. The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are  starting to work on consumer behavior-related e-waste research.    1.Introduction  The rapid technological revolution, coupled with increasing demand  among consumers for high-tech products, has triggered unprecedented  levels of electrical and electronic equipment  consumption. At this  moment, there are approximately 900 different types of EEE found in the  international market . Electronic waste  or  Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  that EEE becomes at  the end of its useful life poses a severe challenge to the environment as well as to human health due to the presence of highly toxic substances  . E-waste management  is one of the most  pressing problems for today ’s modern society ,  with around 53.6 million tons of e-waste generated worldwide in 2019  and levels escalating rapidly .  Aside from reducing negative impacts, improved management of e-  waste streams represents a lucrative opportunity due to the various  precious and rare earth elements it contains . The  starting point for e-waste is consumers, who determine its destination.  *Corresponding author.  **Corresponding author.

Parajuly et al.  identified that the consumer is one of the  critical elements of the e-waste problem, with demand growth for EEE,  consumers ’ environmental awareness, and behavior being key factors.  From the CE perspective, four different paths are associated with con- sumers, which are  maintained/prolonged use, including sharing and  repair;  reuse and distribution;  remanufacture/refurbishment;  and  recycling .  CE is “an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by  intention and design ” . Reverse  supply chain , product/service design, business models, EoL re- covery, product/service use, and policy are the CE’s building blocks  . According to Lieder and Rashid   , "the definition is more comprehensive as it considers both the  environmental and economic advantages simultaneously under the  notion of regenerative performance ” requiring novel business models  that enable the high-quality circulation of technical material or nutrients  and safe entry of bio-nutrients or regenerated materials into the bio- logical sphere. Consumers, government, policymakers, charities, private  sector investors, digital disruptors (at a multinational or entrepreneurial  level), product manufacturers, parts manufacturers, service providers,  and stakeholders of recycling industries are the main actors in CE (Ellen  MacArthur Foundation, 2015 ). Fig. 2 shows related factors (central  inner circle) of a complex socio-economic system, and the building  blocks of a CE. According to Alamerew and Brissaud  , the blocks  and factors interact in a relatively complicated manner, requiring an  interdisciplinary approach to solve problems. In this case, information  on legal, economic, social, business, and environmental aspects are  particularly critical .  In 1990, e-waste was first considered as a priority waste stream in  Europe, and in 2002, the European Union  WEEE Directive was  published . Parajuly and Wenzel  argued that the  e-waste stream possesses a high possibility for reuse and valuable ma- terial recovery. The Directive imposes strict obligations on producers  regarding waste management under the Extended Producer Re- sponsibility  system . More recently, the EU CE action plan works towards "closing the loop" of product lifecycles  through sustainable production and consumption and sound waste  management . Due to the diverse range of EEE products, the  EU categorized e-waste items into six different segments. Table 1 shows  the categories, sample products, and legislative provisions of recovery,  reuse, and recycling for the member states.  In recent times, research related to consumers ’ awareness of e-waste,  consumption, storage, disposal, and recycling behavior has been gaining  Fig. 1.E-waste, consumers and CE model, adapted from MacArthur  and Parajuly et al.  .

Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 3attention among researchers worldwide. Broadly, consumer behavior  focusing on e-waste can be categorized into several areas: consumption,  storage, repair and reuse , disposal, and recycling (Bovea, M.D.  et al., 2018 ). Knowledge and awareness about the formal collection  system among consumers are also critical aspects that determine the  sustainability of the system in the socio-economic sphere. Several  studies, such as the study by Islam et al.  , Ramzan et al.  ,  Saphores et al.  and others, emphasized the issue. E-waste-related  policy, management system architecture, country-specific consumer  culture and behavior, and availability of a diverse range of product  categories in the market and their interaction with consumers create a  complex phenomenon defining and connecting building blocks and  definitions of circular economy with a sustainable e-waste management  system. Literature related to the consumer behaviors around e-waste is  proliferating; however, no comprehensive review article is found that  analyzed all the behaviors to spot the future research directions and  developing a consumer-centric circular economy framework focusing on  e-waste. This paper tries to eliminate such gaps by reviewing 109 articles  published between 2005 and March 2021 using content analysis meth - odology. The main research questions  of the article are:  RQ 1: How do the issues related to consumer awareness and  behavior with a particular focus on the e-waste sector contribute to the  essential operational framework in achieving a CE?  RQ 2: How can the general understanding contribute to informing  policymakers and researchers in identifying future policy measures to be  taken and the necessity of performing research studies in the area?  After reviewing articles published on consumer behavior around e-  waste in Section 4, a consumer-centric CE framework is proposed with  policy implications and business model innovation under Section 5.  With this, RQ 1 was answered. Based on the in-depth literature review of  the selected articles, research gaps were identified, proposing critical  future research directions in Section 5.3, by which RQ 2 was addressed.  The research contributions of this review article are:  it provided a  guide or reference for future researchers to accumulate all the infor- mation and knowledge surrounding consumer behavior-related topics  focusing on e-waste;  it attempted to propose measures achieving a  circular economy more holistically, from a framework perspective  focusing on sustainable consumer behavior and e-waste. In many cases,  published papers did not consider the CE concept into their central  research theme, focusing instead on various behavioral aspects. The  framework incorporated behavior-specific aspects into CE pathways,  creating interdisciplinary research opportunities in the field;  besides,  presenting, a quantitative assessment of the research progress in the  field, the article provided a transparent and replicable methodology,  which could also be utilized collecting materials from other available  databases;  in this paper issues related to policy and business model innovation are discussed, respectively, which provide suggestions for  both researchers and policymakers in system-level development and  future research areas; and  on the research topic, potential future  research directions have been identified, which could be useful for  future researchers.  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 dis- cusses some earlier review articles. Section 3 describes the research  methodology. An in-depth analysis of the literature is presented in  Section 4. Results and discussion are illustrated in Section 5. Finally,  Section 6 ends with the conclusion.  2.Literature review  To clarify the need of this review article, some of the previously  published review articles worth mentioning. Table 2 provides details of  the previous articles on the topic which also helped to perform a  structured literature review based on the content analysis methodology.  Details of the methodology is described in Section 3.  Based on Table 2, it is evident that in recent time, no comprehensive  literature review article has been published on all the consumers ’  behavioral aspects focusing on e-waste. Scopes of the articles also  showed that consideration of various product types was not given in the  previous review articles, and issues were discussed more in the local  context. Thus, a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding a  holistic picture of consumers ’ behavior around e-waste. This is the first  attempt at reviewing consumer awareness, and behavior focused on e-  waste, considering all the behavioral aspects to the best of the authors ’  knowledge.  3.Research methodology  According to Easterby-Smith et al.  and Brocke et al.  , a  literature review plays a critical role in understanding and exploring a  specific research field ’s structure. New theory development and inves - tigation scope could further progress the knowledge base by identifying  a useful literature review . In this study, the  four-steps systematic literature review technique proposed by Mayring   under the qualitative content analysis method is utilized. Fig. 3  shows the four steps process model for the content analysis method  consisting of material collection, descriptive analysis, category selec- tion, and material evaluation. Mayring  provided an extensive  discussion on the method. Previously, several literature review articles  have applied the research methodology to e-waste research (e.g., Wati  and Koo  ; Islam and Huda  ; Islam and Huda  ;  Ismail and Hanafiah  ; Ismail and Hanafiah  ; P˘erez-Belis  et al.  ).

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 43.1. Material collection  To collect relevant articles that focused only on consumer behavior  around e-waste, an extensive search was performed in the Web of Sci- ence  core collection database using “Advanced Search ” window.  The following keywords were used, which were previously utilized by  Islam and Huda  : “TS (“waste electrical and electronic equip - ment*") OR TS  OR TS  OR TS  OR  TS  OR TS  OR TS   OR TS  OR TS (“obsolete  electronics*") OR TS  OR TS   OR TS  OR TS  OR TS   OR TS  OR TS (“wastes elec- trical") OR TS  OR TS  OR TS   OR TS  OR TS   OR TS ”.  Here, TS refers to a topic utilized in the database. With these key- words, 4660 articles were found. In this stage, only "articles" (as a  document category) and published in the "English" language were  considered. Later, "public" OR "consumer*" OR "consumers*" OR  "customer*" OR "household*" OR "resident*" OR "residents*" keywords  were input in the refine search box of the database that retrieved a total  of 907 articles. As the studies need to have a primary survey component  as part of the methodology, the keyword "survey" was used in the refined  search, which delivered 152 articles. The search was performed on 13  November 2020. Other criteria for selecting the articles were that the  methodology section of the article must specify the sample size, sam- pling technique, and the number of the valid samples (of the  participants).  In some cases, a few studies identified through the search involved surveyed stakeholders other than consumers, such as repair technicians,  in the study by Sabbaghi et al.  . These were excluded from the  selection, as the group does not represent consumers. Finally, 109 arti- cles were found that focused only on consumers ’ behavior around  e-waste. The articles collected in the material-collection stage showed  that authors had analyzed more than one issue in most cases. For  example, P˘erez-Belis et al.  investigated the second-hand pur- chase and repair behavior of consumers focusing on small IT equipment  in which they investigated consumption, R&R and disposal behavior  altogether. Table 3 shows the article selection process for this review  article.  3.2. Descriptive analysis  The following subsections illustrate the analysis result on distribu - tion of the articles in various journal outlets, annual production of ar- ticles, subject categories of the articles, country-wise distribution of the  articles, electronic products focused on the papers, utilization of specific  research methodology/techniques in the articles and finally, data  collection and analysis techniques implemented in the collection of  articles.  3.2.1. Journal-wise distribution  The selected articles were published in thirty-six different journal  outlets. From Fig. 4, it is evident that most of the papers were published  in renowned journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production , Waste  Management , Resources Conservation, and Recycling and Sustainability .  The diversity of the journal outlets publishing papers on consumer  behavior related to e-waste shows the necessity of a multidisciplinary  approach to analyzing specific behavior-related problems and solutions.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 53.2.2. Year-wise frequency of publications  Annual distribution of the articles published on the consumer  behavior related issues focusing on e-waste from 2005 to 2020 (until 13  November) is shown in Fig. 5. Most of the papers are published in recent  years . 40 papers out of 106 papers were published before  2016, while 70 papers from 2017 or later. The highest number of papers  were published in 2019. It is expected that the trend will continue (due  to the increasing interest in the topic), and more papers will be pub- lished in the future. One article had a publication year of 2021, as some  journals publish online version first and volume and issue numbers are  assigned in advance.  3.2.3. Distribution of research papers by subject/discipline  Using the Web of Science  ’s “Results analysis tools, ” it was  found that 39% of the articles fell under the subject category of envi- ronmental sciences, which was the most prominent subject category  . Other categories included engineering  ,  green sustainable science technology , environmental studies  , regional urban planning , and business . These results  indicate that consumer behavior related to e-waste studies covers a  diverse spectrum of discipline areas that demand an interdisciplinary study approach.  3.2.4. Country-wise article production  Fig. 7 shows the geographical distribution of the studies, in terms of  the number of publications focusing on a specific country. In the  collection of the articles, first author ’s affiliation and country were  considered as the origin of the article. China, under the group of  developing countries, produced the highest number of articles (26 pa- pers until November 2020), and this number is higher than the number  of papers published by some of the countries from developed nations  such as the USA  and Spain . Malaysia ,  India , and Brazil  were some of the other devel - oping countries in which consumers ’ behavior was studied. Even though  e-waste is a global environmental problem and consumer behavior is an  important factor for e-waste impacts, surprisingly, consumer behavior  was studied in relatively few countries. For instance, from Australia,  there are only two academic papers published on the issue in 2020.  3.2.5. Product diversity in papers  As consumer behavior varies substantially according to the cate- gories of the products and specific product use, Fig. 7 shows the di- versity of the products discussed in the selected articles. MPs   were the most widely discussed topic in the consumer behavior related  e-waste research , followed by DCs   and liquid crystalline displays  .

Fig. 8 shows the distribution of the articles as per product cate- gories presented in Table 1. SITTE  products were most frequently  considered, followed by SE .  3.2.6. Distribution of research papers by methodology  In terms of research methodology , the most frequent meth - odology was statistical , followed by theoretical , analytical  , survey , and case study . The categorization made in  this study is based on the types and characteristics of the tools and  techniques applied to explain consumer behavior towards e-waste.  When studies performed or applied specific statistical methods, tools,  and techniques, those studies were considered under the category of  "statistical". Specific methods and techniques categorized as statistical  methodologies include Confirmatory Factor Analysis , analysis of  variance , Conjoint analysis, Correlation analysis, contingent  ranking  analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, Correspondence  analysis, various regression models such as logistic regression, Multi - nomial logistic regression , ordered logit regression model,  extended ordered probit model, Poisson regression model (count  model), generalized logistics regression, and hierarchical regression  . Various tests such as the  Chi-square test of independence, t-test, Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests,  Kruskall-Wallis tests, Mann-Whitney test, the Wald-Wolfowitz test were  also performed for the statistical analysis.  Methodologies categorized as “theoretical ” included those where,  authors utilized various theoretical approaches to analyze problems  and/or to incorporate theories into real-world scenarios. The most  common approaches classed as theoretical were, Technology Accep - tance Model , Fuzzy theory, Psychological needs theory ,  Norm-activation model  theory, Value-Belief-Norm  theory, and Goal-framing theory. Methodologies classed as “analytical ”  included Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations , Competing  risks survival analysis  model, Principal Component Analysis  , Probabilistic approach, MICMAC (Matriced ’ Impacts Croise ’s  Multiplication Appliqu ˘ee a UN Classement).  While all the papers selected for this review article involved survey  to some extent, studies were classified within the “survey ” category if  they were performed using any market research methodology such as  the Contingent Valuation Method , a survey-based economic  technique that was implemented mainly for assessing consumers ’ will- ingness to pay. This “survey ” category was created to separate these  research methodologies from others that were more statistical, theo- retical, analytical, or case study focused. Approaches that fall under the  “case study ” category include quasi-ethnographic approaches, direct  waste analysis, and word of mouth research methodologies. When cross-  cultural and cross-country studies were performed, then those were  considered as case studies.  Theory of Planned Behavior  is one of the dominant theories  used in the analysis technique coupled with structural equation  modeling . SEM is a combined statistical technique consisting of  multiple regression, path analysis, and factor analysis. Ajzen  first  postulated the TPB, and later several extended versions of the theory  have been implemented in marketing research. This evolved out of the  "Theory of Reasoned Action," which states that intentions are the best  predictors of behaviors. The central premise of TPB is that something is  more likely to be done if there is a plan to do it. According to TPB, in- tentions are the product of three different processes,  behavioral at- titudes,  subjective norms, and  perceived behavioral control.  Papers that applied TPB, particularly in e-waste-related consumer  behavior research, are presented in the Appendix in Table A2, and the  primary constructs and their interrelations are shown in Fig. A1.  Overall, it was identified that a diverse range of tools, methods, and  techniques have been applied, which indicates that these methods could  be part of the “tools and techniques ” specific factor explaining the cir- cular economy principles, at least in relation to consumer behaviors and  perspectives on e-waste. These results also showed that an interdisci - plinary approach is required for proposing new solutions and/or theory  development in the research areas.  3.2.7. Primary data collection and analysis techniques  As mentioned earlier, in the selection criteria of the papers to be  included in this article, a study must contain a survey component in its  research methodology. After analyzing the data collection technique   of the papers , it is found that face-to-face interviews   were implemented by 24% of the articles, followed by paper-  based surveys   and online surveys . Approximately  13% of the articles mentioned that a survey was performed; but did not  explicitly mention any specific DCTs. In some cases, multiple DCTs were  also observed; for instance, around 6% of the articles used both PBSs and  FTFIs.  3.3. Category selection  The main categorization of the content of this article and the  research framework is presented in Fig. 11. As mentioned in the material  collection section, the literature is classified into six major research  types/categories. These six categories are  knowledge, awareness,  and familiarity about formal e-waste collection and recycling systems;   consumption behavior ;  storage behavior ;  R&R  behavior;  disposal behavior ; and  recycling behavior .  The distribution of the research articles for six different categories is  shown in Fig. 12, with details of individual papers in Table S1 .  Disposal behavior was most commonly-assessed (26% of the publica - tions), followed by consumption behavior  and knowledge and  awareness . In contrast, recycling, storage, and repair/reuse  behavior were less commonly studied, which illustrates the need for  Fig. 6.Distribution of research papers by subject categories.

Material evaluation  Using inductive and deductive approaches simultaneously, two re- searchers performed a validity test as the last part of the content analysis  process. The reliability of the content was measured by both intra-rater  reliability and inter-rater reliability. After the material collection, all  necessary data have been extracted as per categories and subcategories  identified by the researchers and input in a Microsoft Excel ™ spread - sheet to avoid repetition error. In the WoS database, the same keywords  were utilized to search articles, producing similar results with the cor- rect articles. This is how reliability was established. Over time, a few  articles were added to the database. NVivo version 12 plus was utilized  in some places, identifying specific content and subsequent analysis and  for cross-referencing purposes. This is how the validity of the content has  been achieved. 4.In-depth analysis of the literature  In this section, multiple topics have been analyzed based on the  collection of the articles. In section 4.1, articles that discussed con- sumers ’ perceptions and understanding regarding e-waste and e-waste  collection and recycling system were analyzed. In Section 4.2, various  consumer behaviors were comprehensively analyzed. For example, in  Section 4.2.1 , consumption behavior related studies were highlighted,  while Section 4.2.3 and Section 4.2.4 disposal and repair and reuse-  related behavioral issues were compiled, respectively. Section 4.2.5  was dedicated to analyzing consumers ’ recycling behavior-related  studies. The overall mapping of the sections and subsections of the  analysis is shown in Fig. 13.  4.1. Consumers ’ knowledge and awareness regarding e-waste and  familiarity of collection and recycling system  Response from the consumers regarding "what e-waste is" and "the  negative health impact of e-waste" fell under the category of "general  awareness," and these specific questions were investigated by around  Fig. 8.Major e-waste considered in the papers  product  and  category according to EU WEEE Directive .  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 819% of the articles. Rather than developed countries, this issue was  mainly highlighted in the articles published from the developing coun- tries. Associated issues that come under the category of consumers ’  knowledge and awareness are analyzed in the subsequent subsections.  4.1.1. Understanding and perceptions of e-waste  Generally, mature adult consumers consider e-waste to create  negative environmental impacts . Similar result was  identified by Siringo et al.  and Tan et al.  . Even young  consumers in Australia had the same perception .  Same phenomenon was identified for the Chinese young people in the  study of Ramzan et al.  . However, Borthakur and Govind   mentioned that level of awareness related to potential harmful impact of  e-waste on environment was found substantially low. Similar result was  shown research conducted by Awasthi and Li  , Ravindra and Mor   and Saritha et al.  . On the other hand, sometimes people  do not consider e-waste as dangerous and toxic (Pandebesie et al.,  2019 ).  Lack of information related to e-waste was found to be one of the  critical aspects that need to be disseminated , as often  e-waste recycling-related activities and consumers ’ role is unclear . This scenario  prevails both in developing and developed countries, for example, by  Saphores et al.  in the USA, where the authors found that con- sumers were unwilling to transfer the waste to proper recycling facil- ities. Limited e-waste toxicity knowledge often creates barriers adopting  environment-friendly products. Darby and Obara  mentioned that  consumers demanded more information on where they can recycle their  small WEEE instead why they should recycle. In an e-waste take-back  system, lack of awareness, insufficient information, and  socio-demographic factors  significantly affect con- sumers ’ motivation to return e-waste .  There are also other behavioral factors associated with the motiva - tion to adopt environment-friendly practices, and Siringo et al.   found that moral norms, environmental beliefs, and social pressure  significantly affect performing  appropriate  activities, such as recycling. Liu et al.  even urged for a funda - mental change in the environmental awareness and behavior. Environ - mental beliefs largely influence willingness to pay  to develop a  sustainable EM system, even if recycling convenience is limited (Nixon  et al., 2009 ). Nguyen et al.  mentioned that end-user ’s willingness  to participate in recycling programs, laws and regulations, inconve - nience of recycling, and experience were four key factors that indicated  WTP for e-waste recycling. Adequate environmental knowledge could  lead to stronger environmental belief, and Saphores et al.  found  that environmental knowledge was a significant predictor of WTP for  environmentally friendly products. Several authors suggested that con- sumers ’ awareness-raising programs should be organized (Saritha et al.,  2015 ).  4.1.2. Lack of e-waste-related awareness – the consequences  Due to lack of knowledge, informal sector collectors and recyclers  got an advantage and became more influential. For example, Islam et al.   found that 30% of the households preferred to sell their e-waste  items to local scrap collectors or even throwing e-waste with household  waste. Pasiecznik et al.  ’s study indicated that 12% of respondents   did so as well. For a formal system (devel - oped and prepared as per environmental guidelines), ‘weak environ - mental protection awareness ’ and limited knowledge of recycling  channels results in a low collection rate, which is a loss in investment.  Low-level of awareness could also influence personal beliefs. For  example, Fraige et al.  found that 11% of consumers believed that  they could dispose of WEEE with household waste. Product-specific  waste collection, for instance, in the case of waste mobile phone   recycling, low awareness levels, and inadequate recycling abil- ities were considered as main obstacles .  Furthermore, hibernating behavior  could evolve  due to little e-waste knowledge. Storing e-waste at home is a general  practice which is nothing but stockpiling material resources in the whole  supply chain or the built environment .  Bai et al.  particularly mentioned that perception regarding  resource conservation effort  needs to  be more understood by the consumers.  4.1.3. Familiarity of collection and recycling programs  The familiarity of the formal collection and recycling system   is critical for a system ’s overall long-term sustainability. Often such  awareness, especially location of the nearest e-waste collection points,  was found limited . Similar result was found research  by Borthakur and Govind  , Gu et al.  and Ravindra and Mor   . Despite the presence of some level of e-waste-related knowledge  among consumers, sometimes, the awareness of the existence of any  e-waste recovery programs in a region or city was found limited. For  example, Awasthi and Li  found the issue for case of Bangalore,  India; Deng et al.  for Hong Kong, China; and Islam et al.   for Sydney, Australia. Environmental consciousness among young uni- versity students is expected to be higher than the general population, as  Fig. 9.Distribution of research methodologies of the selected articles.   Fig. 10.Data collection techniques of the articles.  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 9seen by Dhingra and Maheshwari  and Ramzan et al.  , and  Islam et al.  . Publicizing information regarding formal C&RSs  was found to be critical in several studies . Similar  conclusion was found for South Korea by Park et al.  , China by Yin  et al.  and Finland by Yla-Mella et al.  . On the other hand,  Wang et al.  disagreed with such argument for the residents of  Shandong Province, China. Due to the lack of appropriate information  regarding collection points, Colesca et al.  found that 43.48% of  the respondents dispose of their e-waste via other pathways such as  landfills. Information dissemination on the collection schedule was also  critical . Miner et al.  mentioned that  community-based interventions to improve awareness levels have  significance.  Dagili ßutle et al.  mentioned that despite self-reported aware - ness, consumers were not familiar with the various classifications of  e-waste  under the national EM of Lithuania. Among  the various categories of e-waste, SE has a relatively shorter lifespan,  and Echegaray  found that the products ’ expected lifespan decreases with the electronic device ’s portability. Cao et al.   concluded that most consumers could not differentiate between formal  and informal sector e-waste collection channels. Chi et al.   mentioned that despite the higher economic benefits of old-for-new   collection schemes, 60.7% of respondents in their survey did  not know about the price differences with other collection channels.  Martinho et al.  mentioned that environmental consciousness  existed among Portuguese consumers, however, due to a lack of  knowledge about recycling campaigns/programs, such moderately  familiar aspects failed to capitalize on the higher collection and recy- cling rate of waste tablets and MPs.  4.1.4. Impact of socio-economic factors on consumers ’ e-waste knowledge  and awareness  In India, Singh et al.  found that respondents with higher  educational qualifications had higher awareness about e-waste. Similar  results were also found by Shaikh et al.  in Pakistan. Nowakowski   identified the factor as influential in Poland. Islam et al.   found that age, household size, and income were significantly associated  with recycling program familiarity, while Milovantseva and Saphores   found gender and age. Regional distribution of EEE use and  gender are vital attributes to a successful e-waste management system  . Bhatt et al.  found that most women from Delhi and  NOIDA were more cognizant of the environmental issues related to  e-waste. Miner et al.  mentioned that respondents ’  socio-demographic characteristics had no significant influence on the  levels of awareness, knowledge, and willingness to participate in the EM  programs and extended producer responsibility schemes.  4.1.5. Awareness improvement techniques  Arain et al.  suggested that e-waste educational campaigns  should inform consumers on what constitutes e-waste and why it is  essential to ensure proper recycling. Saphores et al.  mentioned  that providing education to young people and making e-waste sites  convenient (similar to the curbside collection program for other recy- clable products) for older people were crucial aspects of participants ’  willingness to recycle. Song et al.  mentioned that despite general  Fig. 11.Categorization and research framework of the studies.   Fig. 12.Distribution of research articles for different categories.  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 10hazard perceptions among consumers regarding e-waste, educational  campaigns should be promulgated specifically for reuse and recycling.  Environmental protection and resource conservation-related education  should be given at an early stage, creating recycling habits.  Jafari et al.  contend that the focus of awareness-raising  campaigns should be on college students, higher-income households,  and married residents. Young consumers in a developing country, such  as China, believe that EM is a shared responsibility of different stake - holders, including consumers, the government, manufacturers, and  sellers . Huang et al.  also found that re- spondents are willing to share environmental responsibilities around  e-waste in China and similar perceptions exist amongst Australian  consumers . Kumar  mentioned an opportu - nity to influence and propagate pro-environment behavior amongst  young adults through university programs. Table S2 presented in the SI  shows various solution techniques proposed by the reviewed articles ’  authors improving consumer awareness.  4.2. Consumer behaviors  Various consumers ’ behaviors were analyzed in the selected articles.  The articles were categorized into five different consumer behavior  types, as shown in Fig. 11 (consumption, storage, disposal, repair/reuse  and recycling), which are discussed in the following sub-sections.  4.2.1. Analyzing consumers ’ consumption behavior  “Consumption behavior ” was one of the significant topical issues  researched by over 20% of the selected articles. Measurements applied  to understand behavior included the number of appliances in house - holds, average ownership of household appliances, average lifespan of  EEE, reasons for replacing EEE and, frequency of replacement. Factors  affecting consumption behavior are discussed below, including growing  device penetration rate, source of device acquisition, factors-related to purchase decision, device-specific product ownership, reasons and trend  of device replacement, and product lifespan. A detailed summary table  of the consumers ’ consumption-related studies is presented in Table S3  in the article ’s SI. In the last column of the table , articles were  mapped according to their discussion area.  4.2.1.1. Growth of device penetration rate – the reasons. The consump - tion of AC is influenced by climatic conditions to a greater degree than  other products such as PCs , TV sets, re- frigerators, and WMs . Similar result was found by  Chung et al.  for Hong Kong and by Song et al.  for Macau.  During the Christmas season, consumption of electrical and electronic  toys increases . On the other hand, new  government initiatives in ICT knowledge and skill dissemination pro- gram showed a positive trend in higher device usage (Rodrigues et al.,  2020 ). Rodrigues et al.  also identified that the government  incentive program accelerated computers and printers ’ penetration rate  in Brazil. The major contributing factors to high penetration and  replacement rates were “the rapid economic growth of a country ” (Bhatt  et al., 2017 ), “the income of growing consumer segments, and the  competitive market for electronic products ” ,  “affordable fast-pace technological innovation and price ” (Arain et al.,  2020 ), “local manufacturing base ” , “ever-increasing  consumer demand ” , and “poor electronic repairability  coupled with shorter product lifespan ” . High-tech  device penetration, such as PCs, now becomes an indicator of a city’s  economic and cultural development . Among large  equipment, the most consumed products are washing machines, air  conditioners and refrigerators . Chi et al.   mentioned that, except for mobile phones, per capita consumption for  large equipment was higher than small equipment such as camcorders  and printers. On the other hand, a high device replacement rate in- dicates consumption patterns and future EG .  Fig. 13.Sections and subsections of in-depth literature review.  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 114.2.1.2. Factors-related to purchase decision. Consumers prefer to buy  cheap  electronics, despite a shorter lifespan (Othman et al.,  2015 ). “Comparative price ”  and “warranty period,  brands, and installment facilities ”  were also found as  critical criteria during product purchase. Recommendations from  friends and, store promotion were some of the motivating factors behind  purchasing decisions . On the other hand, Huang  et al.  found that "launching of new products with more powerful  designs and extended capacity" and "the increasing purchasing power"  were the main reasons for new product purchase.  Some studies introduced a hypothetical green product to assess  consumers ’ WTP or willingness to buy . For example, both  Nnorom et al.  populated the concept of “green phones ” that do  not contain any hazardous substances, and can be disposed of with  regular household solid waste. Similar research was conducted by  Milovantseva  in the USA. The products ’ purchase and use in- tentions were found to be positive, despite discrepancies about extra  money . The primary enablers for green product  purchase and WTP for such products were “environmental attitude   ” , “resource (money  or wealth) ” , “ease of use” ,  and “product eco-labeling ” . Milovantseva   found that consumers who had a positive attitude towards  recycling small electronics had significant environmental beliefs.  Importance of environmental product labeling was critical especially,  for informed decision-making of the consumers .  Tu et al.  found that brand recognition, service quality, usage  period, and perceived prices are the most significant characteristics of  “iPhone ” as a MP brand. For purchase motivation, “recognition ” and  “brand advantage ” were the factors. In contrast, “recognition, ” “brand  advantage, ” and “service quality ” were essential factors for brand loy- alty, and “perceived price ” was necessary for purchase intention. Au- thors also found that female respondents were more inclined towards  “recognition, ” “brand advantage, ” and “perceived price ” than their male  counterparts. Simultaneously, the level of income was the critical  socio-economic variable for the factor “perceived price. ” The factor also  influenced the consumers ’ purchase intention. Bai et al.  reported  that consumers tended to purchase mobile phones more frequently, and  the service life of mobile phones was decreasing dramatically, with  phones most commonly purchased brand new through official channels.  Echegaray  and Li et al.  showed variable ownership  levels for different appliances, with MPs having the highest per-capita  consumption and, DCs the lowest, for Brazil and China, respectively.  Similarly, Araujo et al.  observed that mobile phone ownership  was higher than other LE such as WMs, ACs, and SE such as tablets and  DCs. In India, Borthakur and Govind  that the number of the  out-of-use mobile phone was equal to or higher than the number of  in-use mobile phones. Bai et al.  identified that more than two  MPs were possessed by the majority of the consumers in China. Martinho  et al.  identified that smartphone usage is higher than tablets in  Portugal. Consumers with high income and education tended to acquire  more high-tech equipment, such as MPs, plasma TV sets, PCs, and ACs  . Similar trend was observed by Song et al.  for  China as well, and for Vietnam by Nguyen et al.  .  4.2.1.3. General product-focused trend. Rodrigues et al.  found  that the device acquisition  period was higher for white  goods but smaller for SE and screen categories. Zhang, L. et al.   mentioned that product functionality is shifting towards more portable  devices (e.g., DCs’ functions could be replaced by tablets and laptops  and digital cameras by mobile phone). A stationary device such as a PC  requires fewer updates among the students. Borthakur and Govind   identified that between computers and MPs, the latter is replaced  more frequently than the first one among the Indian consumers. For  example, within 2–3 years, MPs were replaced, and for computers, it was every 3–4 years. Beyond four years, none of the devices were used.  4.2.1.4. Reasons for device replacement. The reasons for product  replacement could be broadly categorized as malfunction, technological  obsolesce, and, demand for additional features (Sabbaghi and Behdad,  2018 ). Consumers ’ perceived obsolescence is characterized by physical  and technological obsolescence. The first two reasons were more evident  in European developed countries, and the last one is seen from the  developing country ’s context. Furthermore, due to demand for addi- tional features, the product itself became obsolete and in that case,  replacing a new item was the only option that consumers had. Wieser  and Troger  revealed that perceived obsolescence is the primary  motivation for mobile phone replacements and the defective device was  the main reason for replacement. Perceived obsoleteness was the main  reason for replacement rather than “desire for a new phone ”. Logics of  technological change and fashion were the determinants of replacement.  Articles discussing for product replacement identified multiple rea- sons, which varied between products. The fast advancement of tech- nology, function, and application availability was critical for MPs (Bai  et al., 2018 ). Among the various reasons, “broken down ”/- malfunctioning device/damaged ” was found as the main reason for  device replacement regardless of the product types. Such trend was  observed among consumers from different parts of the world. For  example, in India by Borthakur and Singh  ; in Australia by Islam  et al.  and Islam et al.  ; in Portugal by Martinho et al.   ; in Nigeria by Miner et al.  ; in UK by Ongondo and Wil- liams  ; in Spain by P˘erez-Belis et al.  ; in Brazil by Rodrigues  et al.  ; in Pakistan by Shaikh et al.  ; finally, in China by Tan  et al.  and Yin et al.  . Pandebesie et al.  discovered  that the unstable electrical voltage was the main reason for products  malfunctioning in Indonesia. It is a common phenomenon in developing  countries.  Among the other  reasons, “lack of accessories of SE”  , “upgrade from network operator ” (Martinho  et al., 2017 ), “longer battery life” , “fashionable,  music storage, picture storage for MPs” ,  “new system requirements by software applications for DCs” (Islam  et al., 2016 ), “old design  ” (Afroz  et al., 2012 ) and “backdated functionalities ” ,  “stolen ” , “lost” , “completely  destroyed ” , “service lifetime exceeded ” (Tan et al.,  2018 ), “market introduction of newer designs ” ,  “influences by others  ”   were found critical among consumes. Distribution of  the reasons for replacement is shown in Fig. 14.  In some studies, “fashion pursuit ” , and “additional  and more advance technological features ”  were  selected as the main reason for device replacement. Borthakur and Singh   found that consumers tended to buy new phones even though  their old phone is still working. For mobile phones, “fashion (Yin et al.,  2014 ) and “ status ”  were found as the two  critical driving force of the new product consumption behavior. Similar  behavior was observed for other small equipment such as for “MP3/MP4  players ”  and for “notebooks ” .  Such high device replacement rates can indicate future EG (Arain et al.,  2020 ). On the other hand, Shaikh et al.  mentioned that con- sumers from Pakistan tended to buy new EEE due to their needs, not for  luxury, regardless of the new product introduction in the market.  4.2.1.5. Factors affecting device replacement. Ongondo and Williams   found that among the various parts of a mobile phone, replacing  batteries was the most frequent activity among students for which the  device was replaced. New device purchases do not necessarily depend  on products being malfunctioned; instead, consumers demand improved  quality or capacity. Echegaray  identified that “technical failure ” M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 12serves as a proxy indicator for product obsolescence, and this is observed  as a tangible reality for all individuals. Milovantseva and Saphores   found that getting a more recent model is their primary moti- vation for replacement in the case of MPs. Replaced phones were still in  working condition and hold economic value.  Nowakowski  mentioned that the time to replace LE is higher  than SE. Jayaraman et al.  found that computer literacy had a  significant moderation effect on laptop usage. If a user has a relatively  high knowledge of using laptops, then there is a high probability that  device replacement would occur after active use.  4.2.1.6. Perspectives of young consumers. Ongondo and Williams   identified that young consumers ’ age was not associated with the fre- quency of mobile phone replacing and the number of phones stockpiled  by students. Islam et al.  found that the "number of items in use"  laptops, television sets, and DCs were significantly associated with age,  income, and household size of young consumers in Australia. Around  28% of the students changed their MPs every year. Besides device fail- ure, mobile phone replacement because of the upgrades from network  operators was dominant, and this should be considered the planned  obsolescence. The young consumers ’ lifestyle was found responsible for  the shorter lifespan of MPs . Although  limited, a small proportion of the students changed their MPs due to  fashion pursuit. Wieser and Troger  found that the definition of  "up-to-datedness" of a mobile phone varied. For example, old re- spondents perceived that their MPs were not technologically or  aesthetically obsolete, opposite to the young.  4.2.1.7. Product-lifespan. Product lifespan-related articles are summa - rized in Table 4.  Overall, product lifespan is a critical parameter that is generally used  to estimate EG. Furthermore, for a similar product, the reported value of  product lifespan may provide a tentative international comparison for  future studies and define that product ’s lifespan profile. Table 5 shows  the lifespan of various e-waste items.  4.2.2. Analyzing consumers ’ storage behavior  After useful life of an EEE, consumers tend to store the equipment at  households before it reaches to collection points or the household bin,  especially for small WEEE items such as MPs. Although this issue is  crucial and considered a significant barrier for potential acquisition for  collection and recycling , very few studies focused  on this specific topic . The number of items  stored at households, storage time before disposal, and reason for storage were critical aspects that were used by the articles identifying  consumers ’ storage behavior. Summary of the storage behavior related  studies is presented in Table S4 in SI of this article.  4.2.2.1. General trend of device storage. In Switzerland, Thi˘ebaud et al.   found similar storage behavior for almost all types of electronic  products. The study also found that a vast amount of the products was  stored and reused before reaching the collection scheme. In Lithuania,  Dagili ßutle et al.  found that approximately 31% of respondents  stored obsolete EEE, which later transferred to the collection points. In  Poland, Nowakowski  found that computer accessories and other  information technology equipment were frequently stored by house - holds . For MPs, this was found above  80%. Another study by Nowakowski  identified that SE stored per  household was 1.5, while medium-sized equipment was stored one item  per two households. In Ireland, Casey et al.  identified that small  e-waste items are generally existing in less visible and more fluid states  due to the understanding of "lying somewhere in the house" on shelves  and in drawers, which resulted in addressing e-waste differently than  other recyclable materials. Ongondo and Williams  observed that  there is at least one mobile phone stockpiled for every student working  out the average in the UK. Martinho et al.  addressed that  smartphones have a higher reuse potential than tablets in the overall  storage behavioral pattern of Portuguese consumers.  In China, Zhang, L. et al.  found that students ’ storage  behavior was predominant . Tan et al.   found that 62.1% of residents stored their MPs among the participants,  while only 4.7% disposed of their WMPs in the formal collection facil- ities. Bai et al.  estimated that WMP stored at home was 1.79 per  person, and over the years, and surprisingly, it was observed that con- sumers became conservative in giving out their used phones to the  recycling channels.  In Brazil, Rodrigues et al.  found that more than half of the  respondents intended to maintain out-of-use EEE, where small EEE  products were stored the most compared to large EEE, as limited space is  required.  4.2.2.2. Dominant stored products. The top hibernated products were  “MPs” , and “laptops ” , followed  by DC , “mobile chargers ” ,  “computer mouse ” , “hairdryers ” (Pandebesie et al.,  2019 ), “digital cameras ” , “refrigerators ”  , “DVD players ” , “CRT TV sets”  . Regarding MPs storage, similar trend was shown by  Pandebesie et al.  in Indonesia; Ramzan et al.  in China,  and Shaikh et al.  in Pakistan. Singh et al.  found that both  “MPs” and “laptops ” were the top hibernated products in India. Now- akowski  found that both MPs and their chargers were the main  stored items in Poland. On the other hand, in Brazil, “mobile chargers ”  and “digital cameras ” were widely stored electronic product (Rodrigues  et al., 2020 ).  4.2.2.3. Motivating factors behind storage behavior. Top cited reasons for  storing old devices found in the studies are shown in Table 6. These  include barriers to recycling, such as cost and inconvenience, as well as  the benefits of keeping devices, such as spare parts, data retention or to  give to other people.  Martinho et al.  found that most respondents prefer to keep  e-waste items  at home instead of recycling.  Optimistic consumers ’ attitudes were identified for reusing the products.  Islam et al.  concluded that the lack of familiarity with a recy- cling program is critical for the observed WMP storage behavior. Wieser  and Troger  concluded that emotional attachment to the phones  due to data and information and the phones ’ qualities made consumers  not dispose of it in any other means. Besides, consumers thought their  Fig. 14.Top reasons for device replacement.  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 13kept phone would be used by someone instead of deliberately delivering  it to the recycling channel. In this process, reusing the phone with a  regular interval was common. In a cross-cultural study, Miliute-Plepiene  et al.  found that social norms are the most crucial factor in  storing e-waste in Lithuania ’s early-stage recycling system; this did not  apply to the case of Sweden.  Information/data security was the principal reason for storing MPs.  Blake et al.  mentioned that consumers tended to keep their de- vice as a spare/backup, as it may have a monetary value. Similar reason  was identified by Shaikh et al.  . Bovea, M.D. et al.  iden- tified that e-book readers, GPS navigators, or radio alarm clocks were  stored because they could be used in the future as spare parts. Singh  et al.  identified that consumers often do not have or do not know  about the dumping or resale opportunities of the discarded EEEs, which  triggered storage habits. Qu et al.  mentioned that little knowl - edge on hazard and contamination of e-waste coupled with preserving  memories motivated device hibernation behavior.  4.2.2.4. Mitigating measures against storage. Rodrigues et al.   found that storage behavior could be changed by implementing recy- cling policies, reverse logistic systems, environmental education, and  incentives for social participation. Casey et al.  reported that charity campaigns and life transition circumstances (such as moving and  renovation) could be internal and external triggers, respectively, against  hibernating behavior.  Ongondo and Williams  found that take-back services could  encourage students not to hoard more than one extra phone, but some  students may not participate even with knowledge of such schemes.  Greater a awareness of the “environmental value ” (the importance of  recycling to reclaim the resources embedded) within the phone could  increase participation. Arain et al.  concluded that consumers ’  awareness of stewardship responsibilities and lowering the personal cost  to recycle could be determining factors behind reducing storage habits.  Zhang, L. et al.  contend that university students stockpile large  and increasing amount of personal electronics, unless economic in- centives are given. Pierron et al.  found that in a student ac- commodation setting, students were not interested storing as 1) there is  limited space and 2) alternatives   are now more readily available than previously. This finding is different  from others, where, in most cases, consumers wanted to store their de- vices at home.  Nowakowski  concluded that for developing countries, storing  and later reusing is expected behavior. The situation becomes intensified  when the purchase price of the product is significantly higher, such as Table 4  Summary of product lifespan-related articles.   Discussion focus Reference Summary  MPs Abbondanza and Souza   ≡MPs are the fastest growing e-waste items than CRT monitors, refrigerators and  freezers, and CRT TVs  Cai et al.   ≡On average, consumers use MP for 6 h per day  Borthakur and Singh   ≡Although the potential life span of a mobile phone is around ten years, the present-day  scenario is such that people will not use their phone longer.  Bhatt et al.   ≡Consumers in different parts of India is also changing their MPs in 1–2 years.  Thi˘ebaud et al.   ≡MPs’ service life is often connected to mobile phone contracts. Consumers ’ expected  service life for MPs was four years, while, MPs became obsolete   after three years.  Liu et al.   ≡The lifespan of MPs was considerably shorter than the technical life expectancy and  reduced from 3 years to 1 year   Cai et al.   ≡MPs’ service life is longer than the average life that included storage time  Jayaraman et al.   ≡Modular repair work, for example, a broken screen of a mobile phone, could extend  the product lifespan.  Ongondo and Williams   ≡Network operators ’ motivations and management strategies were identified as one of  the undiscovered investigations, with operator promoting a culture of quick new  technology obsolescence and product upgrades, with this seen as necessary for  network providers to retain consumers  Comparison between small  and LE Botelho et al.  , Cao et al.  , Chi et al.  ,   Echegaray and Hansstein  , Ravindra and Mor    ≡Small IT equipment such as MPs, digital camcorders has a shorter lifespan (consumers  changed every 2–3 years) than screens and LE such as TV sets, WM, and refrigerators  Nowakowski   ≡The average lifespan for refrigerators was higher than for TV sets and WMs.  Islam et al.   ≡Frequent repairing for refrigerators and TV sets was an economic burden for  consumers, but essential to reach consumers ’ expected product lifespan rather than  extend product lifespan    ≡most EEE used by the households were phased out within the product lifespan, and  devices were updated within two-thirds of the products ’ designed lifespan. TV sets  and computers were notable.    ≡the average lifespan of devices was three years, and old portable electronic devices  have been replaced three times within the device ownership period  Factors associated with  product lifespan Zhang, L. et al.   ≡The product lifespan of SE is shorter among university students than the general  population  Shaikh et al.   ≡Lifespan of flat panel television, routers and modems, laptops, notebooks, and tablets  were higher among women.  Echegaray   ≡Individuals ’ past experiences with products   should relate to the informed decision making of consumers ’ expectations and specific  product durability  Pandebesie et al.   ≡EEE’s lifespan depends on the quality of the goods rather than the availability and  quality of electricity.  Product lifespan – an  indicator for future  planning Abbondanza and Souza   ≡Efficiency and efficacy of a take-back system largely depend on local data on product  lifespan, required for future policy planning, especially location and capacity of WEEE  dismantling units and WEEE collection routing.  Chung et al.   ≡Regional data on product lifespan data is incredibly useful, and lifespan-related data  collection methods should be more efficient and accurate  Gok et al.   ≡Service life of product is inversely proportional to the quantity of EG  Yin et al.   ≡Product service life is directly associated with energy and resource use  M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 14smartphones. This overall scenario influences consumers ’ discarding  decisions. Improvement of WEEE returns ’ convenient methods is a  crucial factor enhancing the collection rate  of stockpiled  e-waste. Dagili ßutle et al.  found that consumers tended to repair  their MPs if they were malfunctioning and if the operation is economi - cally feasible; otherwise, the phones were stored or to a limited extent  threw with household municipal waste.  4.2.2.5. Storage period. Milovantseva and Saphores  found that  storing waste TV sets for up to 5 years was evident in American  households where the number of sets was one or more. Kurisu et al.   determined that PCs were disposed of within one year of storage.  However, 3.8% of PCs were hibernated for more than ten years. Islam  et al.  found that the average storage time  for  MPs is similar for Swiss and Australian consumers. Results on hiber - nating time showed that all types of personal electronics have been  retained for less than 3 years, with the longest retaining time close to 3  years  .  4.2.2.6. Socio economic factors. Milovantseva and Saphores   found that pro-environmental behavior in the past 12 months, age, ed- ucation, household size, marital status, the gender of the head of  household, type of dwelling, and geographic location was strongly  associated with the junk TVs storage among American households. The  authors also identified that larger households are more likely to have  more junk TVs, while the converse was true when household income  increases. Furthermore, the consumers ’ geographical locations impacted waste TV storage behavior, and in that case, the age of the sets was equal  or greater than 16 years old. Dagili ßutle et al.  indicated that age  has a positive association with storage. For example, due to limited  purchase power, students tended to use the products as spares. Another  study by Saphores et al.  identified that except for knowledge of  e-waste and income, all other explanatory variables age, marital and  employment status, ethnicity, household size, previous e-waste recy- cling behavior, and to some extent education, homeownership, and  understanding the consequences of recycling were found significant  indicators describing the households ’ e-waste storage behavior.  Pandebesie et al.  found that storage behavior is affected by  the consumers ’ residential conditions. Arain et al.  mentioned  that attaining a certain level of education alone is not sufficient to  eliminate storage behavior and lack of knowledge among consumers  regarding disposal options, such as the location of proper facilities and  concerns regarding personal data security, the main reasons for storage.  Qu et al.  reported that 80% of all residents had more than one  WMP stored at home, while 17% of them had more than four WMPs. One  of the apparent reasons behind this was high disposable income. Mar- tinho et al.  found that consumers with large household sizes and  high education levels were keener keeping broken smartphones in the  home .  4.2.2.7. Measurement perspective. Rodrigues et al.  found that at  the center of the EG estimation method, the portion related to storage or  donation could often result in overestimations (due to incorrect idea of  immediate substitution of product). Repressed demand is expected to Table 5  Reported product lifespans  of various EEE .  Ref.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 15implement reverse logistics systems, which is often hampered by the  storage habit. Singh et al.  mentioned that the storage of dis- carded EEEs is a problem in quantification and recycling. Casey et al.   found that keeping household items can be divided into two main  categories: 1) disused or broken and 2) abandoned. In both cases, over  time, the value of stored items dissipates, which is often more trouble - some than recycling or discarding it.  4.2.3. Analyzing consumers ’ disposal behavior  When consumers finally decide to dispose of unwanted EEE, many  options are generally available to them. It could be formal disposal paths  arranged and managed by government authorities or informal collection  services managed by local scrap metal recyclers, paddlers, waste col- lectors, etc. The second practice is widely used in developing countries  where recycling is done by a crude process such as acid leaching.  Identifying “disposal pattern ” is one of the significant issues of con- sumers ’ behavior that can provide valuable information on the existing  e-waste collection system and opportunities to improve it. This issue was  investigated in most of the articles . In the following  sub-sections, issues related to consumers ’ disposal behavior are  reviewed. Table S5  provides in-depth details of each of the  articles at the country level, highlighting the main research problems  identified in the articles.  4.2.3.1. Mode of disposal. Fig. 15 shows the top disposal methods  identified by the articles reviewed. Overall, “store at home ” is found as  the most common disposal method but is typically temporary, as discussed previously. The reason was identified by the 34% of the  article. Some of the corresponding studies mentioning this top disposal  method were research performed by Borthakur and Govind  in  India for computer and MPs; Chi et al.  in China for various small  and large electronic equipment; Islam et al.  in Australia for MPs;  Martinho et al.  in Portugal for smartphones and tablets; Miner  et al.  in Nigeria for e-waste in general; Ongondo and Williams   in UK for MPs; Shaikh et al.  in Pakistan for “screen and IT  equipment ” category; Siringo et al.  in Indonesia for large and IT  equipment category; Wieser and Troger  in Austria for MPs; and  Zhang, L. et al.  in China for personal IT equipment. Besides the  top methods shown in Fig. 15, some other notable methods of e-waste  disposal were identified which are presented in Table 7. In-depth details  of the studies are given in Table S5 in the SI of this review article.  Depending upon the types and socio-economic conditions of con- sumers, e-waste flows at different channels. For example, Song et al.   mentioned that people from less developed areas preferred to  give MPs to friends, relatives, and other organizations while waste ACs  and PCs were sent to manufacturers. On the other hand, Bovea, M.D.  et al.  found that “I threw it in the trash ” and “I replaced it with  another type of appliance ” were the primary method and reasons for  disposal, respectively for SE. For DCs, “collection by manufacturers ” and  “at electronic retail stores ” were standard practices in Japan (Kurisu  et al., 2020 ).  Delivering e-waste to various recycling channels existed a practice  among consumers. For example, Wang et al.  mentioned that  41.79% of residents used various recycling channels, 36.79% discarded Product lifespan   E-book  readers Desktop  computer Laptops Hard  disks  drive Global  positioning  system  navigators   Radio  alarm  clocks  .

Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 16e-waste with municipal waste, while 21.62% stored e-waste at home.  Although there was a high percentage of users using recycling channels,  it is believed that informal sector e-waste collectors are one of them. For  example, Ongondo and Williams  found that selling is happening  among consumers, companies, or individuals. Singh et al.  found  that most consumers disposed of their e-waste to informal e-waste col- lectors and recyclers. Chi et al.  in China found the same. Informal  sector e-waste disposal practice was considered as loss of energy and  resources due to its unfriendly recycling nature .  Despite the fact, Borthakur and Govind  found, “I sell them to the  scrap dealers ” or ‘kawariwalas ’ as one of the disposal paths from where  consumers got benefits. A similar result was found by Abbondanza and  Souza  .  Donation is often considered as a gift from the donors (Ongondo and  Williams, 2011 ). It is a product lifespan extension process that reduces  EG . Lau et al.  mentioned the entity of  donation as “donated to non-profit making organizations. ”  P˘erez-Belis, V. et al.  concluded that besides the consumers  who donate used toys to family or charities, around 67.1% of the con- sumers dispose of their fractions of waste toys in domestic bins, while  32.9% of the respondents used recycling points. Nowakowski   mentioned that improper disposal practices existed among residents ’,  and many of the residents disposed of e-waste with household solid  waste and selling the item to local scrappers. In Malaysia, Othman et al.   while approximately 14% of the E-waste generated by  low-income residents would go through landfill sites. Among the young  consumers, this practice also prevails. For example, Pasiecznik et al.   found that 12% of the respondents, mostly young people, threw  their e-waste in regular household bins.  Cai et al.  identified that “sell to second-hand market ” and  “sell to the qualified enterprise ” are the two variations of selling items to  others. Gok et al.  found the first one as the preferred method by  the consumers. The authors also mentioned that “wait for the  door-to-door recovery ” was widely used for ACs, WMs, and refrigerators  and also for products that consumers perceived requiring “high repair  cost or cannot be repaired. ” Ravindra and Mor  specifically  mentioned “selling it to the second-hand dealer. ” Self-disassembly and  second-hand use were found by Chi et al.  . Wieser and Troger   identified that trading-in or selling MPs was performed for  younger aged MPs to make a new mobile phone purchase. Kumar   mentioned that company-owned showrooms, authorized dealers, and  distributors as organized channels and second-hand goods shops and  repair shops as unorganized channels were the two primary paths for  mobile waste disposal.  4.2.3.2. Main disposed items – the product flow. Casey et al.   mentioned that e-waste type typically has gone through 4 different  stages, including 1) inactive EEE, 2) critical moment, 3) transition from  EEE to WEEE, and 4) divestment. Consumers ’ disposal practices largely  determine the final routes of e-waste . Dindarian  et al.  postulated that the product was discarded by customers ’  choice, not for the latest technology. On the other hand, Wieser and  Troger  mentioned that the mode of disposal varies depending on  the replaced device ’s age. When consumers understand their mobile  phone has some value, it was preferred to reuse rather than other  channels.  Before reaching a final disposal point, products are hibernated. For  example, Dagili ßutle et al.  found that "Store and later take it to the  collection points" was the disposal method, and MPs were disposed of  the most. Afroz et al.  identified that more than one-third of the  respondents sent their unused EEE to charities and gave it to relatives  when they could not repair it. As there is no specific collection scheme  available in the country, the authors found that little fraction of e-waste  went to recycling facilities. “Self-disassembly and keep the useful parts"  were the most common disposal practice for desktop and laptop Table 6  Top cited reasons for storing devices.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 17computers . Apart from storing WMPs at home, they  were donated to relatives, friends, and charities .  For second-hand use, consumers wanted to deliver used DCs, WMs,  and laptops . Thi˘ebaud et al.  identified that  firsthand users disposed of CRT TVs and DVD players directly (at point  of disposal), while FDP TVs and monitors were sent for second-hand use.  A higher disposal rate was found for headsets and small loudspeakers  and was directly disposed of with general waste and after storage. In  India, Singh et al.  found that MPs, laptops, cameras, WMs, ACs,  heaters, geysers, LED, and LCD televisions were the major disposed  e-waste items among the participants. Huang et al.  mentioned  that "selling to waste collection centers was the main method to dispose  of waste TV sets, refrigerators, and ACs, and selling in the second-hand  markets was the key method to deal with waste PCs."  Typically, in Brazilian households, MPs were kept at home, and  audio-video equipment was sold mainly or passed along among rela- tives, friends, or charity groups . Nguyen et al.   indicated that selling or giving the appliances to other users were pri- marily adopted TVs, refrigerators, WMs, and PCs. As per a study by  Bovea, M.D. et al.  , MPs, cameras, and radio alarm clocks were  disposed of by the Spanish households. Abbondanza and Souza   found that smartphones, refrigerators, or freezers, and WMs were the  most discarded items by Brazil ’s households. Despite being a developing  country, Islam et al.  found that MPs and PC were the dominant  WEEE categories in Bangladeshi households. 4.2.3.3. Norms and perceived behavioral control. Nduneseokwu et al.   identified that infrastructure moderated the relationship be- tween two influencing factors  and  intention. Consumers who did not recycle or recycled infrequently  tended to dispose of small WEEE in the general household refuse (Darby  and Obara, 2005 ). Recycling behavior reflected in practice is somewhat  related to the economic status of participants. Those who already had a  recycling habit do not have an interest in incentives (Botelho et al.,  2016 ). Pandebesie et al.  showed that willingness to separate  e-waste among consumers was relatively high, and they were aware of  the importance of separated waste.  Echegaray and Hansstein  mentioned that “product disposal  practices remain hardly influenced by favorable views towards the  environment ”. On the other hand, education had an impact on disposal  behavior. For example, Saritha et al.  found in their survey that  41.2% of the respondents would consider disposing of old products in an  eco-friendly manner, while 94% agreed to return it to the manufacturer  for free if the latter claimed to recycle products in an eco-friendly  manner. Technical knowledge of product use also influences an in- dividual ’s perception regarding disposal. For example, Jayaraman et al.   showed that social consequences and the conviction of in- dividuals ’ laptop disposal practices strongly depend on knowledge of  computer literacy.  4.2.3.4. Influencing factors-associated with disposal decision. Infrastruc - ture was found as one of critical factors that determined willingness,  positive behavior and attitude towards e-waste recycling and selecting  disposal routes . Table 8 shows some of the  other factors affecting consumers disposal decision.  The reasonable distance was critical for recycling infrastructure  . In developing countries, the informal sector e-waste  collection is generally expected. Consumers preferred to deliver e-waste  to the channel due to economic benefits , as e-waste  is considered a valuable commodity .  Central processing units  of DCs, computer monitors, keyboards,  mice, printers, cellular phones, and landline telephones were considered  valuable e-waste . Furthermore, if e-waste is not  repaired, it is thrown away; buying a new one is a common trend  . On the other hand, Blake et al.  found that  design , marketing and fashion trends, or the  speed of technology advancement were the main factors for high  disposal.  Tan et al.  found that consumers expect to receive specific  revenue for various disposal modes. “The difference between the high  Fig. 15.Top disposal methods of e-waste.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 18expectations of obsolete MPs and the actual collection price was also an  important factor leading to a high ratio of MPs stored at home. ” Simi- larly, Deng et al.  found that consumers kept the phones due to the  low price for second-hand phones in the second-hand market. Identi - fying “best exchange offers and price ” is the most critical factor for  product return . Similar result was also identified by  Dwivedy and Mittal  . In that case, Kumar  argued that  organized channels could provide incentives to consumers under the  buyback scheme.  In terms of the e-waste collection method, Chi et al.  found  that consumers demanded to “collect other municipal wastes, ” “free  door-to-door collection, ” “collect during a non-working time, ” “easy  access to collectors, ” “provide repairing and cleaning service. ” The in- fluence of online internet-based collection systems is gaining popularity;  however, understanding consumers ’ preferences regarding modes (on- line and offline) of collecting e-waste  was found  paramount .  Product use could also be an indicator of the e-waste disposal trend.  For example, Li et al.  indicated that respondents with high in- come or good education possessed most high-tech household appliances  advanced in technology and had the flexibility to use.  4.2.3.5. Impact of socio-economic variables in disposal behavior. Several  studies applied statistical methods. Several independent socioeconomic  variables were found significant; however, it is often hard to generalize  the predictability of behavior indicators, mainly because of externalities  . For  example, Abbondanza and Souza  found that regional variation   influenced disposal  behavior. Some common variables are mentioned in Table 9.  Botelho et al.  found that ’exchange for money ’ (mainly  demanded by males) was the expected incentive in Portugal, followed by  ’exchange for new EEE, ’ ’discount coupons on services ’ (females and  consumers with a high level of education), ’collection of EEE at home ’  . Income and occupation, mainly in the environmental sector,  influenced factors using e-commerce and professional recycling sites  .  Othman et al.  found that approximately 86% of the e-waste  generated by low-income residents would go through four options of a  waste management system, i.e., reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and  recycling. On the other hand, Song et al.  concluded that Macau  residents did not consider the small financial benefit of selling discarded  electronic products, which was different from mainland Chinese resi- dents. In terms of e-waste sorting, Dagili ßutle et al.  found that  females preferred to do. For product-focused disposal behavior, Dwiv - edy and Mittal  found that in India, the age of waste microwave  ovens was relatively shorter, and consumers who were between 35 and  60 years old, owned cars, and were of middle to high income discarded  most of the ovens.  4.2.3.6. Barriers associated to disposal. Ardi et al.  found that  consumers ’ disposal behavior was primarily influenced by lacking  well-established collection systems. Siringo et al.  found that only  2% of respondents voluntarily participated in formal e-waste recycling.  Disposal using municipal waste was also a popular choice due to the  unavailability of appropriate options . High repair  cost/cannot also be repaired found to be the critical barrier for which  e-waste is stored or unrepaired . Cao et al.   indicated that due to "OFN," LE was going to formal channels; however,  small-sized mobiles and cameras were stored at home and remained idle  without incentives.  4.2.3.7. Collection system/online recycling platforms. For a successful e-  waste management system, reverse logistics is a critical aspect that has  been investigated in several articles. On the other hand, incentives are given to consumers, essentially motivate them to dispose of e-waste in  the system. Policy associated with regulatory intervention and actors ’  involvement in an e-waste recycling platform showed considerable  impact on a collection system. Appropriate disposal behavior depends  on consumers ’ awareness and knowledge regarding collection channels  and online recycling platforms. Articles that discussed the issues as  mentioned above are analyzed in the following subsections.  4.2.3.7.1. Reverse logistics. As seen earlier, infrastructural factors,  such as availability and convenient  recycling facilities, were  one of the critical components of an efficient collection system (Ndu- neseokwu et al., 2017 ) and Dagili ßutle et al.  indicated that con- sumer demanded more collection points/containers. Convenience  appears to matter, as the number of consumers decreases with the in- crease of recycling centers distance . Similar  result was found by Saphores et al.  . Favot and Grassetti   found that population density is negatively correlated with the kg of  e-waste collected. The number of collection points, % of female, % of  waste separately collected were positively correlated with kg of E-waste  collected. Rodrigues et al.  identified that the number of dis- carded units and the number of households were two critical parameters  for RL system design. Convenient transport facilities were also critical,  especially for SE disposal for low-income residents (Darby and Obara,  2005 ). Darby and Obara  also found that consumers needed in- formation on how to dispose of WEEE and where it should be put for  recycling for LE category. It is not clear under what circumstances  consumers disposed of their items with household refuse or in the gen- eral waste at civic amenity  sites for SE. This problem is also iden- tified by Botelho et al.  in Portugal. Sorting should be considered  an essential task at the initial stage of RL system development; however,  this issue is less concerned. Although, Gok et al.  found that  sorting e-waste from other types of waste was performed by 28% of the  participants, mostly YUSs.  For young consumers, multiple options should be provided. Ongondo  and Williams  concluded that students ’ union facilities and li- braries were the preferred central locations for disposal. Zhang, L. et al.   mentioned that “university students intend to choose online  recycling platforms to dispose of obsolete electronics. ” Regarding online  collection platforms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, atti- tude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have a positive  impact, while perceived risk has a negative impact on the behavioral  intentions of Chinese millennials on the adoption of online e-waste  collection platforms .  4.2.3.7.2. Key attributes - provision of incentives. Cost of delivery (by  consumers) to the collection system and receiving incentives were the  two significant attributes of a successful system. Blake et al.   found that consumers preferred to disposal cost to be collected at the  product purchase point. Offering discounts/cashback during new  product purchases could be significant for greater participation (Mar- tinho et al., 2017 ). Nixon et al.  conclude that California house - holds preferred a combined service provision - "drop-off recycling at  regional centers," with "curbside recycling" including other options such  as Pay-As-You-Throw , deposit-refund program at retail  locations.  Park et al.  found that a "free of charge door-to-door collection  system" was preferred by most of the respondents, and in that case,  public relation activities should be increased. There is a need for direct  communication and booking channel with visiting engineers at the  e-waste collection facility , which the consumers  preferred. Due to the absence of a door-to-door collection system and  incentive options, often there is a high chance that consumers deliver  e-waste to the informal sector . Selling waste EEE items  to local small scrap dealers to get economic benefits was the most  preferred choice . Miner et al.  identified that  due to the lack of a door-to-door collection program, e-waste storage  behavior was accelerated. In this regard, Pierron et al.  mentioned  that the stockpiled small e-waste category represented a vital source of M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 19revenue.  Cao et al.  mentioned that different economic and internet  penetration levels were the two main factors for developing efficient  collection channels within a region. “Third-party integrated network  platform integrate online, and offline resources were predicted to be  widespread under the rapid development of IT and e-commerce. On the  other hand, Yin et al.  mentioned that consumers demanded  official channel incentives. For WMPs, door-to-door collection services  were not preferred. Zhang, B. et al.  indicated that peddlers ’  on-site collection was still the dominant way of e-waste disposal and  e-commerce and professional recycling site were far less competitive.  The authors also found that the e-waste disposal rate among low income   consumers were less while consumers with  incomeF10,000 RMB/month preferred e-waste collection by peddlers,  e-commerce. Young consumers  preferred to use  e-commerce sites for e-waste disposal, while older people did not.  4.2.3.7.3. Policy-oriented regulatory intervention and actors ’  involvement. Convenience and policy effectiveness influenced the youth  e-waste disposal intention . At the  product-level, Tan et al.  mentioned that WEEE-related regulation  is expected to affect mobile phone collection positively. Chung et al.   found that despite the absence of a producer responsibility  scheme  in the current EMS, customers still disposed of their  e-waste in the appropriate channels .  Trust and quality of e-waste collection service (especially who and  how involved in the system) were found to be significant factors among  consumers. Consumers ’ trust is critical for market competitiveness for  the recycling industry, and involvement and endorsement of the recy- cling industry and government were imperative . For  example, Song et al.  indicated that consumers demanded gov- ernment departments or other organizations to be involved in the  e-waste disposal, mostly a well-developed collection system that  included a component “telephone reservation. ” In China, the “Green Box  Program ” and “OFN activity ”  were the two official  disposal channels that consumers utilized . On the other  hand, Liu et al.  concluded that consumers preferred  government-operated facilities or through the collection by communi - cations operators and retailers.  Furthermore, Martinho et al.  mentioned that producer re- sponsibility organizations , private entities (including  non-government organizations ) could be potential places for  sustainable disposal locations; however, a lack of knowledge regarding  such available options was evident. Kumar  argued that multinational mobile manufacturing companies had collection points in  India, while local companies had no take-back mechanisms, and more  than half failed to provide information on physical collection points.  Araujo et al.  found that consumers preferred to have e-waste  collection by manufacturer or seller. Second-hand retail shops should  also be responsible, as Cao et al.  found that “sell to second-hand  stores ” and “sell to after-sales repair stations ” were the two dominant  choices.  Echegaray and Hansstein  mentioned that the government  should take advantage of municipal garbage collection systems (that  may include a segregated solid waste collection) and manufacturers ’ or  retailers ’ point of disposal of e-waste to enforce current regulations.  Awasthi and Li  argued that non-government organizations   could play a vital role in mediating consumers ’ improper  disposal behavior where socio-cultural circumstances, lack of advanced  technology and infrastructure, and environmental considerations are  limited. Besides, manufacturers and municipalities should be more  active and involved in collection activities . It is  necessary to promote legal ways of disposal or prepare scrapyards for  large e-waste equipment .  4.2.3.7.4. Impact of awareness and perception on disposal decision.  Environmental awareness was cited in the literature as a key factor  influencing disposal behavior . Jayaraman et al.   mentioned that individual awareness had a positive impact on  laptop disposal behavior. Giving information about e-waste and its  environmental risks would significantly increase proper disposal  behavior , as a significant number of consumers did not  have information about where to dispose of the e-waste (Dindarian  et al., 2012 ). Gilal et al.  mentioned that WOM significantly  impacted consumers ’ e-waste disposal behavior, which also motivated  acting to recycle appropriately. Furthermore, well-designed and  door-stepping delivery of the campaigns could potentially shape con- sumers ’ disposal behavior for the items. Botelho et al.  found that  lack of awareness of consumers, delivery of e-waste-related information,  and the consumers ’ socio-demographic factors significantly affected  consumers ’ motivation to return e-waste.  4.2.4. Analyzing consumers ’ R&R behavior  In the light of the CE principle, R&R is the first step of the entire  closed-loop chain that extends the product lifespan and reclaim the  value of used EEE. However, the researchers have not investigated this  issue extensively; only 8% of the articles (mostly from developed  countries) discussed this specific consumer behavior.  4.2.4.1. Product design perspectives. Chuang and Liao  examined  consumer-driven innovation in green product designing, considering  Taiwanese residents focusing on the digital camera. Using conjoint  analysis, the authors found that consumers ’ innovative design ideas  could significantly improve product design, and this issue should be  considered in designing energy-related products. P˘erez-Belis et al.   showed that 9.56% of the consumers had never repaired any  products that fall under the small e-waste category, while 0.75% of the Table 8  Factors affecting consumers ’ e-waste disposal decision.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 20participants bought second-hand small EEE. The study results also  revealed that consumers demanded product information (in terms of  design and labeling) and the products ’ durability. On the other hand,  83.7% of the respondents of Dagili ßutle et al.  ’s survey repaired  MPs when it was malfunctioning. Central problems of MPs were with the  battery, software, button/buttons stop functioning, malfunctioning  during power on/off . However, Wieser and  Troger  stated that MPs’ perceived speed of obsolescence was  vital for repair and reuse. Chi et al.  mentioned that cell phones,  TVs, laptops, and refrigerators are the major products, which have sig- nificant room for recirculation by repairing. Othman et al.   mentioned that manufacturers should design products that are easily  repairable and incorporate recycled content and remanufactured  components.  4.2.4.2. Barriers to repair and reuse. Bhatt et al.  found that re- spondents preferred to buy new MPs instead of repairing and reusing  them due to the higher repair cost. It was also found valid for other types  of electronic products . The same reason  identified by Echegaray  and the author mentioned that the  product-repair market remains underdeveloped due to manufacturers ’  intention for higher returns selling new products. This reason is not only  prevalent in a developing country but also in developed countries.  Consumers from the developed country can buy a new EEE product  instead of repairing as there is hardly any cost difference. This con- tributes to increased EG, with Blake et al.  finding that ’lack of  ability to repair/the cost to repair ’ was one of the significant drivers for  EG.  Sabbaghi and Behdad  found that consumers have robust  repair behavior for products, but that the cost of manufacturers ’ repair  service can be a significant inhibitor, resulting in losses for both con- sumers and manufacturers. The authors also estimated that WTP for  repairing decreased at an annual rate of 6.7%. Yla-Mella et al.   found that reliability, perceived shorter product lifespan due to fast  technical progress, and the existence of new budget models were the  main reasons not to purchase used phones.  Another perspective of R&R is the second-hand market of the reus- able product. Dindarian et al.  found that current product design  and the lack of market for second-hand items are significant barriers to  product reuse. Bovea et al.  showed that except for minor repairs  of heaters, toasters, and vacuum cleaners, most SE category products  were not repaired. Availability of cheap spare parts and difficulties  during the disassembly process were the main constraints for repairing.  The study also found that only 9.6% of respondents repaired their  small-EEE, while less than 1% bought second-hand products from the  repair shop. The reasons are also found valid for components (e.g.,  battery) of MPs and computers and accessories .  Lack of knowledge about repair and waiting periods were also critical  for repair activities .  4.2.4.3. Environmentally sustainable products. Bovea, M. et al.   inspected consumers ’ preferences in product design and labeling that  can contribute to the CE, considering durability, repair-ability, recycled  material content, low environmental impact, fair working conditions,  and origin. They found that Spanish consumers were concerned about  fair working conditions and durability of products. Kumar   mentioned that the repair-related secondary market is mostly dominated  by the informal sector, which has a relatively low-performance recir- culating product in an environmentally friendly manner. The authors  mentioned that extending lifespan is also an indicator of environmental  products. P˘erez-Belis et al.  found that respondents who repaired  appliances  were using the  products for more than four years. On the other hand, for cheaper  electronics, the cost of repair is generally found high. Thi˘ebaud et al.   mentioned that after repair products ’ average service life is extended by at least 30%.  4.2.4.4. Secondhand product purchase. Second-hand product purchase is  a relatively common practice in developing countries; for example,  Abbondanza and Souza  mentioned second-hand product acqui - sition from donations and directly from past users.  Bovea, M.D. et al.  found that more than half of the partici - pants  never repaired broken e-waste items, while 87.6% of the  respondents never bought second-hand EEE items. Similar results were  found by P˘erez-Belis, V. et al.  for electronic toys in Spain. Chung  et al.  found that consumers would buy second-hand products if  the reconditioned product ’s price were substantially lower than new  products, durability and performance of the reconditioned product is  guaranteed, and finally, the warranty level is similar to that of new  products. The authors also mentioned that there should be an authori - tative quality assurance scheme that might take responsibility for  reconditioned products. Lacking the factors mentioned above in  repaired products, 88% of the respondents of Fraige et al.  ’s study  were not interested in purchasing second-hand products. Even though  people bought the products, that was mainly due to economic reasons  and for temporary use. These factors were also mentioned by Yla-Mella  et al.  and Rodrigues et al.  in their research.  Environmental education largely influences environmental  behavior, specifically on second-hand product purchases (P˘erez-Belis, V.  et al., 2015a ). A higher percentage of households reused their old cell  phones than TV sets . Borthakur and  Govind  found that instead of repairing, consumers tended to  purchase a new phone due to repair cost, which was the primary reason  for new product purchase, followed by new product features, status  symbol, and the ripple effect of other people purchasing new products.  Borthakur and Singh  found that un-repairability was the main  reason for purchasing a new phone while repairing was an alternative  reason. The authors also mentioned that repair shop owners also  discourage consumers from repairing, as there are insignificant differ - ences between repair costs and new product purchases. The repair shops  are also acting as a selling point for second-hand items. As consumers  have less intention to buy second-hand products, the shops might hold  their repaired items for longer, an indirect economic loss involved in the  process.  Echegaray  mentioned that consumers believed that their  e-waste was beyond repair in most cases, although deliberate lifespan  curtailment by producers or consumers directly influenced this  perspective. In that case, symbolic and planned obsolescence was both  critical and existed. Consumers experience a technology-driven push   and barriers in extending product lifespan, which  was often a difficult choice assessing cost and benefits (of product  repairing).  Rodrigues et al.  identified those vacuum cleaners, radio re- ceivers, CRT displays, and freezers were some of the devices that had the  opportunity for reuse. Second-hand items as gifts from others were not  expected for printers, sandwich toasters, grills, and electric toasters.  Notebooks, CRT displays, radio receivers, and computers could be  considered during second-hand purchases. The authors also found that  the main reasons for not buying second-hand items were "new EEE is  better," cheaper, and guaranteed and mistrust of the durability of used  EEE, which is evident in most developed countries. Smartphones and  tablets have reuse potential .  4.2.5. Analyzing consumers ’ recycling behavior  Recycling behavior often overlaps with disposal behavior. Around  16% of the articles explored the behavior, investigating either con- sumers recycle their product or not (disposed of in a formal collection  facility), any monetary incentives demanded by the consumers or not, or  in some cases, consumers preferences in selecting recycling facilities  among various available options. WTP was another aspect investigated M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 21by the articles to identify how much of the recycling fees consumers  were willing to pay if any system requires it. This issue was mainly  discussed from the developing countries ’ context because no specific  collection and recycling options are available to the customer.  4.2.5.1. Willingness to participate in a recycling system. Besides, WTP  consumers ’ motivation/willingness towards participating in the formal  e-waste recycling system was one of the discussed issues in the investi - gated articles. In the section, recycling-related determining factors from  the consumers ’ end were analyzed. On the other hand, socio-economic  factors, such as age, income, education, and others, impacted recy- cling behavior. Specific characteristics of the formal recycling systems  were analyzed as well, which were found to influence consumers ’  participation in a recycling system.  4.2.5.1.1. Determining factors. According to Zhang, Y. et al.  ,  compensation mode, collection price, and convenience degree were the  three determining factors that enhanced participation of customers in a  MP recycling system. Thi Thu Nguyen et al.  found “social pres- sure”, while Li et al.  found “inconvenience of recycling ” as the  factor. Martinho et al.  found awareness of the recycling program  and better communication strategies regarding recycling services were  the two critical factor that could enhance consumers ’ participation. Such  factors were also identified by Milovantseva and Saphores  , in  addition to “cost of recycling ” and “laws and regulations ”.  On the other hand, Otto et al.  mentioned that environmental  motivation and behavioral costs were the main factors where the latter  could be manipulated within the short term. In addition to that, envi- ronmental awareness and recycling prices were also critical (Cai et al.,  2020 ). Siringo et al.  mentioned the importance of recycling  intention, information, and recycling convenience for participation.  From the RL perspective, Blake et al.  found that the structure of  the services available, including provision and cost, was significant.  Siringo et al.  found similar findings.  4.2.5.1.2. Socio economic factors and influencing components of TPB.  Jafari et al.  found that household income, household size, edu- cation, e-waste awareness, and marital status were the main factors for  consumers ’ incentive dependency. Kumar  found that for young  consumers, 1) attitude; 2) perceived control; 3) subjective norm and 4)  individual responsibility were the main influencing factors, while con- venience and awareness did not have any influence on the behavior.  Saphores et al.  found that moral norms, toxicity knowledge  about the toxic content in e-waste, and recycling at work/school posi- tively influence recycling behavior. Colesca et al.  indicated that  recycling knowledge, pro-environmental norms, and institutional sup- port had a moderate effect on recycling behavior. Saphores et al.   found that gender, education, convenience, and environmental beliefs  had a strong relationship with the willingness to recycle, while income  or political affiliation were found insignificant. Table 10 shows the  significant and not significant socio-economic and demographic vari- ables responsible for e-waste recycling behavior.  Recycling behavior is strongly influenced by a “sense of duty ” and  perceived control, rather than subjective norms and benefits (Kumar,  2017 ). Nduneseokwu et al.  and Wang et al.  both  mentioned that attitude, subjective norm, and environmental knowl - edge significantly influenced consumers ’ intentions to recycle. The  mediating factor, such as infrastructure, influenced attitude and sub- jective norm and intention. On the other hand, pro-environmental ac- tivities and attitudes toward recycling small household electronics were  essential in recycling the specific category of e-waste. Moral norms and  environmental beliefs to recycle e-waste and to engage in  pro-environmental behaviors were found critical. In e-waste recycling,  subjective norms played a more significant role than the other constructs  of TPB . Similar trend was observed  by Wang et al.  . Papaoikonomou et al.  found that total  attitude , WTP, information status, and subjective norm were other significant factors of WEEE recycling.  4.2.5.1.3. Characteristics of formal recycling system. Yla-Mella et al.   found that convenience and proximity of recycling facilities and  service should be considered as the main characteristics of a successful  recycling system. Nixon et al.  showed the importance of the  factor as well coupled with the factor “cost”. On the other hand, in  addition to these factors, Wang et al.  mentioned about economic  benefits. “Need for more collection points ”  and  “refund system ”  were identified as the success fac- tors of a recycling system by Dagili ßutle et al.  .  A centralized collection facility (One-stop drop-off points for all  types of e-waste) could be an additional factor . Of  course, residential conditions and recycling habits were significant is- sues in such aspects . However, Lakhan   identified that perceived environmental harm and visible fees (as a  sticker on to a product) are strongly associated, which should be  considered as counter-productive factors for WTP. Providing the solu- tion to this problem, Dwivedy and Mittal  proposed that visible  and transparent fees and exchangeable sponsorship (where the ARF  collected for one category of products is used to sponsor recycling of  another category of products) in terms of fees should be implemented.  Service-level integration could be built by E-waste recycling coupons,  given to householders via rates payment receipts (of local councils ’ rates  for general waste collection services) . The monetary  influence was positively and significantly associated with the product  take-back efforts, especially for young consumers (Ongondo and Wil- liams, 2011 ). Song et al.  mentioned that increasing the pop- ulation ’s education level and propagandizing e-waste knowledge to  promote residents ’ understanding should be considered a long-term and  short-term approach, respectively.  4.2.5.2. Formal e-waste collection channel and EPR. Ramzan et al.   mentioned that voluntary-based formal programs have fewer  chances to ensure consumers ’ participation. Blake et al.  identi - fied that cost to recycle and lack of knowledge are the two barriers to  success for the voluntary program. Qu et al.  mentioned that  collection price and collector ’s quality certification were the two critical  attributes selecting collection services among the consumers. In terms of  service preference, compensation mode, collection price, and conve - nience degree were the most significant factors for a formal collection  channel .  Tan et al.  found that convenience of collection facilities at  various locations, and a guarantee of information security was the  leading product return performance indicators. Arain et al.  found  incentives and broader product coverage (especially small-sized  e-waste) as the indicators. When delivering products, "make appoint - ment online or by phone first then have it picked up by the recycler" was  the preferred method of collection among consumers .  Arain et al.  identified that factors for accessibility to recycling  centers were pick-up services, e-waste drives, or providing a recycling  drop-off center near campus. Bouvier and Wagner  identified that  recycling fees and frequency of the recycling facilities ’ opening were  negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with the number of  waste TV sets and monitors collected  in the recy- cling facilities. Otto et al.  identified collection cost reduction  techniques as  curbside collection and deposit containers as a direct  approach, and  the material and social enticements as an indirect  approach.  4.2.5.3. WTP for formal EMS. Li et al.  found that young con- sumers were more in favor of “charging for discarding the product ” for a  formal EMS, and it varied from 0% to 5% of the recycling fees for the  products. Similar result was found by Ramzan et al.  . On the other  hand, Liu et al.  found that consumers ’ WTP for e-waste has not  increased for WMPs. Chung et al.  identified some preconditions M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 22of the WTP. They found that collecting recycling fees involves some  critical issues, such as  a high degree of transparency (using recycling  funds),  levied recycling fee,  visibility of the fees,  fees paid  directly to manufacturers,  cost that covers proper recycling, and  finally,  fees paid at the point of purchase. In terms of method of  payment, Dwivedy and Mittal  mentioned that a scheme charging  after product take-back occurred is more preferred than advanced  recycling fees . Lakhan  proposed that fees could be  collected as "environmental handling fees are a form of tax."  Even though manufacturers should be responsible solely for the  environment, consumers were willing to pay voluntarily to improve the  environment . For example,  Afroz et al.  found that 52.5% of the residents showed a positive  attitude towards WTP for recycling system development. On the other  hand, Huang et al.  ’s study showed that 70% of the respondents  were willing to pay for environmental improvement in China, while 80%  purchasing environment friendly products. The amount of recycling cost  that was agreed by the consumers   was 0–5% of recycling cost  , 5%–10%  of the product cost , 10% of the product price  , 1–2% of the product market price (Dwivedy and  Mittal, 2013 ). The quantitative assessment showed that the mean  monthly fee of WTP agreed among residents in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  was US$8.09 per household , while Song et al.   found that in China, the mean WTP lower and upper values were US  $2.20 and US$ 2.81 US dollar, respectively. Cai et al.  found the  amount as US$ 4.10 per month. For product-specific WTP, Arain et al.   identified that US$12.60 to recycle a 32∕∕television, and US$2.90  to recycle a battery, US$11.30 for a laptop, US$7.80 for a cell phone.  Arain et al.  also found that batteries, cell phones, and 32∕∕tele- visions, laptops were among the top products for which consumers were  willing to pay a recycling fee. Liu et al.  found that some partic - ipants thought that paying for e-waste recycling is unrealistic. Same  issue was previously identified by Afroz et al.  . Song et al.   found that the reasons behind not willing to pay for recycling vary  substantially depending on the participants ’ socioeconomic condition.  For example, some consumers believed that it is the government ’s re- sponsibility  . As the  informal sector pays consumers economic benefits, for this reason, most  consumers felt reluctant to pay fees . Low  household income and satisfaction with the current situation were also  found to be the reasons for such a negative attitude .  In addition to that, Dwivedy and Mittal  also found that higher  cost of living, lack of time, and non-mandated regulations were some of  the other causes of the attitude.  According to Afroz et al.  , education level, age, and household  income significantly impacted households ’ WTP for improving the  WEEE management system. Similar results were found by Song et al.   . Li et al.  mentioned that educational level and awareness  of recycling WEEE positively influenced WTP while income level did  not.  4.2.5.4. Reverse logistics. According to Chung et al.  , existing RL  system should be more convenient, reliable, and accessible to con- sumers. Similar results were found from Yla-Mella et al.  ’s study.  Favot and Grassetti  found that additional collection points would  enhance e-waste collection rate. Regarding the collection channels,  more specifically for MPs, drop-off bins at retail stores and wireless  service provider stores would be potential locations (Milovantseva and  Saphores, 2013a ).  mentioned of  mail-back services with incentives as the potential method. Ongondo  and Williams  mentioned about library. Otto et al.   mentioned about central locations for arranging e-waste collection  event. For recycling service selection, Bai et al.  proposed that  recycling services would positively impact new MPs’ sales. Consumers would choose a seller with the recycling service over other (conven - tional) sellers, and the price was given importance over convenience.  Deng et al.  found that “price ” , "ease of  execution," "ease of contact," "ease of finding the location," "appropriate  method of treatment/mobile phone recycling," and "service time" were  the key variables in consumers ’ recycling experience. For highly-priced  MPs, rewards are expected, and for cheaper models, convenience (Bai  et al., 2018 ). However, two main barriers act in the process, specifically,  for convenience degree of collection mode - excessive time and money  . To minimize the RL process complexity and cost,  Bai et al.  proposed that third-party recycling campaigns,  convenient online second-hand transaction platforms would be benefi - cial. Jafari et al.  mentioned that government support and private  sector investment, awareness-building efforts should be the focus on  areas of RL process optimization.  4.2.5.5. Informal sector. The informal sector is one of the key actors in  the recycling chain and contributes to the circulation of materials and  products. In other words, the informal sector influenced recycling  behavior . Lau et al.  found that selling e-waste  to private  e-waste collectors was the most preferred way  among consumers due to perceived convenience. Environmental  awareness, attitude, perceptions regarding informal recycling, and in- come were the direct determinants, whereas costs of recycling, social  norms, and publicity were indirect factors selecting informal sector  e-waste collectors . Cao et al.  identified that  leading collectors ’ channels for e-waste were street peddlers, appliance  repairing stores, waste collection stations, and dismantling workshops.  On the other hand, Zhang, B. et al.  found street peddlers,  e-commerce sites and professional collection sites were the main chan- nels. The informal sector ’s main characteristics providing collection  services were convenient, flexible, accessible, acceptability of a wide  range of e-waste categories .  4.2.5.6. Online-recycling platform. With the digital data-driven society,  consumers are more willing to use online-based services for product  purchase and product disposal. Zhang, L. et al.  found that young  students  are preferred to use online  recycling platforms. Incentives are found interrelated with the willing - ness to participate in an online recycling platform. For example, Wang Table 10  Factors affecting e-waste recycling behavior.

Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 23et al.  found that willingness to deliver e-waste to online plat- forms was positively influenced by perceived behavioral control, sub- jective norms, attitudes, and economic motivation. Wang et al.   also found that due to more significant economic benefits, willingness to  participate in the platforms is higher than traditional  section  collection and recycling.  4.2.5.7. Critical barriers to recycling. Some of the critical barriers need  to be focused on an efficient recycling system. For example, Liu et al.   and Bai et al.  found that information leakage, incentive,  and convenience must be considered for any recycling system, while Thi  Thu Nguyen et al.  found that the inconvenience of recycling was  negatively correlated to residents ’ recycling behavioral intention. For  waste MPs, Saritha et al.  identified the main reasons for not  recycling were lack of formal collection channels, and price of returned  product. On the other hand, Tan et al.  found ‘low public  awareness of collection responsibility ’ and ‘insufficient promotion of  formal collection ’ were the reasons associated to that. According to  Fraige et al.  , cost of recycling , lack of  recycling plants, lack of legislation and management systems, lack of  awareness, lack of public trust regarding recycled equipment, and the  unstable generation of WEEE that needs recycling were the main bar- riers. Gu et al.  mentioned that consumers ’ lack of awareness  regarding the appropriate destination of e-waste (“do not know where to  send waste ”), unexpected privacy disclosure, troublesome procedure,  and lack of public awareness were the critical barriers to the recycling  system.  5.Results and discussion  To enable a smooth transition towards CE, a multifaceted approach  involved integrated measures is critical. This section discusses possible  policy initiatives towards sustainable EM and business model innovation  from the CE viewpoint, based on the in-depth literature review pre- sented in section 4. Table A1  provides a consumer-  centric CE framework that connects the critical elements of CE build - ing blocks, actors involved, sectoral perspective, and associated path- ways of CE . This addresses a key gap  in academic research to date by integrating all of these aspects in a single  framework that focuses on consumer behavior and e-waste. This is  potentially advantageous for developing national-level strategies and  policies, with Table A1 also enabling the identification of future research  opportunities. Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 discuss policy implications  and business model development, respectively, in order to answer RQ1  in relation to the need for an operational framework to achieve CE  around e-waste. Specifically, Section 5.3 addresses the major research  gaps and potential future research opportunities in the research field.  5.1. Policy implications towards CE  This section discusses policy-related issues such as consumers ’  awareness improvement measures, economic incentives to consumers,  infrastructure development, and regulatory interventions. Such discus - sion would enable governments ’ effort towards developing sustainable  e-waste management systems and achieving a circular economy.  5.1.1. Consumer awareness campaigns and pathways for information  dissemination  A diverse range of consumers (households, individuals, university  students) was analyzed in the reviewed articles. There is a clear need for  increased effort to organize awareness-raising programs and publicize e-  waste collection and disposal-related information. Sector-specific pro- grams to raise public awareness should be planned and delivered, tar- geting households, schools, universities, and the private sector (Islam  et al., 2016 ). Specific education and course materials  resulted in the successful collection of small  WEEE in Spain . This approach can lead to the creation  of an entirely new consumer base across diverse countries who are  environmentally cautious and understand their roles and responsibilities  in a sustainable EMS. Awareness-raising campaigns should include  e-waste sorting, associated service providers, available disposal  methods, material content, recycling campaigns, environmental pro- tection, internet-based online collection system, and product labeling  . Additionally, if e-waste is recycled  , then information on the amount of material  and energy saved should also be the campaigns ’ components.  The government, more specifically, local government, plays a crucial  role in disseminating knowledge and information on e-waste to the  public to improve their e-waste management and recycling habits (Davis  and Herat, 2008 ). The media used for information dissemination could  be via newspaper, audiovisual, personal communication, television and  radio, websites or mobile apps, posters, information leaflets, social  media, word of mouth , pilot projects, workshops, and seminars.  Among these media, social networking sites are considered to be a  cost-effective path for delivering this information .  To reinforce moral and social norms, church groups might play a critical  role . Physical locations for disseminating infor- mation could be residential building entrances, shopping centers, and  transport . The  workplace could also be an essential place to raise awareness as working  people spend much of their time in these areas.  The contents of awareness-raising material and frequency of circu- lating the information were found to be crucial in the reviewed studies.  For information materials, attractive design and colors could be used  and feedback sheets on current service satisfaction could be added.  Product labeling with easily visible e-waste signs should be designed.  Household waste collection bins should have stickers that inform con- sumers not to dispose of their e-waste items into the bin should be  prepared . Source separation at the generation point (e.  g., households) should be encouraged for adequate recovery. Publicizing  information on the CE should also be promoted in a broader context.  5.1.2. Consumer-focused economic incentives  Economic incentives aimed at consumers are crucial to ensuring that  disposed e-waste reaches formal collection and recycling facilities.  Economic incentives can eliminate unused EEE items ’ storage behavior  and improper disposal of e-waste . Liu et al.   concluded that for value-added products, such as smartphones, in- centives are critical. Similar comment was made by Tan et al.  .  MPs’ penetration rate should be considered as a regional development  indicator. MPs often become obsolete due to "service contract ending,"  such as the case found by Martinho et al.  in Portugal. Ongondo  and Williams  found the same reason existed in UK. As MP service  operators are playing a critical role in EoL product management, one  strategy could be proving additional internet data packages to con- sumers as incentives to collect old unwanted phones.  Direct incentives such as “trade-in for cash ” , “old  for new”  or “discount/cashback offers ” (Martinho  et al., 2017 ) have been found to be practical ways of providing financial  incentives to encourage a CE for e-waste. In determining the optimal  level of incentives, the discarded  items ’ local market price  needs to be estimated, with Kumar  highlighting the importance  of understanding "consumer selling behavior" in order to determine an  appropriate incentive to return products such as MPs. This is particularly  important in developing countries with intensive competition between  the informal sector and formal e-waste collectors. However, according to  Benabou and Tirole  , incentives are weak behavior reinforcers  over the short term and negatively impact long term behavior. In- centives are also dependent on socio-demographic variables (Botelho  et al., 2016 ). Jafari et al.  stated that household size, income level,  education, and marital status were some of the variables. Students could M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 24be given monetary rewards (approximately USD 5 per student for small  household appliances) considering value retrieved from secondary ma- terials .  Deposit-return schemes should be given special attention as an  essential economic instrument . These could be  applied to both developed nations and developing countries. Despite  being a developing country, the scheme was preferred by 36% of the  Vietnamese respondents  in a Vietnamese  study . The flow of e-waste can be streamlined  under this system by establishing testing facilities and maintenance  centers for R&R, by which reclaimed products can be transferred to a  social organization for further use. Currently, a lack of legal incentives  promoting repairs and second-hand sales is considered a barrier to reuse  practice . Kahhat et al.  proposed a  deposit-refund system based on radio-frequency identification device  .  5.1.3. Infrastructure development  Wang et al.  found that the availability of collection and  recycling services to consumers significantly affect their awareness  levels. Without proper collection and recycling facilities, it is hard to  implement a  EMS . Construction and  improvement of e-waste recycling infrastructure are the first steps that  governments should take to foster increased collection and recycling  rates. Regional infrastructure development with the help of public  support has been found to be particularly vital ,  with a need for governments to subsidize investments in necessary fa- cilities. Special collection events for small and IT equipment could be  arranged. Permanent collection points and event collection in highly  populated areas could be established . An active  monitoring system identifying e-waste flows in various final disposal  points needs to be investigated by the waste management authorities  and other stakeholders through collaboration and coordination mecha - nisms. Overall, there is a clear need to bridge the information supplied to  consumers regarding formal collection and recycling facilities and local  recycling infrastructure development for enhancing consumers’ level of  awareness.  5.1.4. Legislation and regulatory interventions  Policy formulation should be focused more on consumers’ attitudes  towards e-waste, with the behavioral insights provided by the reviewed  studies used to inform government regulations and programs. To in- crease awareness around national e-waste recovery programs, it is  important to consider age, household size, income, gender, and educa - tion level. EPR implementation with government and non-government  organizations  should be given more attention. In most in- stances, existing e-waste-related regulation was found to be weak and  did not reflect consumers’ economic perspectives. The imposition of  penalties for improper disposal were also suggested by study authors  and making consumers responsible at the collection stage was found  crucial. In most of the cases, consumers from developing countries  demanded price incentives (at the time of disposal due to the presence of  informal collectors), and subsidy amounts that can motivate consumers  to choose formal collection facilities need careful attention. In connec - tion to this, regulatory reform and legally-binding provisions that make  consumers more responsible for overall EM should be considered. In- centives to informal sector e-waste collectors also need to be provided  for efficient and environmentally responsible recycling (Lau et al.,  2013).  Advanced recycling fees  mandated in e-waste-specific regu- lations are an option for mediating consumers’ disposal habits. Although  ARFs were identified by a majority of articles as a burden for consumers,  if legal obligations bound consumers to pay the fee (in the form of ARF  or recycling fees at the time of disposal). Implementing ARFs through  product pricing was also found to eliminate economic bottlenecks in an  EMS in Switzerland . Extended producer responsibility  implementation in devel - oping nations is particularly challenging as it imposes a cost on con- sumers . The prospect of EPR as a mandatory  program needs further attention from policymakers, which will even- tually restrict illegal imports and informal sector downstream recycling  process. As EPR holds manufacturers and producers accountable for  sustainable product lifecycle management, two of the indicators (of  product design) - product durability  and product  lifespan-should be directly interlinked with the EPR policy agenda.  Official take-back schemes through a compulsory retailer-based collec - tion system should be considered further, as voluntary schemes often fail  to ensure widespread public participation .  Increasing awareness among consumers is one of the fundamental  tasks of any C&RS. A lack of information regarding collection centers’  existence and locations was found to be a barrier to a CE for e-waste,  highlighting the need for a greater focus on increasing consumer  awareness in national policy planning. Milovantseva  argues that  public support for green product design regulations can increase their  likelihood of adoption by governments. Emphasis should also be placed  on providing small and medium enterprises  with incentives and  subsidies that encourage green entrepreneurship for product design and  development of local recycling facilities.  Technology transfer for implementing EPR-related initiatives should  be included in regional development planning. Training and capacity  building of formal recycling sector stakeholders need to improve.  Dwivedy and Mittal  mention that market mechanisms fail within  current EMSs due to externalities (informal sector in developing coun- tries). Innovative financing mechanisms need to be established for  setting up infrastructure in developing countries and internationaliza - tion of recycling law is needed in the light of EU WEEE Directive and  EPR. The CE package initiated by the EU could be an example for pol- icymakers in developing countries.  5.2. Business model innovation  Business model innovation is a critical aspect of a circular economy  . In this subsection, based on the in-depth literature  analysis presented in Section 4, product design, secondhand product and  supply chain, reverse logistics service provider, online markets and data  management for e-waste generation, mobile applications, and social  media and finally, charity organizations and retailer  coordination-related issues were discussed.  5.2.1. Product design  According to Chuang and Liao , "there is a pressing need to  understand cultural differences in behaviors, particularly in the context  of designing less resource-intensive products and services." Under - standing consumers’ engagement with EEE is vital to product design,  especially as the reviewed studies show that psychological undesirabil - ity has far more effect than technological obsolescence on consumer  behavior. Furthermore, it is seen that most of the consumers (regardless  of the country) tended to save old EEE for spare parts, creating oppor - tunities for modular product design and simple repairability using a  user-friendly instruction . In most cases,  product user manuals provide information on product use with limited  troubleshooting information or repair instructions. Supply of spare parts  and repair service availability are interrelated, and products and parts  manufacturers should focus on this issue during product design. Aspects  such as material use , product lifespan  related data (date of manufacturing, expected expiry date, years of  service guarantee), visible e-waste logo, and RFID based product  tracking system (to include recycling fees, monitor at the recycling  centers/improper disposal) should be integrated with product design for  sustainable EM planning. According to Dindarian et al. , there are  hardly any incentive available for designing products that facilitate  reuse. M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 255.2.2. Secondhand product and supply chain  The growing secondhand product market is evident worldwide,  primarily involving online product selling platforms such as eBay and  Gumtree . Oversight of this market by central authorities is  needed to support local business and achieve consumers’ trust in used  products. Service guarantee and quality assurance could be the key to a  thriving used product market that integrate e-waste recycling services.  The benefits of secondhand product purchase and use, and secondhand  product stores and outlets should be considered by service providers.  Incentive-supported modular repair service for WMPs could vastly  reduce rapid product replacement.  5.2.3. Reverse logistics service provider  Economic incentives given to consumers in the form of collection  price could form an integral part of the reverse logistic  service  model. The responsibilities of service providers are multifaced,  including determining the appropriate mode of compensation, and  ensuring that services are convenient to users. The cost of recycling is an  important aspect that should be visible (collected at the product pur- chase point). RL service providers must ensure the transparency of the  process, and necessary policy and regulation should be formulated to  support regular operation and maintain continuous consumer satisfac - tion. Telephone reservation and direct communication with the RL  service provider would further enhance the product return process, with  consumers preferring government-supported RL service providers for  reasons of accountability .  RL service providers may use the existing network of waste collection  authorities , and in this process, they can  educate consumers and increase awareness. In this way, consumers’ pro-  environmental behavior could be further enhanced. Local government  can play a critical role in enhancing public relations activities around e-  waste collection, , especially for WMPs. Infor- mation dissemination should be considered an essential operational  activity for both local government and service provider. Campaigns  focused on product lifespan with incentives could be organized to cap- ture high-value materials from stored or unused items .  In collecting SE e-waste, opportunities exist for new small businesses  to be developed around modular e-waste collection that, integrate OFN,  exchange offers, and cash/coupon arrangements (in the case of revers - ible items). Subjective norms have been found to be critical to e-waste  recycling, and RL service providers (both government-operated and  privately-owned under government regulation) could significantly  mediate behavioral intentions. This has the potential to reduce mobile  phone storage, which has become a social norm. RL service providers  could be standardized through certification (by government de- partments) to maintain the quality of e-waste collectors, including ca- pacity to deliver repair services specific products.  Reliability and accessibility of service (e.g., number of collection  points) was found to be critical in the articles reviewed. Generally,  population centers should be targeted , potentially  including retail stores , mobile network  service providers’ outlets , libraries, supermarkets  . The service provision of reverse  logistics arrangements should assess reasonable distance, ensuring  collection points at the centers. Free mail-back service with incentives  could also help to collect e-waste, especially for small e-waste items, as  consumers are more concerned about service time and rewards from the  collection channel. A flexible door-to-door collection could be estab - lished based on mobile apps and telephone reservations. Young con- sumers should be particularly encouraged to use online platforms for  e-waste recycling. Partnering with informal sector collectors could help  expand the collection network. Government support and policy initia - tives are mainly required for this instance, especially providing in- centives . On the other hand, establishing  relationship with charity and secondhand product stores and businesses  would bypass product flows that are generally destined for recycling only. In this aspect, consumers’ perceived behavioral control-related  issues should be closely observed, particularly any changes in recy- cling behavior in the presence of a government-supported RL service  provider.  5.2.4. Online markets and data management for EG  More products are now being sold online than ever before, and in the  recent COVID-19 pandemic, sales of electronic products have been  skyrocketing . Simultaneously, the on- line market - both new product sales and second-hand market, should be  considered an essential element of product life management. For this  case, the use of internet-of-things , “big data analytics” for  combining socio-economic data with the distribution of waste across a  geographical location, and blockchain technology could provide new  insights on consumption habits. Zhang, B. et al.  previously  mentioned the impact on big data in e-commerce sites (associated with  consumption modes) and e-waste recycling services .  urged to examine effect of blockchain technology on transportation,  material flow, and payment for WEEE collection modes. Improved data  quality on EoL product  traceability is critical for a  formal e-waste collection system . The importance of  data-oriented product labeling was found by several researchers, for  example, research by Bovea, M.D. et al.  and Huang et al. .  Major indicators of e-waste generation levels include device replace - ment rates, poor repairability, growing segment of consumer for elec- tronic products and rapid development of electronic product (Arain  et al., 2020). At household level, Fraige et al.  mentioned about  two indicators - household device penetration rates, and products’ ser- vice life. Data can be collected on product lifespan by identifying the  date of manufacturing and when consumers posted an advertisement for  a product. This way, firsthand product use characteristics (life- span-related data) could be gathered and utilized by applying various  statistical models, such as the Weibull-distribution-based sales- - stock-lifespan model.  5.2.5. Mobile applications and social media  The use of technology, especially mobile apps, to support behavioral  change is increasingly considered a useful tool to reduce e-waste (Kang  et al., 2020). Although platforms such as Love Recycling, Taolv,  Haoshou, and Baidu have already become popular platforms (Wang  et al., 2019), broader service coverage is required for this effort. Further  attention is also required around standardized price-setting and service  innovation . Government intervention  is required for online/internet-based collection platforms for e-waste  collection and recycling, as concerns over privacy are critical. These  services should be expanded not only for waste MP but also for other  e-waste items. Promoting the platform to rural and remote areas is  another key task, which could be developed using optimized artificial  intelligence  algorithms. Using AI algorithms, such as simulated  annealing, tabu search, greedy, bee colony optimization, Nowakowski  et al.  simulated e-waste collection requests. Jiang et al.   integrated IoT and subscription accounts on social media platforms for  household waste management. Providing substantial incentives and  training to local formal collectors should be considered in a smart EMS.  5.2.6. Charity organization and retailer coordination  Many used products flow to charity organizations after initial prod- uct use. The most viable donation organizations are a charity and local  schools , where product reuse is often signif - icantly higher than for other niche consumer segments. For example,  Kahhat and Williams  found that 60% of computers donated to  charitable organizations were reused. This shows that there is a sec- ondary product market (other than the conventional online EEE  selling-buying platforms), which requires specific attention. There is an  opportunity for charity organizations to provide repair services at a  larger scale, creating jobs in local communities (Islam and Huda, M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 262020c ). Technical, financial, and physical support from government,  business and philanthropic organizations is needed to support the op- erations of charitable organizations. Donation sites and information  campaigns on product reuse could be organized at schools and offices of  social service providers.  An integrated approach could be adopted that incorporates EEE re- tailers, whereby consumer might buy secondhand refurbished products  from retailers , alongside new  equipment . In that case, certification and  quality assurance would be required to achieve consumer trust and  acceptability. Retailers should be provided the necessary infrastructure  support to collect disposed items by consumers, and retailers might  provide cash/incentives to consumers. Establishing optimized collection  points for repair services and setting standardized repair price also  require further attention. Secondhand product circulation will be suc- cessful if retailers, manufacturers, service providers, governments, and  charity organizations work together.  5.3. Analysis of research gap and future research directions  After reviewing 109 articles in this work, several research gaps were  identified and analyzed in detail. These are discussed below to address  the requirement of RQ2 around the potential for further research  studies:   ≡Apart from China and India, the number of studies that have been  performed on consumer beahvior around e-waste in developing  countries is limited and requires further attention .  Germany is also a gap, with only one paper identified despite it being  one of the largest e-waste generating nations globally (Islam et al.,  2020b ). It is understood that German EM is well developed; however,  investigation on consumers ’ repair and reuse, and storage behavior  would substantially provide insight for other developed nations,  which is currently missing in the academic research.   ≡Through the policy and business model innovation discussed in  section 5.1 and in section 5.2, respectively, there is an opportunity to  study changes in consumers ’ behavior over time (before and after  interventions are implemented).   ≡Consumers from so-called innovative sities (highly IT enabled cities  or cities with high tech companies present) should be investigated  further. This was revealed as a key research opportunity in this re- view, with a potential list of cities prvided by Leskin  . This also  supports the call from Borthakur and Govind  for "more  locale-specific" studies to understand the dynamic behavior of  e-waste disposal and awareness across nations.  ≡Consumer behavior across product categories needs further atten - tion. For example, disposal behavior for SE and LE category is  entirely different. As such, how consumers act for spercific products   or for specific groups of products   require investigation. Through this, potential  improvement opportunities could be identified for specific types of  products.   ≡There is a clear opportunity for researchers to further investigate  consumer consensus around ARF systems. In some studies, the WTP  amount was investigated but the desired amount of incentives (cash  or any other method) that consumers required was not investigated.  Furthermore, WTP-related studies should focus more on imple - menting analytical methodologies such as analytical hierarchy pro- cess , analytical network process , and conjoint analysis.  In responding to WTP-related questions in a survey, pictoral repre - sentations of e-waste collection and recycling services could be  provided to deliver information to consumers about their roles and  responsibilities .  ≡The economic benefits of internet or online-based system from con- sumers ’ perspective require future research. In this regard, identi - fying flows of e-waste would be a key first step, and implementing material flow analysis  models would be beneficial. MFA is  capable of quantifying which platforms are profitable (traditional vs.  online collection) considering all the actors (e.g., government, con- sumers, network platforms, processing facilities) in the RL supply  chain .   ≡Most of the studies reviewed were focused on the individual and  household-level. Specific attention should be given to other con- sumers such as government offices, higher education institutions,  and large multi-national companies. Technological companies  should be future study areas, as mentioned by Fraige et al.  .  ≡This study identified that a smaller number of studies were con- ducted considering the young population, more specifically, students  studying at the universities. Future studies should focus on this group  of people as it is also found from the articles that this group ’s  possession rate in some of the EEE is higher than the general popu - lation, indicating that different social norms may apply to this group.   ≡Close attention is required around product return management  through follow-up research into, for example, the funding mecha - nisms needed for informal collectors, price setting for various types  of e-waste , and the role of various stake - holders in the development of facilities.   ≡Wang et al.  found that substantial differences exist in term of  e-waste storage behavior among homeowners and renters in China.  Future research should target these two groups of residents and  investigate their e-waste disposal and recycling behavior, including  in other countries. Furthermore, the authors found that income and  level of education were not significant predictors for the group, so  better statistical aspects considering other socio-economic variables  such as the number of families in the households, the number of  children need to be considered. Echegaray and Hansstein   mentioned that high-income group adequately dispose of e-waste in  appropriate channels in Brazil. However, it is necessary to under - stand why low-income residents are not involved in recycling and  their potential demand for such services, including in other devel - oping countries.   ≡As cheaper products tend to have shorter lifespans, product design  characteristics need to be investigated further. By analyzing samples  across a range of products, a bill of materials  could be  developed, and essential design modifications (cost and quality  efficient products) could be identified by engaging YUSs. Babbitt  et al.  recently applied BoM for collecting disassembly prop- erties of EEE.  ≡Consumers ’ eco-friendly behavior remains until the product pur- chase, but is diminished in the use-phase, and at the EoL phase.  Future research should identify the reasons for such practices  focusing on product design, environmental labeling, and other fac- tors. Echegaray and Hansstein  mentioned that e-waste is not  seen as a recyclable item as compared to other recyclable items such  as paper, plastics, and others. “Why consumers do not consider  e-waste as recyclable items?" is an open research question.   ≡According to Borthakur and Govind  , e-waste-related studies  are now being conducted mostly from natural/applied science dis- ciplines. An interdisciplinary approach is required in understanding  consumers ’ behavior towards e-waste from social science and policy  research areas. A holistic techno-economic perspective (considering  engineering perspective and social changes) needs to develop within  the field of research .   ≡The introduction of internet-based collection systems has created an  integrated cyber-physical space in which EM occurs, with Cao et al.   proposing that block-chain technology could be applied in  transportation and payment in the online e-waste collection system.  This platform can collect data on annual EEE production, sales,  recycling amount of e-waste, and these data can be used as valuable  inputs for future policy formulation. IT is one of the emerging  research areas that requires considerable attention. M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 27≡Regarding online collection systems and formal recycling platforms,  further research is needed into participant perceptions, especially for  low-income and low-education participants. For older people, the  scope, and service innovations required for internet-based recycling  platforms requires further attention. Apart from MPs, there is a  knowledge gap around how consumers dispose of their other e-waste  items in the collection channels. Estimating acceptable collection  prices  also requires further investigation.  ≡Cross-cultural studies are required to understand consumers ’ de- mand for specific e-waste collection options (door-to-door, council  pickup, permanent collection points, online-based system), and the  associated need for incentives. For example, do citizens from China  intend to behave the same when they emigrate to developed coun- tries such as the USA, Australia, or Canada? How do cultural dif- ferences affect e-waste related consumer behavior (e.g., local people  vs. immigrants)?   ≡Few studies were found that had been performed on R&R behavior.  Further investigations are required into consumer perceptions of this  issue and local government policy on the topic (e.g., how local waste  collection authorities engage consumers with repair shops and  charity organizations). Major inhibitors need to be investigated  further from developed countries ’ contexts.   ≡Financing mechanisms for deposit-return systems is a research gap,  that requires further investigation. The mechanism ’s impact on the  online-based collection platforms and retailer-based collection needs  special attention to identify optimal exchange offers for consumers.  MPs and other small IT and equipment require further consideration  in this regard.   ≡According to Wang et al.  , the most critical factors attributed  to using appropriate recovery channels are recycling habits, eco- nomic benefits, the convenience of recycling facilities and services,  and residential conditions. These aspects need to be considered  further for urban areas in developed countries. It is assumed that  most consumers feel reluctant to dispose of e-waste through formal  collection and recycling channels due to the considerable amount of  time involved.   ≡TPB was found to be one of the most widely utilized methods on the  research topic. Future research should pay attention to the large  population size, and source, more representative samples from rural  and urban populations. Face-to-face interviews should be used more  often to understand other consumer behavior dimensions, as this was  performed in only a limited number of studies. In addition, it was  observed that most of the studies applied TPB in the case of recycling  behavior , leaving further op- portunities to assess consumers ’ consumption, reuse, and repair and  storage behavior. In the case of CB, TPB application could observe  connection with recycling intention, especially for products which  are environmentally-friendly or designed under theoretical concepts  such as green phones or green vacuum cleaners. Product-focused  case studies involving TPB are also limited, as it was observed that  recycling and disposal behavior is largely associated with the prod- uct type and category. Solar PV panels will be an emerging e-waste  stream . Various valuable and toxic materials are  present in the panels . In that case, TPB  application would provide a broader understanding of consumers ’  consumption and recycling behavior. Moreover, other constructs (of  TPB) might be considered in consumption-related issues, such as  product design, repairability, availability of recycling-oriented ser- vice  connected with a product purchase,  incentives, and disposal convenience. Nduneseokwu et al.   mentioned that case-specific variable integration, such as situational  factors, psychological factors, and eco-friendly values, could be in- tegrated into an extended TPB model. These factors could be added  by investigating possible interrelations between multiple behaviors  at once, such as storage and repair and reuse. The general TPB  constructs were not assessed for secondhand product purchase, and in the future, researchers should identify the factors associated with  the consumers ’ reuse behavior. For example, do peer-pressure and  social norms affect the R&R behavior? These issues were not  extensively analyzed and need further attention. The impact/influ - ence of TPB application among the participants could be observed  over time (same number of samples after implementing intervention  and observe the change of intentions).   ≡Consumer preferences for retailer-based collection points for e-waste  disposal require further attention. EU WEEE Directive places a spe- cific focus on retailer-based collection . Improving  WMP collection channels and residents ’ environmental awareness is  one of the future research areas .   ≡Computer and IT-related equipment were found as dominant product  categories. Future research should obtain specific data   on lifespan profile that eventually will help estimate EG for each  category within a given region. Urban mining is an essential aspect  that connects with this idea, and policymakers can identify oppor - tunities for improvement in future policy planning from the studies.  6.Conclusion  In this comprehensive literature review article, consumers ’ behav - iors and awareness regarding e-waste were thoroughly reviewed by  analyzing 109 articles published in international peer-reviewed jour- nals. The studies were categorized according to various behavioral as- pects, such as consumption, repair and reuse, storage, disposal, and  recycling. Finally, the article proposed a consumer-centric circular  economy framework that indicates necessary policy initiatives and  business model innovation opportunities towards attaining a circular  economy  in academic research focusing on e-waste.  One of the critical research findings is that consumers are demanding  a substantial change in existing e-waste management systems. Issues  requiring the attention of researchers and policymakers around both  product and service innovation include formal e-waste collection op- tions, data and information security, collection prices, modes of  compensation, service options (online, door-to-door, curbside collec - tion, proximity to permanent recycling centers), confidence and  participation in online recycling platforms, and low-cost repair.  Consumers ’ awareness regarding e-waste should be raised through  education and campaigns. More diversified strategies involving social  media and information provided at physical locations are required to  have an impact on consumers ’ storage and repair and reuse behavior. A  specific focus is required on frequency and content development for  awareness-raising campaigns. Regulatory frameworks require further  attention in relation to informal sector recycling, extended producer  responsibility, payment size and method in take-back systems, public  engagement provision, and mandatory product stewardship schemes. In  developing a national EM policy, regional aspects and city-wide socio - economic diversity should be considered, rather than implementing a  one-size-fits-all solution. To achieve better material circularity, gov- ernment support through tax relief and subsidies should be provided to  local recycling companies and cooperation should be established be- tween electronic product manufacturers and local waste management  authorities.  Manufacturers have a role to play in the product end-of-life stage and  the product design stage to enhance consumer perceptions of convenient  product disassembly  and enhanced repairability. Online  product selling and exchange sites play a critical role in influencing  consumption behavior. In that regard, the government can develop a  national inventory database on  product sales and (sta- tistical) parameter identification for waste generation estimation. Con- sumers ’ selling behavior and its impact on manufacturers ’ reverse  logistics operations should be considered a research opportunity. Ser- vice innovation in e-waste collection for the aged population and the  case of small e-waste items should have a particular focus.  Despite the complex interdisciplinary nature of the research, this M.T. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Journal of Cleaner Production 316  128297 28paper provides an introductory guide to researchers investigating  several issues in one single place. Most importantly, it is often hard to  provide a generalized recommendation linking circular economy prin- ciples  and associated pathways as socio-economic  conditions, policy, and regulation are both country and culture spe- cific. In this case, a more interdisciplinary research approach could be  taken by future researchers in the field.  A global focus on consumer awareness and behavior towards e-waste  has been considered in this review article, collecting, and analyzing  articles published in the international peer-reviewed journals. As the  focus topic encompasses an interdisciplinary field of research, if any  paper missed the WoS database keywords, it might not appear in the  collection and would not have been included in the analysis. Future  research should utilize other keywords and integrating other search  engines such as scholar.google.com. Extending the literature review to  journals in other languages may address some of these gaps, but lan- guage barriers could also create difficulties around researchers learning  from other nations’ experiences.  It is hoped that this paper will have value for policymakers in  developing strategies and for researchers in conducting future research  into the multidimensional research theme of advancing knowledge  around e-waste and circular economy. For future research, an interdis - ciplinary approach is required that seeks to understand the complex  dynamics of consumer behavior including how it varies across different  products and waste streams.
