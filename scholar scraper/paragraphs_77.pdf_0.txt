of large multinationals in e merging economies highlights we identify that mnes look at their products and its packaging in a distinct way we propose that mnes should change their business m odel to include its packaging we advance a framework with incentives using blockc hain and artificial intelligence we developed a resources value loop that adds to th e product life cycle theory we progress the circular economy literature by inte grating it with new technologies abstract earths capacity to sustain mankind is reaching a t ipping point packaging waste is one of the critical problems that is leading to such a situati on and a focus of the un sustainable development goals however large multinational en terprises look at their products and its packaging in a separate way which leads them to th ink that when the product is consumed their responsibility ends leaving the government t o deal with the issue of managing the packaging waste due to the complexity of the issue and the fact that this is particularly problematic in emerging markets we used an indept h and longitudinal case study analysis we found that there were a desire and ability with the use of the right technology among urban groups to tackle the problem if with the righ t incentives to the different involved actors and from a holistic perspective our findings allow ed us to advance a holistic framework based on incentives by using digitalization and new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence doing so we advance the theory in the circular economy by enhancing it with the use of new technologies and advance a resources value loop that adds to the product life cycle theory keywords circular economy packaging waste multinationals digitalization un sustainable development goals emerging economies blockchain artificial intelligence journal preproofpage introduction the united nations un has stated that we have rea ched a tipping point as far as the earths capacity to sustain mankind is concerned united na tions other organizations eg european union national geographic ha ve voiced similar concerns pointing to the fact that the society needs to move away quickl y from certain well entrenched habits a case in point is the way that the society deals wit h packaging waste particularly plastic plastic packaging waste from now on packaging has an adv erse footprint in terms of contributing to climate crisis due to the quantity volume and time that it takes to naturally decompose not surprisingly many eg ipcc united nations refer to packaging waste as one of the major contributors to the current climate crisis however packaging is pervasive in our daily lives as it ena bles us to save food reduce product damage improve shelflife and appearance lower costs and surge convenience thus we ask if packaging waste is a critical and systemic probl em in regard to the climate crisis but at the same time so ubiquitous i n our daily lives what are the fundamental and societal changes required to tackle this issue having this research question in mind the aim of our study is to elucidate on the societal ap proach required to tackle the issue of packaging waste by bringing all the different inter venient into a holistic framework based on an incentives system currently corporations have a mentality of disting uishing between the product and its packaging this in turn leads them to think that when the product is consumed their responsibility ends leaving the government to deal with the issue of managing the packaging waste we therefore see companies exhibiting a d ual or bipolar attitude where they acknowledge and market the complete product as incl usive of its packaging before the sale but completely disown their responsibility by disso ciating the packaging from the product plastic and other slowdecomposing materials journal preproofpage postconsumption however even if this mentality of disowning the packaging waste post consumption is still very much impregnated in the a ctions displayed by corporations consumer expectations regarding the role of corpora tions in dealing with the challenges of climate change in general and packaging waste in p articular are changing societal awareness to waste in oceans and landfills for exa mple is a recent driving force to push for changes united nations images of packaging waste eliminating precious marine species being found inside marine animals destroy ing fragile flora and fauna covering paradisiac beaches or forming towering waste mount ains are having an impact on consumers moreover ngos activists and citizen g roups are demanding that corporations and governments act in order to take appropriate ac tion against the issue of mounting packaging waste recently the guardian rep orted that coca cola nestle pepsi and other large corporations have been sued by a califo rnia environmental group for creating plastic packaging waste at the same time governm ents too are stepping up the pressure on corporations to take ownership of the waste generat ed by their brands by implementing increasingly restrictive laws a case in point is a recent solid waste management law swm in india this law requires corporation s to institute a system to collect back the waste generated by their brands nonetheless and despite these advancements from di fferent stakeholders corporations have a low incentive to change their c urrent practices particularly in low institutionalized countries the apathy of corpora tions to step forward and take charge of implementing appropriate measures has resulted in a statusquo of sorts however this situation can be improved through the use of recent technology advancements we believe that an incentive system along the value chain cov ering the different stakeholders involved might change this situation technology advancement s such as blockchains artificial intelligence ai internet of things iot big da ta robotics amongst others might help to journal preproofpage close the loop and enable a move away from the curr ent linear to a truly circular economy ce on packaging waste since india has the legal framework in place that o bliges corporations to be responsible for their own packaging waste and is on e of the largest emerging economies ees we investigated the packaging waste problem in this setting and how technology is being used indeed ees have been an important par t of the last two decades economic development however increased production and th us consumption and the resulting waste coupled with the institutional voids khanna pale pu that exist in terms of enabling institutional capabilities to cope with the quantum and nature of the packaging waste are the ingredients to a potential world environmental disa ster thus ees are a good starting point to tackle the packaging waste problem however we need to understand that tackling this i ssue is complicated on such resources and capabilities constrained economies b ecause of that our research proposes a defined strategy that focuses on large mnes due to four main reasons the impact that those corporations have on packaging waste on ees their resources and capabilities available worldwide their corporate social resp onsibility and ethics internal strategies and their brand value and how much they have to lose when legitimacy from the different stakeholders is jeopardized thus we focused on t hose corporations and on the understating of how we could align the different stakeholders i ncentives towards a packaging ce so the system makes environmental and social but also eco nomic sense the integrated waste management approach propagated by wilson et al and seadon along with the stakeholder theory adv anced by freeman et al provide the theoretical basis for our framework with our framework we provide a practical approachmodel by showing the role of the various s takeholdersagents who are part of the waste value chain and how they can make a positive difference backed by several benefits journal preproofpage with this article we contribute to the increasing l iterature in ce by bringing it to a still understudied specific phenomenon fast moving con sumers good packaging moreover we bridge ce with new technologies and thus advance o ur knowledge on how new technologies can enhance and leverage ce framework and practices we also contribute to the theoretical discussion of product life cycle by expanding it to a resources value loop as corporations need to integrate their products with its packaging the idea of looking at product and packaging separately needs to be abandoned finall y we advance the participatory theoretical models backed by a framework that demon strate the practical approach that can be taken to apply the principles of ce at the grassroo ts level indeed these models are yet to be conceptualized in the context of ees even though i ts need is paramount from a world sustainability perspective literature review stakeholders theory in the modern business context there has been a tr ansference in objectives of organizations from a focus on profitability of the shareholders a nd the maximization of profits towards the concern of a more global satisfaction of all stakeh olders allowing concepts such as corporate social responsibility csr and ce to develop hav ing that in mind the stakeholder theory friedman argues that the ultimate test for the company would be to successfully satisfy all the demands of the multiple stakeholder s instead of accomplishing conventional economic and financial criteria mitchell et al where stakeholders are any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the ach ievement of the organizations objectives freeman p the stakeholder theory attem pts to balance the added value and benefits that the different stakeholders exchange w ith firms carroll furthermore the acknowledged importance of the wellbeing of the natural and social environment in which the companies are inserted leads them to take a str ategic approach to csr in response to journal preproofpage stakeholder demands vaaland et al theref ore the stakeholder theory defends that the use of a socially responsible strategy to maxim ize business profits is advantageous freeman from a multinational enterprises mnes perspective stakeholder theory needs to be framed from both the firm home and host markets as those firms need to pursue legitimacy also in the hostcountries dimaggio powell hah freeman jamali tan wang subsidiaries of mnes suffer fr om liability of foreignness as host country stakeholders often lack information concern ing the subsidiaries and can use preconceived notions which negatively affect subsi diaries hansen et al campbell et al therefore mnes need to be particularl y careful when operating in foreigner markets and analyze carefully the different stakeho lders and their power dsouza et al mitchell et al however for large m nes frequently coming from developed economies entering into ees means a relaxation of csr and activities chen et al this happens because consumers and other social gro ups are frequently not seen as a strong stakeholder as it happens in developed econo mies figueira et al furthermore the formal institutions in ees are wea k torres de oliveira et al oriaifo et al which allows the mnes to operate wit h less csr consciousness miska et al packaging of their products is an example of an activity that mnes particularly large ones tend to rely on the institutional voids of th e host countries instead of following more stringent policies as frequently happen at home or other developed economies chen et al this also happens because there is the over all perception even among large mnes that present billions of dollars on financial profi ts very year that packaging of their product is out of their responsibility as soon as the product is sold and therefore packaging is someone else responsibility in this research however we bring the mnes to the center of the problem but also to the center of the solution and armed with the stakeholders theory we journal preproofpage felt the necessity to also bring together the other s mnes stakeholders to help tackle this critical problem particularly to ees packaging waste and circular economy bouldings concept of a closed circular earth syste m with finite assimilative capacity and the resulting requirement for an equilibrium between th e environment and the economy boulding was a first attempt to describe wh at we today call ce stahel and reday developed the concept of the loop economy an d supporting efficiency and dematerialization industrial strategies however i t is pearce et al that are often credited with introducing the ce concept as they de scribed the influence of natural resources on the contemporary linear economic system in thi s research we follow the kirchherr et al p comprehensive definition of ce and t he different concepts that summarizes all important aspects of it environmental threats economic challenges and unm et social expectations have resulted in the concept gaining momentum amongst pr actitioners scholars and policymakers geissdoerfer et al the ce is now argued to be one of the most notable sustainable development concepts macarthur as products can be repaired reused upgraded or become a part of a fully recycled system leading t o furthering environmental economic and social goals geissdoerfer et al however many practices are fundamentally entrenche d in firms operations and business models and once established are often diff icult to adjust bocken et al also political obstacles remain difficult to remove due to the strong influence of lobby groups also hindering the introduction of externalities policie s complex international supply chains and large upfront investments are holding companies ba ck from transitioning from a linear to a ce even if we know that ce initiatives had been i ncorporated into the corporate sustainability agenda of large mnes aguilarhernan dez et al we also know that journal preproofpage initiatives addressing consumers are critical for m aking a transition towards ce and those are still largely missing stewart niero ind eed the ce initiatives seem to emphasis on the design of processes and the cycling of material s but frequently remain silence on the social dimension inherent to its applicability and sustainable development qu et al indeed the responsibility not only lies with priva te businesses but also with regulators and policy makers sun et al an d with the consumers and social organizations credible global national and region al consumption targets smart regulation and incentive structures should consider guide and align all stakeholders behavior encourage innovation and investment as well as int ernational governmental and professional cooperation as well as encouraging transformative systematic change rather than incremental efficiency gains korhonen et al furthermo re in the advancement of the ce it is crucial to support ees to avoid further business m odel lockins this is why a holistic view with the different stakeholders involved is require d indeed ce implementation is an example of an organizations decisions being influe nced by stakeholders demands cantrell et al and therefore linked to the stakehol ders theory ce emphasizes the importance of recycling as one of the means to reduce the environmental impact of waste where packaging play s an important role because plastics for example generated from packaging has increased exponentially there have been several calls to tackle the issue namely from european uni on and united nations eygen laner fellner however only some packaging mater ials can be recycled or reused geueke groh muncke for example the applicabil ity of plastic waste for a product needs to be assessed on a case to case basis due to produ ctspecific quality requirements because the chemical composition of some plastic wastes mig ht hold hazardous substances and therefore are undesirably for being circulated dah lbo polaikova myllari sahimaa anderson journal preproofpage most of the research and efforts in the sustainable packaging domain has been conducted in developed economies due to the existen ce of enabling policies meherishi narayana ranjani however ees are today important consumer markets and packing waste generators and where frequently no tr eatment happens therefore tackling the packaging waste in ees is critical from a local and world environmental perspective de la caba et al furthermore to design effective packaging waste po licy initiatives data pertaining to the flows of the packaging is needed however one of the major issues pertaining to recycling and recovery is that most of the recovery efforts focus on the downstream portion or the last mile therefore closing the loop conn ected to packaging waste depends upon a variety of factors and the waste collection system deployed by a municipality should be just one of the factors affecting the overall recycling rates instead of the critical role that todays plays other factors that have a bearing are sorti ng and recycling methods competition between recycled and virgin materials price volati lity of recycled materials waste management policies level of education and partici pation and associated financial incentives tallentire steubing therefore to try to build a circular packaging was te framework some need to look at it from a systemic waste management perspective and acknowledge the necessity of a better packaging design and technology advancements at the sorting and recycling stages rahimi garcia furthermore it is noted that mor e detailed mapping of resource movements along company and sector value chains is required as well as analysis on value creations and economic impact of products and companies which is becoming increasingly possible due to recent technology developments preston song et al indeed today we have a group of technological tools available wang et al that can also enhance the circularity of packaging waste journal preproofpage digitalization enhancing the circular economy often defined as the increase in the use of digital technology digitalization is a process that generates business change using digital capabilitie s torres de oliveira et al this transformation is characterized by four main aspect s the vertical networking of smart production systems horizontal integration thr ough engineering and acceleration through exponential technologies deloitte p fast and strategic utilization of technologies such as the iot fast automated data transaction and collection through a system of inte rconnected digital devices ai data processing augmentation beyond human reasoning vi rtual reality new communication and experience method robotics industrial production enhancing work automation d printing new production method sensors production proces s monitoring method big data data processing and interpretation and blockchain reco rds linked by cryptography for increased transparency amongst others promises increased co mpetitiveness and reduced operational risk peruffo et al it is widely accepted that digitalization will prom ote the ce by enabling more efficient use of fewer resources through the provis ion of accurate information and visibility of resources and products ultimately resulting in the closure of resource loops enabling the utilization of intelligence on not only material av ailability but also its location and condition digitalization helps achieve efficiency gains by mi nimizing transaction costs and waste through the promotion of more durable products ant ikainen et al for example a move to servitization is considered a crucial ce accelerator as it involves the combination of durable physical produc ts with intangible services designed to fulfil customer needs replacing the generation of p rofit through the sale of artefacts with that of cost and material efficient reuse the utilizat ion of digital technologies such as cyber physical systems big data data mining and analysi s iot as well as ai blockchain journal preproofpage technology and smart products have the potential t o allow for improved product design new value creation and the capture of opportunities th at reduce resource use improve material transparency traceability reliability and trust within the global value chain as well as product performance optimization further benefits can be enhancing product innovation better attraction of the target customer segment i mproved technical support provision customer satisfaction ease of collaboration with s takeholders and higher profit through the sale of data lastly maintenance and product upgra des could be better planned and targeted if product use and endoflife activities were opt imized bressanelli et al in short ce requires the careful coordination and optimizati on of the entire value chain fischer pascucci and digital technologies have the p otential to enable decision makers to comprehend vast amounts of data to make effective accurate and sustainable decisions as well as to control information and material flows however past literature pagoropoulos et al tseng et al explained the limited research on the opportunities created by a s well as the challenges hindering digital technologyaided circular business model implementa tion however research does suggest that the main challenges in relation to ce and digi talization are financial benefit measurement structural lack of information excha nge unclear responsibility operational infrastructure supply chain management attitud inal perception of concept and risk willingness to collaborate technological product design operational technology integration and educational competency requireme nts antikainen et al thus further research is required to determine how barri ers can be overcome theoretically and practically un sustainable development goals emerging eco nomies and large multinationals responsibility journal preproofpage the agenda for sustainable development publish ed by the united nations provides a guide for achieving the goals of peace and prosperi ty for our planet united nations at the heart of the blue print are the sustainab le development goals which are the clarion call for all the nations irrespective of their dev elopmental stage to collaborate in developing a partnership in order to pursue economic growth wh ile balancing the issues pertaining to health state of our cities justice pollution eq uality and state of the oceans and earth packaging waste is relevant to at least six of thes e goals goal no clean water sanitation no sustainable cities communities no responsible consumption and production no climate action no life belo w water and no life on land if developed economies already have mechanisms in p lace that will allow them to tackle some of the un goals world health organizat ion the reality in ees is very different george et al indeed most of t he waste increase is expected to come from emerging economies world bank b please ref er to table within the context of emerging economies tackling the waste problem is a bigger challenge in the urban areas since they are the engines of growth duranton but also the agents of change vliet insert table around here because of their economic development countries in asia have attracted large corporations many of which are large mnes please refer to table for example hindustan unilever the indian subsidiary of the co nsumer goods major unilever is expected to become the largest subsidiary for the global gia nt unilever by surpassing the us unit by malviya sriram having an annual es timated growth rate of it is the fastest among all of the unilevers markets the in dian subsidiary is already the largest market for unilever in terms of volume and nearly billion units are produced annually at the companys factories across india and nearly per cent of households in india use one or journal preproofpage more unilever brands similarly proctor and gambl e pg india controls over half the diaper sanitary napkin and shaving razor market in india malviya not surprisingly large mnes are responsible for more than of pac kaging waste in countries like india please refer to table insert table and around here having in mind the importance of urban spaces on ee s and how much large mnes contribute to the packaging waste problem globally we focus this research on how these large mnes can be agents of change or at least par ticipants of change on urban emerging economies settings however due to its complexit y waste requires an integrated approach where governments will also be an important stakeho lder institutional initiatives several governments are making a stance on waste f or example in the european parliament approved a ban on a wideranging list of single use items in addition financial measures such as offering deposit refund programs h ave been encouraged to ensure collection of of singleuse bottles by in india pr ime minister narendra modi is keen to stop the use of single use plastic in india by and has asked businesses to do their part in order to accomplish this goal however it was the indian swm law that crea ted a regulation that puts the onus on the brand owners for collecting their produ cts packing waste or packet for sanitary waste its article reads all manufacturers or brand owners who sell or marke t their products in such packaging material which are non biodegradable shall put in place a system to collect back the packaging waste generate d due to their production and article reads manufacturers or brand owners or marketing companie s of sanitary napkins and diapers shall explore the possibility of using all recyclable materials in their products or they singleuse plastic items including straws cotton swabs and disposable plastic plates and cutlery to be banned by journal preproofpage shall provide a pouch or wrapper for disposal of ea ch napkin or diapers along with the packet of their sanitary products this document also articulates the need for busines s firms communities and ngos to work together with the local municipal authoriti es in order to deal with the large quantum and composition of the municipal solid waste as a part of this integrated approach to managing municipal solid waste producers have to p ut in place a proper mechanism to take back the waste caused by their brands if they want to keep operating under the indian legal framework however due to the institutional voids present in india as in many other emerging economies large mnes are able to dodge this becaus e of the lack of coordination between various local and regional governments an archaic legal system minimal use of technology absence of data and a lack of a legal enforceabili ty system in one of our interviews a municipal commissioner in the government of maharas htra india stated it is more than three years since the solid waste management rules have been notified the regulations require companies to take back their waste but they dont do it we have sent them legal notices but th ey dont bother to respond to them they are not providing pouches for the dispos al of sanitary pads and they just dont care about the consequences the rules d ont specify the deterrents for noncompliance with the solid waste management rule s we have limited powers and believe me there are so many challenges that we have face herewe need to be empowered and the companies need to get the mess age that they cannot just come sell and leave us to clean up the mixed waste thus proper implementation of the policy continues to remain a challenge agarwal et al large mnes on the other hand foll ow a not in my backyard attitude which exacerbates the problem methodology an integrated solid waste management approach adop ts a strategic view by considering the generation segregation transfer sorting treatment recovery and disposa l of waste in an integrated manner with an emphasi s on maximizing efficiency of resource use the role of the central state and local governments in municipal solid wa ste management has been elaborated in the document published by the mi nistry of housing and urban affairs of the governme nt of india journal preproofpage buckley et al expressed the importance of p henomenadriven perspective as a way to address and tackle the big questions and grand chal lenges others stressed how qualitative methods are important for understanding realworld phenomena and for future development but also found that outstanding qualitative researc h in top journals was conducted under single case studies cuervocazurra et al p namely the tomioka paper company brannen peterson and the ikea cas e jonsson foss welch et al explained that case studies can follow different paths due to the problem in hand a phenomenon that is seemingly dif ferent from past theories and the available frameworks in this research we decided t o follow a contextualized explanation bhaskar this method was particularly rele vant for this research as we knew that we would be analyzing a dynamic and complex set of mec hanisms that we wanted to deal with from a holistic perspective thus we followed a de ductive approach by grounding our observations and theorizations on past theoretical frameworks data collection and analysis the topic of this paper is of an exploratory nature concerns a contemporary and novel phenomenon and has the potential for theoretical d evelopment therefore we followed the literature recommendation to employ an indepth lon gitudinal case study approach to gain rich qualitative insights eisenhardt eisenh ardt graebner yin such a qualitative research approach and particula rly longitudinal casestudies design have been advocated for addressing contempo rary or novel phenomena which can challenge previous theories or models eisenhardt eisenhardt graebner ghauri yin particularly because of i ts very nature of being illustrative and explorative with this approach we gained an invalu able opportunity to obtain and interpret rich data and information in order to shed light on underexplored research areas as tracing the experiences of the stakeholders who are part of the packaging waste chain such as journal preproofpage userswaste generators collectors urban governanc e bodies waste dealers startups working in waste management committees of large residentia l societies researchers waste landfill site staff and corporate managers from a secondar y data perspective we also studied the existing policy guidelines large urban residential societies reports and other documents and company reports to understand the mechanisms associ ated with the incentives to the different stakeholders to tackle the packaging waste problem gathering data we started gathering data through semistructured i nterviews easterbysmith et al we selected the number of interviews based on consi derations of theoretical saturation as suggested by glaser and strauss more specif ically we continued our interviews until the explanations and knowledge obtained from additi onal interviewees were very similar to the explanations and knowledge already obtained br yman eisenhardt this process resulted in interviews totalizing almost hours more than video clips and over photographs the interviews wer e conducted from march to june our approach involved interspersing the field work which covered various stakeholders involved in the waste value chain wit h the views of functional business and policy experts from this field please refer to ta bles and insert table and around here interviews were conducted both in hindi marathi a nd english we decided not to edit the interview transcripts eg by correcting any grammatical or languagerelated errors and to use direct quotes when the interviewees resp onded in english to avoid the risk of altering the meaning of their explanations we furt her ensured verbatim translations from hindi and marathi into english in order to keep the meaning of the conveyed explanations in addition to the interviews there were several o bservations conducted by two of the authors on different settings such as the process o f doorstep waste collection in urban journal preproofpage residential societies segregationaggregation of p ackaging waste transport by the municipal authorities to the landfill for further processing among others the authors also spent a large amount of time in scrap sheds understanding and obs erving the waste segregation and sale process and speaking to municipal officials to unde rstand the challenges with regards to waste management implantation apart from this indepth longitudinal work we coll ected secondary data and information through company reports websites urba n residential societies reports news media and reports and publications from the united nations on the sdgs indian regulations among others data analysis the main technique of data analysis used was templa te analysis even to have a methodical structure of the gathered data and information kin g we selected the computerized analysis software nvivo which aided us in analyzin g the complex and large quantity of collected data and information due to the large ab undance of information from our cases we needed the triangulations of primary and secondary data sources as suggested by ghauri to avoiding commonsource biases and anecdo tal accounts given the exploratory nature of the topic we designed our semistructure d interviews in a way to allow ample time for openended questions that aided us in exploring new knowledge and information and incorporating these in subsequent interviews the cases municipal solid waste in india for the purpose of this paper we have chosen to ex plain the answers to our research questions against the backdrop of the waste generat ed in the urban indian household context by particularly looking at large confined residenti al compounds also called residential for example  menu journal preproofpage cooperatives housing societies rchs india is am ong the top countries in the world generating the highest amount of municipal solid wa ste in india alone generated around million tons of solid waste and this numb er is expected to increase to million tons by ministry of environment about of this waste remains untreated sharholy et al and is mostly dum ped into landfills our fieldwork was carried out in the pimple saudaga r area of pune india the city is the second biggest city of the state of maharashtra there are two municipal corporations which are operational in pune namely the pune muni cipal corporation pune corp and the pimpri chinchwad municipal corporation pimpri corp our fieldwork was conducted in the latter area because there are many large housin g society clusters and due to its fast growth that relates to the availability of information tec hnology it jobs this in turn has attracted a large number of educated individuals and led to t he creation of cosmopolitan communities that are relatively more open to experimenting with it prototypes and are savvy with using various mobile applications and tools past literature in the domain of waste management marello helwege zhang et al has highlighted the challenges and th e limitations faced by the administrative machinery and the case of the municipality under s tudy is no different the pimpri corp generates about tons of garbage waste and in spent nearly usd million for distributing garbage bins green and white to arou nd thousand families for segregating the wet and dry garbage more the pimpri c orp has spent close to usd million in waste management for the period this expenditure is expected to go up to usd million for the period following the swm law pimpri corp made it m andatory for their residents to segregate garbage into dry wet hazardous and ele ctronic waste this waste segregation initiative was launched on june which was designated as the world environment journal preproofpage day by the commissioner of the primpri corp area the move was prompted by the fact that pimpri corp slipped to nd position in its swachh bharat ranking in from a municipality perspective they started tackl ing this problem by looking at rchs due to their large number of residents follow ing the government movement and given the magnitude of the problem we decided to i nvestigate rchs within the pimpri corp catchment case study roseland residency cooperative housing society one of the places that pimpri corp picked to launch their waste segregation initiative in was the roseland residency cooperative housing soci ety roseland rchs roseland rchs is among the oldest and biggest residential so cieties in the area there are buildings in the society and it has approximately apart ments which house about residents following the initiative from the local movement t he roseland rchs took several actions first it started garbage segregation and electronic waste management garbage is segregated by the residents into three categories organic recyclable packaging and reject sanitary waste achieving nearly segregatio n at source see figure the segregation and composting efforts have not only he lped the society to earn awards like the prime minister national swacch bharat award but have also enabled the society to sell the compost and generate revenue the compost is primar ily used for gardening second it started a water conservation program by rationing w ater supply during the peak summer months collecting rainwater for harvesting and a conscious ban on using tanker water the main and only source of water supply until was the borewells situated on the campus a third initiative was related to bird feeders the re are bird feeders and water dispensers installed throughout the society this has helped t o revive the declining sparrowbird population fourth the society enhanced a power sa vings scheme by switching to led lights journal preproofpage which helped towards achieving power and carbon red uction targets as a result of the management of the rchs the temperature inside the society is nearly two degrees cooler than outside fifth the society installed a sewage treatment plant the water that is used by the residents is treated and reused for gardening sixth the society installed solar power panels to generate renewable power within the compl ex this will also help them save money in diesel costs for powering the electric generator other initiatives conducted by the roseland rchs we re related to reducing waste for example over the course of the past three year s it created a partnering for social causes initiative where the society organized clothes coll ection for unfavorable communities such as goonj the society also created a material recovery fac ility area where residents are encouraged to dropoff the hard to recycle items su ch as glass broken bulbs and tube lights clothes plastic bottles among others various re cycling companies collect these items for onward processing finally the society tries to b ring the young generations into the waste management problem by creating a childrens army of plastic warriors to collect the plastic waste from households and send it onward for recycl ing see figure as one of the householders said there are a lot of initiatives that our society has undertaken towards environment and social sustainab ility and its really a nice place to live even after nearly years our residential complex is among the cleanest and safest places to live we have revived the sparrow and have got many awards over the years in fact it is easy to sell an apartment in this society because s o many people want to buy an apartment here insert figure and around here case study kunal icon cooperative housing society kunal  journal preproofpage kunal icon cooperative housing society kunal rchs is spread over square meters space and has a total of apartments and houses there are approximately residents in the complex they are located in close proximity to the roseland rchs the push for undertaking segregation of waste was spurred due to the pimpri corp directive to manage waste and from the election of a new management com mittee that was keen to support prime minister modis initiative called swachh bharat ab hiyan the kunal rchs has undertaken similar approaches to sustainable living approach when compared with roseland rchs kunal rchs also used rainwater for harvestin g which helped the society to remain water sufficient from july to november every year a s compared to other residential complexes in the municipality area which have to d epend upon water trucks ferrying water the society also has solar power generation to redu ce the dependence upon the power grid this activity also qualifies for earning credits re quired in order to get a property tax waiver the kunal rchs has also been involved in tree plant ation activity in order to keep the campus verdant even to qualify towards earning poi nts that are reverted in property tax credits a material recovery center was also setup for the purpose of collecting plastic cardboard papers and electronic waste interesti ngly the kunal rchs included a disposable sanitary pads incinerator to prevent soi led sanitary waste from leaving the campus this also prevented waste workers from coming in co ntact with such items and to reduce the possibility of further contamination in this society compost preparation from the food waste and scraps was done in house the food waste wet waste was collected fro m each building and thereafter weighed using a digital scale a shredding machine was used to shred the food scraps into smaller particles and thereafter natural composting techniq ues were used wherein microbial culture along with an assortment of indian herbal plant tre atments was applied to the mixture placed swachh bharat abhiyan clean india mission urban and rural see  fo r the details of the clean india mission urban journal preproofpage in composting pits aerobic process the task of d oorstep collection of food and recyclable waste incineration of soiled sanitary napkins and compost preparation was handled by three different vendors findings based upon our fieldwork on these two residential s ocieties which are similar to many others all over india and after talking to different stak eholders we found some commonalities first we found that there is a desire and ability among communities to find solutions to the mammoth problem of managing waste as the chairper son of the roseland rchs put it we want this to be a great place for people to liv e and raise families therefore we know that it is up to us to keep this place clea n and livable we just have to step out the precincts of our gates to see the cont rast between the cleanliness and hygiene standards that we have maintained in our re sidential complex versus what is available outside we also involve our kids in understanding the need to segregate household waste properly so that this ha bit is imbibed in them right from a very young age this is our country and its our moral and civic duty however these intentions were linked with institut ional support for example it was interesting to realize that instead of reprimand me asurements the municipality decided to incentivize rchs and compounds in waste segregation and other sustainability initiatives namely by introducing tax waivers moreover and in order to encourage community participation in ecofriendly activities particula rly waste segregation the municipality also introduced an innovative program to offer a waiver on the property tax for its residents based upon on several criteria please refer to table insert table around here we also found that monetary incentives such as prop erty tax breaks introduced by the municipalities and presence of other incentives suc h as public recognition among peers helped to secure a buyin and hasten the transiti on from a not my problem to a our community problem as the community started participating in segrega tion to a point where it  ertytaxwaiverforecofriendly societiesarticleshowcms journal preproofpage is segregating nearly of their solid waste fu rthermore we found that the initial stages of building awareness overcoming resistance and co nvincing residents is very tough however the rchs created the waste champions as they knew that attitudinal change is a long process that can result in a lot of friction some of the societys managing committee members explained that it is only after receiving a ccolades and success that things become a bit easier as a committee member said it would helpful to have a forum wherein such work is recognized so as to motivate more waste champion s to come and take the work forward in their respective communities the same managers explained that there are genera lly one or two persons who are spearheading the task of awaren ess building overcoming any resistance and ensuring that the segregation continues on a da ily basis another finding from our field work relates to the various innovations that occur at the grassroots level especially while managing the entire activity on a limited budget and in the midst of a skeptical audience this can be in t he form of design of the structures equipment and processes in both of the above soci eties the group driving the waste segregation initiative had produced design innovati on pertaining to the compost pits marking of sanitary waste rainwater harvesting methods use d and the push carts prepared for collecting the waste at the doorstep level inter esting however is the extent of the usage of social media for publicizing the initiatives taken as it was different between the two residential societies nonetheless with these palpable achievements not everything went smoothly on this transition to a more sustainable residential societ y the indifference regarding the inability of the existing municipal machinery to cope with the v olume of waste namely packaging one and the lack of awareness regarding the harmful eff ects of items such as used sanitary see roseland residency cooperative housing society s website here  and kun al icons waste warriors here  ers journal preproofpage products were challenges moreover marketing the compost made from the food waste was a challenge faced by both residential societies in the absence of suitable sales avenues this resulted in the stockpile of the compost inventory causing space problems the managing committee member who is in charge of the waste mana gement project in kunal rchs said we are meticulous in segregating the food organic waste and preparing compost by following the aerobic method we spend a bout usd per month for offering door step waste collection facility to our residents and our capex cost for constructing the compost pits procuring materi als labor etc for constructing compost pits was about usd in fact our c ompost is of a very good quality but it is difficult to market the same as a result it piles up and occupies a lot of spacemarketing linkages for the compost sho uld be developed our interviews also pointed to the fact that both r chss were interested in partnering with the municipality and commerce companies in con ceptualizingimplementing solutions that involved minimizing waste or enabling efficien t collection of the waste generated by brands in the case of roseland rchs for example they had volunteered to be part of an exercise to test market a new product design for sa nitary napkins and diapers by the leading brand leader in this space the chairperson of the roseland rchs said since we are a community of approximately pe ople we get a lot of packages ordered via the ecommerce websites anothe r contributing factor is that since most of our residents are people working in t he it space they are comfortable in using the internet for their purchas es during promotional events conducted by the ecommerce companies such as mega sales and festival promotional offers we get a lot of packages that a re discarded as waste quite a lot of these packages can be reused but since ther e is no incentive to hold on these packages people just throw them we are will ing to work with ecommerce players in order to contain this waste we can set aside some additional space in our premises for the recovery of the resource such as good sturdy cardboard boxes plastic covers etc which can be reused in one location itself the ecommerce company can get back what would otherwise be treated as waste and convert it into an item that can be used to ser vice the next order and so forth use of technology both the residential societies used a semiautomate d approach for their administration purposes in the case of roseland rchs usage of t echnology has evolved with the passage journal preproofpage of time and increase in the number of residents i n the time period the main medium of communication was the email a gmail grou p was created for information exchange purposes further a facebook page was als o created subsequently a whatsapp group was created and the e mail account was disco ntinued roseland rchs uses the adda software for managing its administrative activ ities external reports to be submitted to government authorities are prepared using a comb ination of ms office tools along with the adda software roseland rchs also has its own webs ite kunal rchs on the other hand uses the tally softw are for its accounting purposes vendor bills are received either via email or throu gh a physical copy and paid by updating the relevant expense head in tally unlike roseland rc hs which does not track its organic waste to compost data kunal rchs maintains daily r ecords of the organic food waste collected from each building as well as the amount of compost harvested every month this data is maintained in excel and detailed records ar e kept of the quantity harvested sold and price sold they also use whatsapp for communicatio n and have created a group on facebook called the kunal icon waste warriors to discuss the concerns and challenges related to waste management in the society kunal r chs also has a website both the residential societies also use you tube for posting videos that highlight their sustainability initiatives and celebrations the managing committee members and the residents of both these rchs are cognizant of the power of the visual medium in spreading the word regarding their work by providing a visual documentation to g overnment officials prospective buyers and corporate sponsors and the media it also see ms that the residents are open to try new things as one of the residents stated there are still many things that we can do to red uce see   iers   andresidency and  icon journal preproofpage the waste generation we are about people so even small steps can make a huge difference our society is always ready to try out new initiatives during the course of the data collection in kunal r chs one of the authors piloted the idea of developing an app for capturing the househo ld related waste segregation pattern and behavior a functional document was prepared after studying the daily waste segregation behavior the application has been conceptualized with the purpose of gathering user level first mile data of which there is a great paucity in the present context availability of the first mile data ie individual user level waste segregation pattern data can help to reward good behavior through appropriate recognition and r eward in a data driven manner discussion packaging waste management is a complex issue in an y setting however packaging waste management in low institutionalized countries such as emerging economies is even more complex due to the institutional voids that are pre sent notwithstanding this some countries such as india have in place laws and regulation th at require and push the agenda for a ce on packaging a case in point is the swm law in india as previously mentioned with this research we start to uncover the black bo x that brands created around the divorce between products and packaging brands and particularly large mnes of fast moving consumer goods need to rethink the way they look at their product as consumers will more and more follow an integrative approach where packaging is part of the product this approach is also in the governments and individual s interest however and due to the resource constraints and ot her limitations the enforceability of such regulations is not effective leaving brand s to operate on a linear economy ferreira et al huysman et al however and hav ing in mind the stakeholders theory and a ce approach combined with some of the features off ered by some emerging technologies we believe that the right systems with the right in centives can help in alleviating the situation journal preproofpage by enabling better tracking higher participation b y the stakeholders better governance of waste and enabling opportunities that can help to harness the efficiency of recycling packaging waste in our framework some of the emer ging technologies like mobile applications geographical information systems gis ai and blockchain act as catalysts to enable the implantation of an incentives stakeholde r approach towards a ce the incentives past literature eg brehmer et al explai ns that apart from conducive policies and governance and product design the other critical e lements of the ce is the ability to have business models that focus on value creation rathe r than booking short term gains to the different shareholders and that incorporate the ext ended producer responsibility guidelines thus a truly integrated approach towards moving to a ce requires participation from all the major stakeholders it is only then that it is poss ible to move towards an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design macarthur to do so more than a system based on penalties which tend to not work on low i nstitutionalized countries torres de oliveira rottig we suggest a business mod el that incentivize the different main stakeholders involved thus an aligned incentives schemes needs to be in place for the primary stakeholders involved large mnes local authorities residentia l societies rchs in our case and individuals therefore we start by explaining the incentives for each of the primary stakeholders as our cases demonstrated individuals and rchs can be easily incentivized by tax relief thus the residents living in large rchs ha ve the incentives to qualify for any incentive programs being administered by the govern ment agencies apart from that residents will want to have cost savings due to bei ng able to purchase refills of various items that are package free benefit from higher visibili ty and potentially quicker sales of their journal preproofpage properties and possible tieups with companies who are interested in partnering for undertaking csr policies which can potentially lea d to financial benefits during our fieldwork we found that our studied rchs apart from the tax incentives emerged as pioneers in adopting sustainability prac tices and got noticed either through social media and other media channels this entailed benef its such as a quick turnover of the residential units put on sale as there was a keen i nterest in buyers to acquire a property in such visionary clusters hence residents found co mmunities like roseland or kunal rchs to have similarity to western initiatives among cit izens to adopt sustainability practices b the spirit of the residents to work together in order t o solve basic needs issues such as availability of drinking water and maintenance of public spaces which meant that most of the residents knew each other and instances of crimes like theft and robbery were virtually absent c these rchs were seen as leaders which brought good wil l these best practices interestingly spurred on many other surrounding rchs that in tur n have resulted in an atmosphere of healthy competition and quicker speed of adoption which is also beneficial to the municipality environment and the population in ge neral if the local government will be losing revenues due to the tax incentives it will be recovering it through lower waste management requir ed and also because informal economy will be reduced namely from waste pickers and wast e collectors urban local bodies spent between usd usd per ton on solid waste manageme nt kumar et al whereas the collection transportation of waste constitutes ap proximately of the total budget allocated for municipal solid waste management sha rholy et al so the potential financial benefits are indeed high the local gove rnments have thus several incentives that range from less waste to management decrease of th e informal economy not being accountable for not enforcing the swm legisl ation among others journal preproofpage however to close the loop it is necessary to inclu de large mnes owners of the most important brands used on emerging economies at the moment their incentive to take care of their packaging is very reduced and almost only eth ical as these corporations take advantage on the lack of the legal enforceability in emerging economies where india is a case in point luo tung as these large mnes are origina lly from developed economies they should understand that their base home country cons umers have high expectation in terms of csr behavior which include packaging waste moreo ver host country consumers namely from emerging economies are also becoming more awa re of the impact of these large mnes and how they are impacting their lands purohit thus large mnes need to rethink and be the agents of change towards close the cycle of waste and even to ensure a sustainable approach in their local business practices and thus to ensure the firms existence in the long run the perception that consumers have of the firms operations and ethical behavior is paramount moore manring and this is in it self the firms main motivation to do what is right and within the legal framework even if such framework is not enforced institutions can use for example their roles as p romoters or detractors of large corporations based on their legal and moral behavio r from a moral perspective researchers stress the need for an increased role of corporatio ns in solving the challenges that affect the society environment and economy eg climate chan ge pollution income disparity a negative message issued from a local or regional go vernment in an emerging economy towards a global mne can easily and quickly spread around the globe with huge impacts on their image reputations and client base the local governments can also incentivize the larg e mnes instead of following a punitive system for example quicker turnaround ti mes and discounts on the renewal fees for state licenses publishing the success stories via the internet and even promoting for free best practices from large mnes furthermore large mnes could start saving financial journal preproofpage resources by applying a packagefree refills approa ch initiatives to opt for packagefree refills can be rewarded based upon the cost of the packaging saved when compared to the actual purchase plus the environment benefit that c an be translated in wellbeing a case in point is soap and shampoos customers can bring the ir own refill containers and avail of a monetary discount if this practice might not be f easible for developed economies the business model literature pointed to how effective small financial benefits and costs are in emerging economies london hart seelos m air in summary the main incentives for the large mnes to adopt a ce approach for their packaging are remain within the legal framework that will become more stringent around the different settings fulfil their sustainabil ity commitments namely in terms of carbon emissions and waste footprint follow their csr framework by doing what is ethical and responsible for the society and the environment follow what their different stakeholders are demanding in terms of packaging and make su re that they do not deceive customers expectations as it seems that is already happening so many things are possible but the companies mn es dont want to think outside the box they will spend millions of indian rupees in a dvertising expenditure but dont want to do anything at the grassrootsall this csr is just a farce because there is nothing that they are doing in cases where there is so much scope to make a difference roseland resident rethinking packaging waste towards a circular e conomy framework using emerging technologies from an institutional perspective current policies are still focused on waste management while in the ce the very idea of waste is conside red redundant waste from one process becomes the input for other products and the produc ts are designed to prevent waste waste management policies and product development policie s become linked to each other resulting in the creation of policies and activitie s that enable circular flows we suggest journal preproofpage closing this policyimplementation gap by means of a ce framework that incorporates a community led data driven approach to facilitate g overnance and establish accountability having that in mind we developed a ce framework th at makes use of emerging technologies namely blockchain mobile application s gis and ai doing so this framework has the intention to promote sustainable communities and close policy gap implementations which is particularly important fo r ees weber our framework shows please refer to figure a mo del wherein some of the emerging technologies have been applied to achieve accuracy efficiency transparency and accountability among the various stakeholders with respect to managing packaging waste an important part of our framework is the tax incen tives in place towards rchs and residents and at the same time the focus on large m nes on taking care of their waste thus our framework was created with a sustainability fun d in mind which is funded by a group of large mnes insert figure around here in order to control the quality of

a traceable and transparent way the data for each household will be updated in a database that can be mounted on a blockchain in ord er to prevent data tampering in our framework the physical waste can be sold to waste dealers and the details can be updated on the same database the physical recon ciliation ie the actual pieces sold versus digital reconciliation which represents the quantities updated via the mobile app can be used for verification it is possible to do an audit of the physical and digital categories conducting a physical waste audit can also be anoth er method of cross checking the data and its veracity using the features of the blockchain technology it is possible to track the onward journey of the packaging waste to ensure that it i s disposed of in a suitable manner and not discarded in an unscientific manner this ability t o track the entire journey of the waste right from the first mile point of creation to the poin t of disposal last mile is possible due to the power of an integrated approach involving all stake holders the access to the audit trail of the transactions c an enable various stakeholders to verify the authenticity based upon the quantum of recyclable waste processed and managed inhouse by large rchs a daily update of the funds due to them by the manufacturersbrand journal preproofpage owners can be available physical funds

items can be charged to a suspense account every brand ownermanufacturer should be required t o contribute to the sustainability fund in proportion to their market share and a smal ler fee into a suspense account the existence of a separate suspense account will also help to isolate and track such cases in detail this data based approach can also encourage corpora tions to think of integrating principles of ce approach in their business strateg ies as they may find it more profitable to manufacture products that last longer offer repair and refurbishing services to extend the life of some of their products or consider package free options like refills of certain items the thick arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of fu nds while the thin arrows indicate the process flows the

preproofpage to keep traceability for the purpose of explaining the mechanics of the operation of a sustainability fund we have used the data from a r ecent waste audit report published by gaia this waste audit exercise was undertaken in across cities of india volunteers collected different packaging was te items to gather evidence about the situation at the grassroots level this is presente d in tables insert table around here having an arrangement wherein waste pickers are abl e to collect and segregate the waste within the precinctsin close vicinity of a l arge residential cluster such as rchs can help them earn a livelihood that is based on a fair wage and work in relatively good working conditions this approach can also help the waste w orkers get a fair compensation for their efforts and earn their livelihoods in a suitable se tting instead of operating from the roadside makeshift segregation points located in unsafe are asspaces from where they operate to escape harassment and abuse furthermore local authorities can create digital o pen source solutions to promote the sharing of the principles of ce via a web map the idea is to use this web map as a means of communication to help in transmitting the best prac tices and aid in monitoring the sustainability practices being followed by differen t clusters by publishing a sustainability index different clusters based upon their effort s over a period of time can have different indices that can be shown in different colors whic h incentivize a healthy competition the key is to use technology as a medium for motivating proactive behavior in a transparent manner another option is to use community gis plat forms using spatial data infrastructure conclusions and implications apart from the implications to practice and policie s our research advances theory in three main ways first we brought the ce framework to a still understudied specific phenomenon  journal preproofpage fast moving consumer goods packaging this is par ticularly important due to the paramount problem that plastic wasting has in the world unit ed nations second we advance the ce by integrating it with new technologies and thus advance our knowledge on how new technologies can enhance and leverage ce framework and practices if past research started to uncover how new technologies might be used on a ce framework eg bressanelli et al heyes et al our manuscript gives spe cific application on how this can be used in practice finally we contribute to the theoreti cal discussion of product life cycle klepper by expanding it to a resources value loop up to now the literature on product life cycle focused on the tangible asset that is consume d terzi et al however we challenge this premise as the packaging and its was te can have at least a similar impact on consumers when compared to the products such impac t has the potential to impact a firms financial sustainability in the long term which re quires the firm to change its business model to accommodate the packaging and its treatment by advancing a participatory theoretical model backed by a framework that demonstrate the pr actical approach that can be taken to apply the principles of ce at the grassroots level we conceptualize how a resources value loop can exist limitations and future research as with any other this research has several limita tions a main limitation of our work is its settings our approach is particularly relevant to ees where large mnes have a large impact on packaging waste and where large residential soci etiescompounds exist all of these conditions are not always present and thus our fram ework has associated boundary conditions however it seems that large ees follo w similar situations to the ones that we studied which allows us to think that our framewor k has the potential to impact a large percentage of packaging waste journal preproofpage on the other hand this research opens several aven ues for future research a topic related with products packaging relates to the pack aging of online purchases future studies can try to unpack how webcommerce can follow a ce as one of the roseland residents said there is so much unnecessary packaging waste that is a part of any online order from the popular ecommerce stores like say amazon flipk art myntra or other such similar sites i mean even if i order a garment it is wrapped again in bubble wrap there is a cardboard box plastic air pillows for one such item which is not even going to break why do we need all this extra packaging i mean think about it for c lothes bed sheets sports shoes belts bags combs books etc there are so many more items tha t we can think of where we dont need all this extra packaging the government needs to f ine these folks so much unnecessary packaging cost transport cost why what is jeff b ezos thinking another topic that our research uncovered relates t o the use of new technologies even if we used some of the recent advances in terms of new technologies there are many other technologies that have the potential to be used and thus open new avenues of research a case in point is augmented reality or the iot which mig ht have the potential to overcome some of the current limitations journal preproofpage
