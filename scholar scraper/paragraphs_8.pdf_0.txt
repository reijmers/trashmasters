for a transition to a circular economy to recover value from waste however its implementation in china hasfaced many dif culties which are primarily inherent in the public s behaviour towards source separation of household waste based on multiple cases of innovative use of the internet of things iot technologies in china in recent years this study establishes the concept of iotenabled accountability in householdwaste source separation by utilising the lens of accountability theory moreover this research advances several propositions on the multiple dimensions of accountability

the growing literatureon smart waste management elsevier ltd all rights reserved introduction household waste management hwm has been a major chal lenge for governments across developing countries population growth rapid urbanisation economic development and rising standards of living in cities have greatly increased solid waste generation across the globe minghua et al especially in urban areas xu et al these trends pose challenges partic ularly for environmental protection and sustainable development a possible solution to overcome the challenges is to adopt a sus tainable hwm system in line with the cleaner production cp concept and circular economy ce philosophy cp approaches aim to contribute to sustainable development by means of increased production ef ciencies improved environmental managementand sustainable societal development hens et al the cp approaches are key to achieving the ce vision in which waste is considered a resource for value recovery veleva et al farooque et al b both cp and ce have received increasing worldwide attention and feature prominently in chinese and eu ropean governmental policies mcdowall et al hens et al farooque et al b in the context of sustainable hwm source separation by the person who disposes of the rubbish has been widely accepted as an ethical behaviour xu et al and best practice for reducing reusing and recycling waste karim ghani et al zhang and wen b yuan et al previous research has analysed and compared various collection systems for sourceseparated household waste in many developed countries such as japan matsumoto sweden dahl cen et al and spain gallardo et al relevant studies in china have sug gested that source separation makes recycling more ef cient eg better quality compost and recyclables zhang

municipal solid waste msw wang y et al has been encouraging source sepa ration of household solid waste approximately of msw through policy instruments and directives zhang and wen b in the past two decades several source separation pilot projects have been carried out in a number of chinese cities however most of these projects have failed except for some very recent projects where accountability mechanisms were integrated through the use of internetofthings iot technologies xu the extant literature has primarily focused on identifying the factors inhibiting the successful implementation of the earlier pilot projects zhang and wen b zeng et al xiao et al instead of understanding the reasons for success in the most recent pilot projects on the other hand knickmeyer argues that suc cessful implementation of source separation projects require a deeper understanding of public household behaviours and atti tudes towards ethical approaches to waste separation xu et al a number of studies have attempted to identify the ante cedents wang z et al inuencing factors zhang et al and key determinants xu et al of waste sorting be haviours at the individual and household levels however the behavioural aspects of accountability and ethics has been largely overlooked while there are many ways to establish accountability mecha nisms in a given setting in recent years the application of iot technologies has received growing attention boos et al despite some implementation barriers the use of smart enabling technologies including iot in waste management has been iden tied as one of the pathways towards a ce zhang et al in this regard iot technologies can offer dual bene ts they facilitate the establishment of an accountability mechanism and they can also support the transition towards smart waste management for a ce no prior research exists as far as the authors of this paper know that links household waste source separation hwss with accountability and iot technologies this study aims to conceptualise iotenabled accountability in hwss inspired by the recent success of implementing iot tech nologies in several hwm projects in china this study addresses a key question how do iot technologies enable accountability in hwss this paper focuses on residential everyday household waste in typical residential communities in chinese cities where many families live in apartment buildings managed by an estate man agement organisation the following research objectives drive this paper ro to establish the concept of iotenabled accountability in hwss ro to develop theoretical propositions on the multiple di mensions of iotenabled accountability mechanisms in hwss this paper adopts a case study approach to answer the research question and to achieve the research objectives it presents four cases from different parts of china to establish the concept of iot enabled accountability in hwss by utilising the lens of accountability theory this study is a major departure from the prior liter ature which has utilised various behavioural theory lenses such as the theory of planned behaviour to predict and explain behaviour required for source separation of household waste rather than focusing on ways of shaping this behaviour by drawing on the multiple dimensions of accountability as a mechanism this research advances several propositions to provide speci c answers to the how type of research question from different perspectives in addition to offering new theoretical contributions to theliterature on source separation this paper makes important prac tical contributions by identifying appropriate solutions to chal lenging hwm problems that occur in china and in other countries it also provides insights to researchers and policymakers on how to overcome the behavioural challenges in source separation for sustainable hwm through the innovative use of iot technologies the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section reviews the relevant literature section presents the research method and case data section conducts case analyses and pro poses several propositions on iotenabled accountability section discusses the research and practical implications before section concludes the research literature review accountability theory accountability theory explains how the perceived need to justify one s behaviours to another party that has the authority to administer rewards or punishments causes one to consider and feel accountable for the process by which decisions and judgmentshave been reached tetlock vance et al as a result the likelihood that one will think deeply and systematically about one s procedural behaviours increases signi cantly vance et al according to vance et al accountability theory proposes four major dimensions of accountability mechanisms identi ability expectation of evaluation awareness of monitoring and social presence identi ability is the individual sknowledge that his outputs could be linked to him williams et al p hence individuals modify their behaviours if they believe their identity might be revealed in the process reicher and levine expectation of evaluation is the belief that one sperfor mance will be assessed by another party according to some normative ground rules and with some implied consequences lerner and tetlock p this expectation increases so cially desirable behaviours in individuals lerner and tetlock hochwarter et al monitoring is the process of watching or tracking an individual user s activities grifth an aware ness of monitoring fosters the expectation of evaluation vance et al social presence is the awareness of other users in the system walther it is widely accepted that individuals exhibit increased conformist behaviour in the presence of another person even when that person is not directly present and cannot be observed bond and titus according to ferris et al the source of accountability may be internal or external to the actor when individuals perceive internal accountability the obligation to perform certain behav iours is caused by the actor s own commitment to the behaviour hence no formal control mechanism is required and rather in dividuals act out of a sense of personal control dose and klimoski conversely under external accountability actors feel responsible and obligated to perform certain behaviours because they are expected to do so by others thus an external controlsystem would be required to satisfy the accountability demands erdogan et al merchant and otley boos et al insights from control theories suggest that human actors can only be held accountable if they can understand predict and in uence work processes grote in the case of perceived in ternal accountability theories suggest that actors should only be held accountable for outcomes if they had the freedom to choose between two or more alternatives and to act in a chosen manner boos et al in this way individuals feel that they have enough control over the situation to achieve the end results dose and klimoski in cases of perceived external accountabilityb wang m farooque ry zhong et al journal of cleaner production however the expectations must be appropriately structured and explicitly communicated prior to the performance period for actors to assume responsibility dose and klimoski merchant and otley during the performance period the evaluators monitor reports of what the individuals were being held account able for mitchell argues that for accountability to have an inuence on behaviour there is a need to associate a reward or punishment system based on the individual s performance this would make the evaluation process more meaningful to the actors thus behaviour results from control mechanisms including perceived accountability beu and buckley accountability and iot technologies when accountability is used for monitoring and evaluation purposes iot technologies are considered to be key enablers of the control capabilities of the actor demanding the accountability winthereik et al bose et al boos et al the iot refers to an integrated network of physical objects that are equip ped with electronics software sensors actuators and connectivity functionalities so that they are able to connect and exchange dataatzori et al iot technologies can generate large amounts of granular and accurate realtime data automatically brous et al which is very important in the accountability process for example automatic identi cation and data capture aidc tech nology one of the key elements in iot is able to automatically identify objects without human involvement in order to collect data stojkoska and trivodaliev iot technologies make certain aspects of the work process which previously may have been considered to be inaccessible and opaque visible and available for analysis for example big data powered by iot tech nologies eg sensors and devices coupled with supply chain an alytics can be used to discover new insights for better and faster decisionmaking based on data that was previously inaccessible or unusable zhang et al in principle this characteristic of iot technologies is wellaligned with the accountability mechanism which attempts to make the invisible visible munro how ever it is important to evaluate the iot application used for accountability in the rst instance as the extent of control depends on the capacities of the technology in use boos et al accountability and household waste source separation source separation of household waste is considered an effective method for enhancing recycling and minimising waste chung and poon according to gu et al the recyclable compo nent of household solid waste may reach up to hence increased levels of householdlevel source separation can facilitate the transition towards ce given their huge potential in achieving sustainable development many developed countries use system atic and integrated waste source separation programs xu et al however low recycling rates of household solid waste have been observed and reported in the extant literature fan et al for example the crosscountry report of msw in euro pean countries indicates that eight member countries achieved a recycling rate of less than eleven countries recycle between and seven countries between and and only six countries achieve material recycling levels that are higher than european environment agency similarly the recycling rate in the united states is equivalent to united states environmental protection agency until now most efforts both academic and practical to improve sourceseparated collection rate can be classi ed into two main streams the rst stream has been focused on exploring charac teristics of an effective hwss program including strategiesmethods practices and impact assessments see for example bernstad et al rousta et al eriksen et al pedersen and manhice the second stream has been focused on understanding the behavioural factors affecting household waste separation at source including public assessing public awareness opinion and attitudes see for example sekito et al bernstad parizeau et al xiao et al however technology deployment for example iot applications for improving sourceseparated collection rate as evident from the recent successful pilot projects has not been reported in the aca demic literature it is also argued that household waste separation at source requires considerable behavioural change and effort from individual households karim ghani et al this is dif cult to achieve in the absence of a reliable accountability mechanism the accountability concept has a widespread application across various disciplines including environmental and social issues that involve multiple stakeholders tomasini rolando parmigiani et al spence and rinaldi zakaria suggests that stakeholder engagement has a great potential to in uence accountability in complex systems as a major subset of municipal solid waste management hwm is a truly complex system withsignicant environmental and social impacts it involves multiple stakeholders including governments enterprises non governmental organisations waste collectors residents and so on xu et al therefore stakeholder engagement and inter action with an effective accountability mechanism become extremely important for the success of hwm source separation projects iot applications in ce and waste management in transitioning to a ce iot technologies can facilitate the management of restorative and regenerative resource ows iot is able to help with the collection of data generated from various sensors such as smart meters so that stakeholders across the value chain can be connected pagoropoulos et al iot not only provides realtime data it re ects the consequences of particular actions by stakeholders thus ce models based on iotcaptured data may be established for evaluation throughout the lifecycle of certain products such as smartphones alcayaga et al recently researchers and practitioners refer to the concept of a smart ce which is enabled by key technologies such as iot kristoffersen et al presented a smart circular strategies framework for manufacturing companies using iot which is used for aligning activities across the ce and information systems its capacity for data collection has led to the wide usage of iot for supporting the ce in terms of system development and imple mentation lin et al rajput and singh some reallife cases of adopting iot in ce for sustainability have been reported for example fatimah et al introduced an advanced technology like an iotbased sustainable ce method from indonesia for a smart waste management system iot technology has also been used in waste management hong et al medvedev et al anagnostopoulos et al to achieve sustainability in smart cities alturjman et al arguably the information collection ef ciencies and high levels of data sharing that has been achieved through iot technology has made feasible datadriven decisionmaking models gonz calezbriones et al proposed an agentbased iot platform to encourage citi zen participation in recycling tasks through gami cation mecha nisms the work was mainly motivated by the lack of a common method of waste management in the european union similarly heat wave mitigation in m cetropole de lyon reported by robert et al is a recent example of an iotenabled smart city this example is based on the european union horizon b wang m farooque ry zhong et al journal of cleaner production program aiming to improve the interoperability between a number of system components kang et al discussed the applica bility of an iotenabled smart collection system to manage house hold ewaste in the malaysian ewaste recycling sector this system improves the ef ciency and effectiveness of household waste management in terms of saving time and maximising the uti lisation of equipment such as trucks centenaro et al introduced some iot scenarios for typical smart city applications in terms of ef ciency effectiveness and architectural design hong et al presented an iotenabled smart garbage system piloted in seoul the republic of korea for ef cient food waste management the system was capable of exchanging the iot captured data using wireless mesh networks and the data could be analysed for service provisioning anagnostopoulos et al discussed the challenges and opportunities of waste management in the iotenabled smart cities based on a survey study in the city of st petersburg russia they focused on iotenabled smart devices and proposed a novel framework for waste management wen et al presented a case study of an iot network system for restaurant food waste management in suzhou china this system has been running for some years and has achieved signi cant benets including a increase in food waste collection research gaps a thorough review of the literature suggests that iotenabled accountability for sustainable hwss is an emerging research topic the following research gaps were identi ed which moti vated the authors to conduct this research in the extant literature hwss is highly regarded as an effective method for recovering value from waste ows and facilitating the transition towards a ce despite an abundance of research on hwss the low rate of hwss is a commonly reported issue in many countries including china which is the context of the current study evidence from very recent pilot projects suggests that technology deployment ie iot applications has played a signicant role in improving the sourceseparated collection rate however such cases have not been reported in the aca demic literature most of the research efforts to date have been put into pre dicting and explaining the behaviour required for source sepa ration of household waste invariably the questions such as what shapes an ethical hwss behaviour and how does technology deployment shape an ethical hwss behaviour remain unexplored the majority of the source separation pilot projects carried out in several chinese cities in the last decade or so have failed to be effective except for some very recent projects where account ability mechanisms were integrated through iot technologies however iot technologies role in enabling accountability in hwss remains unclear in the literature research method and data fig outlines the methodological procedures of the research this study adopts a qualitative research approach using multiple case studies for two reasons first there is scant research exploring iotenabled accountability in hwss although iot technologies and accountability have been studied separately in focusing on how iot technologies enable accountability in hwss in china this study aims to contextualise interpret and understand the innermechanism through inductive reasoning in order to generate a new theory yilmaz qualitative research methods such as mul tiple case studies are appropriate for this underinvestigated topic as case studies can present data of reallife situations and provide better insights into the detailed behaviour of the subjects of in terest zainal p second hwss has emerged as a major challenge for many countries across the world including developed countries such as japan germany and the united states since china has attempted to implement hwss systems but most of the pilot projects had achieved poor results zhang et al except for some trials of iot smart hwss systems in the last four years given the limited evidence of successful hwss projects in china to date there is a need to adopt a more exploratory approach for which a qualitative method is more suitable following the replication methodological logic multiple case studies can either predict similar case results to strengthen the emerging theory or generate contrasting results to extend theory yin as advised by eisenhardt the researchers selected four cases which were suf cient for generalising empirical ndings while avoiding the data complexity resulting from too many cases case selection case selection was purposive and theoretically directed strauss and corbin based on the following criteria the geographic setting considering china has a vast territory cases were selected to represent major areas including the east coast case a the capital city in the northern area case b the western area case c and the southern area case d successful out comes the researchers selected cases which have successfully strengthened accountability the system had to be in practice for a minimum of three years table summarises the main char acteristics of the four cases pro les of each case are provided below case a in a source separation project started in the huachuan residential community ningbo despite source separa tion promotion and education campaigns a breakthrough in changing the residents waste disposal behaviours did not occur until iot technology

successfully case c an iotenabled smart recycling system called panda has been on trial in a residential community in chengdu sichuan since november the panda has three application layers the frontend layer the middle layer and the backend layer the front end layer enables residents to use a smartphone to scan a barcode on the recycling station for disposing sorted waste residents can get cash rewards based on the correctness of waste sorting and the weight of sorted waste the middle layer coordinates garbage collection and transportation activities the backend layer consolidates and centralises the further processing of sorted waste to recover value the whole system can help residents to sort garbage based on material ie paper plastics metal and clothing and it also customises collection projects based on the demand and ar ranges pickups from home the innovativeness and intelligence of the system have been well recognised by the residents the local street neighbourhood committees have been coordinating and supporting the project case d since august luohu shenzhen city has deployed smart iot machines in residential communities before disposing household waste a resident needs to verify their identity by using smartphone to scan a d barcode on the machine a non smartphone user can scan hisher lowcarbon card from the system to verify their identity then the machine will open its collection door the smart equipment can recognise the waste type glass metal plastics paper textile kitchen waste and other and weigh the waste and reward the compliant resident with credits the credits earned can be used for shopping in the local markets and can even be withdrawn as cash from local banks the system runs on a cloudbased platform it can monitor whether the iot collec tion containers have been fully loaded or not the fully loaded iot containers can automatically send signals to the control centre for arranging timely collection it can also improve route management by tracking how trucks collect the waste from stations data collection validation and analysis this research uses secondary data secondary data has its dis advantages because it has been collected by others for different purposes but for the context of this study it offers relevant infor mation to address the research questions posed and it enables a means of understanding and explaining the research problem at hand ghauri and gronhaug the objective of exploring how iot technologies enable accountability in hwss is served by the data drawn from over ten reliable sources for each case see the accompanying supplementary data the collected data elaborate the entire process ow and illustrate how iot systems can compel the accountability of residents and collectors in hwss the data also show how stakeholders such as the government and its respective organisations help to train educate reeducate reward andor punish to enforce the accountability of residents in iot hwss systems validity and reliability tests have also been performed in this study in terms of constructive validity multiple sources ofevidence were applied to triangulate the data including webpages describing the iot systems and of governmental and semi governmental organisations in addition to catalogues and maga zines articles ghauri and gronhaug the draft report was also reviewed by four researchers internal validity was enhanced through a clear research framework refer to fig dis cussing the ndings among the researchers triangulating to conrm the emerging ndings and re ning the theoretical orientation of the research external validity is improved by rationale for the case selection refer to details of the case study context the case study being guided by the accountability theory refer to section and comparing across the four case studies the development of the case study database refer to the accompanying supplementary data also serves to enhance the reliability of this study sndings the data coding and analysis proceeded through two main phases firstly the researchers searched more than ten secondary data sources for each case and scrutinised them to identify the conceptual themes that emerged then the researchers with chi nese and english language skills analysed the descriptive tran scripts and coded for conceptual content on the identi ed themes including accountability reward and punishment data analysis was an iterative process between reviewing theoretical concepts and identifying patterns in the case data finally the results were analysed and synthesised into case ndings case analysis and research propositions the four iot hwss cases ad have been analysed and fig provides an overview how the six resulting propositions have been induced and synthesised into a theoretical framework the framework integrates multiple dimensions of iotenabled accountability and depicts the relationships between the account ability dimensions the detail of the induction is described as follows although the four cases ad differ from each other in their location sample populations history and the technologies used there are some commonalities which can be drawn for an accountability related study refer to table the four cases involve different levels and complexities of technology usage however all of these cases share a common denominator the necessity of education and monitoring from governmental workers and volunteers to implement iot hwss systems since iot hwss systems are new in their philosophy design processing and administration residents need to become familiar with the system they are required to use residents are compelled to change their old habits and to form new habits in using the iot hwss system education and reeducation can help residents to become familiar with the disposal processes of the new fig theoretical framework of iotenabled accountabilityb wang m farooque ry zhong et al journal of cleaner production system and to correct wrong behaviour meanwhile monitoring can affect past behaviour attitudes normative beliefs and perceived control webb et al from an accountability the ory perspective vance et al the identi ability factor could encourage residents to better educate themselves about the new iot system and related administration the monitoring from stakeholders can foster the expectation of evaluation and related social presence to modify the residents disposal behaviour therefore education and monitoring are the necessary pre conditions for using iot to establish accountability thus the following proposition is proposed p education and monitoring of residents are preconditions for iotenabled accountability in household waste source separation hwss the success of hwss depends greatly on its two responsible stakeholders residents who dispose waste and collectors who transit the waste at the front end since the traditional hwss system has its innate imperfections with preseparation collector bins the system s capacity to succeed relies heavily on residents accountability to put the waste into the right bins waste that is incorrectly sorted may be the result of certain behaviourrelated attributes such as carelessness ignorance lack of education etc moreover a lack of effective onsite supervision and administrative systems to incentivise the desired behaviours also undermine at tempts to hold residents accountable which leads to the poor levels of performance reported a case study of suzhou china indicatedthat of the respondents thought they knew how to source separate waste but only of them actually sourceseparated waste accurately zhang and wen b a system enabled by iot technologies however can avoid such aws with iotenabled hwss the resident needs to scan their family idrelated barcode or qr code to open the correct bin in order to dispose of the waste in this way the iot system can easily link the residents identities with their waste disposal behaviours thus improving their identi ability williams et al which according to accountability theory reicher and levine shapes their behaviour the iot system can immediately detect if the waste has been disposed of accurately also it simultaneously records the disposal data such as disposal time weight category accuracy as well as the corresponding reward or credit all infor mation can be checked at the iot hwss online system by residents using devices such as smartphones and computers meanwhile the internal motivation of residents to sort waste can be reinforced by a reward system the correct separation behaviour can gain credits as a bonus consequently a reward system can train and educate residents to improve their awareness of expectations of evaluation vance et al and commitment ferris et al with the passage of time residents waste disposal behaviour can be changed and their accountability can be strengthened this leads to the following proposition p iot systems can enable residents accountability in hwss by changing their waste disposal behaviour the other key entity in a hwss system is the waste collection stations collectors in the traditional hwss system the collectors receive the discarded waste at temporary depots and passively waitfor instructions or orders from the waste management company to empty the bins and redirect the waste for appropriate treatment since this traditional hwss system was designed based on atable comparison of the selected cases commonalities implement local government regulations on the management of domestic wastes train residents to improve the awareness of the signi cance of garbage sorting and to cultivate the habit of waste sorting educate and reeducate the noncompliant users based on sample

wang m farooque ry zhong et al journal of cleaner production stationary concept that is to collect waste in a preset geographic area at a preset time it lacks the exibility to deposit and clear the waste on time meanwhile the collectors capacity remains underutilised or at other times insuf cient to meet the actual hwss requirement in the clearance cycle since the amount of waste pro duced is signi cantly affected by many factors such as seasons weather festivals parties holidays etc the traditional system suf fers from low ef ciency poor performance delayed operation and or underoptimisation to arti cially maintain the hwss account ability levels the collectors bins in some communities are even locked when administrative supervision is not available the iotenabled hwss system however has been designed to have the dynamic ability to detect the realtime ll level informa tion of rubbish bins and to notify the backend waste management company to clear the bins in time the backend operations can also analyse each collector s information and optimise the collection and transport capacity in the whole area with the realtime data and monitoring mechanism provided by the iot systems the col lectors have no excuse of not achieving a high level of exibility and efciency in their waste collection operations according to accountability theory such visibility in the operations enhances theexpectation of evaluation which in turn increases the collectors accountability boos et al therefore the following propo sition is proposed p iot systems can augment the collectors accountability in hwss by providing realtime visibility in their operations the accountability of the residents and the accountability of the collectors interact with each other firstly the residents account ability is the prerequisite for the collectors to achieve their accountability if the residents do not feel accountable in correctly sorting their waste the collectors will not be able to realise their accountability regardless of how advanced and smart the systems are indeed there have been cases of residents whose lack of accountability have directly impacted on the collectors account ability for example many rubbish bins are burnt in china each year due to irresponsible disposals of cigarette butts the collectors however can also be regarded as a type of external source of accountability for the residents ferris et al the account ability of the collectors is the necessary condition for the residents to achieve their accountability as it prompts residents to feel comfortable and con dent that they can control the waste disposal results dose and klimoski given an increase in the expec tation of evaluation and social presence to satisfy their demands of accountability boos et al the success of hwss systems relies on the positive interactions between residents and collectors and their respective account abilities while traditional systems fail to achieve this interaction because of their limitations in system design iot hwss systems are able to promote the interaction based on their inherent smart systems when residents discard the waste into collectors bins iot hwss systems can detect the accuracy of the sorting from the residents iot hwss systems can also measure the realtime situ ation of the ll rate of collectors bins that is when the bins full warning is triggered and sent to the control centre the centre will assign the waste clearing team to empty the bins in a timely manner thus residents can dispose of their waste without anylimitations related to time of disposal or bins capacity in fact the less internal accountability is present in the residents the greater the need to use external accountability which can be effectively enabled by iot based on the above discussion the following proposition is proposedp iot systems can lead to positive interactions between the residents accountability and the collectors accountability nearly all the residents understand the importance and signif icance of hwss to the environment but this does not necessarily translate to their correct separation and disposal of waste since good intentions may be forgotten verplanken and faes since habits are forms of goaldirected automatic behaviour aarts and dijksterhuis the waste disposal habits of residents can be changed to achieve certain goals behaviour is the reaction of stimulation from the external environment weiner gneezy et al if the result from the incentive is bene cial to oneself the behaviour will be strengthened and repeated if not the behaviour will fail to be sustained although punishment can pre vent the enactment of undesirable behaviours it cannot encourage desired behaviours and can instil resistance and boredom in the punished trevino rewards however can increase one s intrinsic motivation and sense of selfdetermination depending on what is required of one to perform eisenberger et al reward and punishment incentives however can only work when there is support from all stakeholders in this case the gov ernment local council bodies the community and the residentialcommittee this is because reward incentives need strong nancial support from the government for example shenzhen spends more than million rmb in rewards each year equally punishment mechanisms can only work when the system is supervised and implemented by all the stakeholders involved reward and punishment incentives are less effective if they operate in isolation a successful system normally involves both dimensions to simultaneously reward appropriate and punish inappropriate behaviour litzky et al if the lens of accountability theory is applied here the moulding of desired be haviours by residents can be explained in the following way pos itive and negative incentives instil recognition in residents that their disposal behaviour has consequences williams et al residents expectations of having their disposal behaviour contin ually evaluated are raised and normalised lerner and tetlock and nally the desired behaviour is reinforced through the perceived social presence of others bond and titus indeed the four cases ad examined in this study proves that a combination of reward and punishment systems in iotenabled accountability is more effective for motivating the public to participate in source separation of household waste and to form correct behaviour especially in the early stages one testimony is as follows the close combination of the rules and reward incentives is a highlight of our waste sorting work in luohu district and it is also a magic weapon for us to achieve the goal of waste sorting work wenzhi lin deputy director of luohu district urban manage ment bureau case d once residents acquire the desired behaviour of correctly sort ing waste incentives may play a less signi cant role but can still reinforce the desired behaviour therefore the following proposi tion is advanced piotenabled accountability can be most effective by applying both positive and negative incentives in the early stage imple mentation incentives however may be gradually phased out once residents have formed the habit of sorting rubbish the accountability of the residents however may weaken if  nov reporter yahua sun nov reporter yahua sunb wang m farooque ry zhong et al journal of cleaner production they were to perceive a reduction in the system s capacity to identify users or if the level of ongoing scrutiny that they have come to expect is somehow lessened over time vance et al the continuation of an accountability mechanism to shape and sustain desired behaviours relies on the collaboration of all stake holders including administrative supervision from the national government city council community nongovernmental organi sations media organisations and volunteers in the four iot enabled source separation projects examined in this paper the government has played a central role even though the projects are established in different regions of china with different economic and cultural backgrounds when implementing iotenabled source separation in a residential community only the local government and its agencies have the authority resources and power to employ its legal and administration system to enforce compliance after an iotenabled system is in place there are ongoing requirements to educate residents to monitor the participation of residents and to give rewards and penalties to sustain the positive behavioural change in the public the effort involved in managing and admin istering this programme may initially form and consolidate the residents accountability for an initial period but longterm accountability requires an iot system to make the hwss work sustainable and durable this leads to the next proposition p to sustain a source separation programme over the long term all the involved stakeholders must cooperate to play their roles iot can facilitate such ef cacy by providing a platform to operationalise the processes and to enable accountability effec tively and ef ciently discussion theoretical implications this study makes a theoretical contribution by establishing the concept of iotenabled accountability and its multiple dimensions from a systems perspective a traceability service offers great support to establish accountability in the extant literature most of the traceability applications are associated with nonhuman ob jects however waste separation behaviour requires effort from individuals as proper household waste separation is essential for the achievement of a ce stoeva and alriksson this is where the accountability principle becomes important as it deals with human participants and often incorporates rewards and penalties to reshape behaviour although the importance of people s behaviour is widely recognised zhuang et al bernstad zhang and wen b little research has investigated the role of iot in bringing about a behavioural change in a source separation and ce context this study advances the eld by moving beyond iotenabled traceability to iotenabled accountability iotenabled accountability is not only useful for waste man agement but for any contexts where it would be bene cial to hold human participants accountable for example iot has been used to track the location and speed of automobile vehicles applications can be developed for monitoring drivers holding them accountable for irresponsible driving behaviours on a manufacturing shop oor iot can be used to trace which workers perform certain pro cess steps if defects and quality issues are a concern accountability applications can be developed for monitoring individual workers quality performance there is great potential for iot technology providers to market iotenabled accountability applications and future research can explore innovative marketing mechanisms the iotenabled source separation mechanism presented in thisresearch contributes to the rapidlygrowing literature on smart waste management smart waste management is a relatively new concept zhang et al that offers a promising future but also faces many challenges anagnostopoulos et al an iot enabled source separation mechanism could overcome a major challenge that is prevalent in many countries speci cally the major obstacle to source separation posed by the culture and the public s behaviours this is in line with the ndings of zhang et al that a lack of environmental education and a culture that is not oriented towards environmental protection is a key cause of barriers to smart waste management for a ce in china practical implications the general propositions advanced from the case studies on iot enabled accountability have extensive practical implications for implementing source separation of waste propositions e sug gest that iot systems can enable the accountability of waste gen erators residents and waste collectors as well as supporting and enabling positive interaction between their respective account abilities the case studies show that it is technically feasible to trace the households which dispose of bagged rubbish in a residential community and to hold them accountable for their waste disposal behaviour in the past there lacked an ef cient means to identify noncompliant citizens with regard to correct source separation of household waste however the advancement of iot technology could be a gamechanger to enforce accountability in household waste source separation similarly the iot system enables the accountability of waste collectors by providing realtime ll rate information to the waste management companies operating at the backend the data generated by the iot system would not only be useful in optimising the waste collection systems already in place the data could also be used to design the new source separation projects as part of the nationwide expansion of the proposed iot enabled source separation program thefth proposition suggests that a combination of positive ie reward and negative ie punishment incentives should be applied to effectively and ef ciently implement iotenabled source separation employing a positive or a negative reinforcement approach alone cannot fully achieve the desired outcome for example shanghai city in china recently started to enforce the very stringent regulations on the management of household waste from the july an individual may be ned to rmb and an organisation may be ned up to rmb for an infringement of the regulation on the st july organisations were ned in shanghai xinhaunet the determination of the shanghai government is commendable however the shanghai government faces the key challenge of identifying noncompliant citizens the longterm effectiveness of using punishment alone to enforce source separation also remains questionable in light of the case study ndings an iotenabled hwm system can help to accurately and ef ciently identify noncompliant citizens the researchers recommend a combination of a positive and negative rein forcement approach in the early stages of implementing iot enabled accountability which is more likely to achieve a long term and sustainable change in the waste disposal behaviours of the public lastly the sixth proposition suggests that all the involved stakeholders must cooperate to play their roles in order to sustain the iotenabled source separation programme over the long term despite having a long history of piloting various source separation projects and promoting ce nationwide the chinese enforcement ofb wang m farooque ry zhong et al journal of cleaner production environmental regulations has been considered weak farooque et al a zhang et al with the introduction of iot enabled accountability for source separation the chinese govern ment and policymakers now have a reliable and robust evidence base on which they can con dently enforce legislation on compulsory source separation it is now time for the chinese gov ernment to unify the waste separation and management standards to make more strategic investments in supporting infrastructure and systems and to develop speci c guidelines and educate the public about them the resulting changes would have signi cant impact on china s sustainable development of course there is a need for policymakers to consider potential privacy issues in iot enabled applications to secure data and channel accesses to pre vent the misuse of data alturjman and alturjman residential communities and their estate management need to play an important role in enforcing source separation with the rapid progress of urbanisation in china more and more people have moved to cities where they live in residential communities their estate management bears the responsibility of managing the household waste that is discarded they charge the residents a fee for their services however their traditional role is simply to coordinate rubbish collection by the waste management organisa tions and to keep the estate clean and tidy the sorting of rubbish if done at all is undertaken by local waste management organisa tions to implement an iotenabled source separation mechanism the estate management needs to be equipped with iot technology and deploy manpower to monitor residents compliance in prac tising source separation they also need to tailor training programs awards and penalties for their estates to optimise the likelihood of successful implementation waste management organisations need to shift their opera tional focus from land lls to value recovery from waste based on ce philosophy because about of the household waste is food waste there will be a great need to invest in food waste treatment facilities after implementing source separation these facilities need to be capable of using food waste to generate biogas organic fertiliser and protein feed it is advisable for waste management organisations to collaborate with a wide range of industry sectors to maximise value recovery as an example textile materials may be recycled to produce insulation products for the construction sector nasir et al conclusions many countries have faced serious challenges in managing ever increasing household waste the challenges are especially dif cult for developing countries due to rapid urbanisation and population growth source separation in line with the philosophies of cp and ce is a best practice for sustainable waste management however it has been little practised in china and many other developing countries due to complex issues with infrastructure culture envi ronmental education and the public s waste disposal habits the lack of accountability for these habits has been a major obstacle to enforcing source separation by the households which dispose of rubbish this research addresses this challenge by investigating the role of iot technologies in some of the most recent source separa tion projects which have achieved considerable success in establishing the concept of iotenabled accountability by studying multiple cases of innovative use of iot technologies in very recent years in china this paper offers a number of original con tributions earlier studies on source separation in china focused on the inhibiting factors which undermined many earlier pilot pro jects comparatively this research reveals the reasons for success insome of the more recent projects earlier studies have also reported iotenabled traceability applications but the use of iot to achieve accountability in managing human behaviour is a new research topic which warrants further studies furthermore this paper ad vances six theoretical propositions which explain the multiple di mensions of iotenabled accountability this study s results have signi cant practical implications iot enabled accountability in hwm contributes towards the develop ment and adoption of cp technologies for improving environmental sustainability the results of this study are of global signi cance because more and more countries are grappling with the challenge of hwm the underlying mechanism of iotenabled accountabilitythat is demonstrated by the case studies outlined in this paper offer guidance to other countries that are facing similar challenges in reshaping their citizens waste disposal behaviours this paper has its limitations of which one is its narrowed focus on accountability although lack of accountability is a key barrier to a successful source separation program there are many other barriers that also need to be overcome including issues in infra structure and legislation there is scope for future studies to investigate such other relevant factors moreover the context of thestudy is limited to china given that waste disposal behaviours are inuenced by culture it is worthwhile to broaden the scope of the research to different cultural contexts future studies should also investigate ways of determining the ideal levels of reward and punishment in order to reshape people s behaviour effectively a reward that is too small will be insuf cient to change people s behaviour while overly generous rewards will lead to excessive costs in the long run quantitative research is required in the design of the right rewardpenalty scheme in order to elicit the desired behaviours credit authorship contribution statement bill wang methodology investigation writing eoriginal draft writing ereview editing muhammad
