prevailing unsustainable production and consumption patterns and ecological crises the circular economy topic gains momentum however the implementation of the circular economy from a local governance point of view has been explored in a rather fragmented manner although public policies remain crucial in driving countries towards more circular systems this paper aims to explore whether and how local governments contribute to circular economy implementation by applying vo et als steering framework for sustainable development by using desk research analysis and focus group and individual interview discussions with representatives of municipalities and regional waste management centres we identified challenges for implementing the circular economy with a lack of local governments contribution namely municipal waste management textile waste distribution of human resources networking and local business finally we created a framework for circular solutions by mapping national and foreign practices through five perspectives namely learning sharing vision reflexive governance regulation and negotiation in networks introduction in the context of prevailing unsustainable production and con sumption models and ecological crises the circular economy topic gains momentum a circular economy is often presented as a practical strategy for implementing sustainable development geissdoerfer et al van den bergh the circular economy puts environmental sus tainability forward and acknowledges the need for favourable economic settings homrich et al but social sustainability is usually absent and may even reinforce social inequality johansson and henriksson the circular economy may be the expression towards weak sus tainability kirchherr et al johansson and henriksson as it suggests a system where recycling and reuse are assumed as substitutes for raw materials the urgency behind a circular transformation is based on a looming resource and ecological crisis hobson and lynch as well as globalisation and increase of resources consumption bonciu in practice the circular economy is implemented in diverse contexts from resource efficiency blomsa and brennan product design lacy et al van den bergh and product integrity stahel appropriate waste management and recycling ghisellini et al murray et al knickmeyer companies practices of reuse and repair cafes ghisellini and ulgiati postconsumption waste transformation into valuable materials braungart and mcdo nough and urban circular initiatives russell et al interestingly the implementation of the circular economy from a local governance point of view has been explored in a rather fragmented manner although public policies remain crucial in driving the eu to wards a full circular implementation cainelli et al historically the eu waste legislation is very detailed and mature since launching the first eu packaging directive in the end of life vehicles directive in the late s and the waste framework directive govern ments and policy makers mainly of developed countries have attempted to direct the growing material waste streams back into industry through recycling programs in order to close the material loop lieder and rashid obviously it has a direct impact on towns and cities by laying down waste management priorities and specific targets eg management of municipal waste ewaste

of eu economic policy russell et al when the european commission confirmed its closing the loop action plan in this action plan includes a broader definition of municipal waste and no longer limits the definition simply to waste that is collected by local governments european parliament with half of the global population living in urban areas towns and cities proper urban governance through local governments might play a significant role by facilitating a state s strategies to local communities and businesses however waste collection and recycling rates are het erogeneous over space varying among municipalities because of dif ferences in infrastructure ways of waste collection and maturity about environmental problems van den bergh furthermore the cir cular economy is increasingly used as the overarching strategy of municipal regional and international plans to foster green development fratini et al implementing circularity require systemic trans formations termeer and metze which can be hindered when some actors involved are not aware of the role they are expected to undertake senge et al especially when it comes to execution therefore it is expected that municipalities are responsible for facili tating a state s strategies to local communities and businesses and should take the lead although there are some empirical research studies about munici palities role to foster the circular economy through hybrid governance of solid waste management lindqvuist and urban circular ini tiatives fratini et al russell et al the major focus is on the cases of metropolitan cities prendeville et al cramer russell et al or chinese cities wang et al because of their economic and social importance population density and urbanisation moreover most of the previous research studies refer to the reviews of publicly available documents such as cities or countries strategic plans and reports johansson and henriksson while lacking a qualitative approach to the problem very few articles go into much depth when discussing how and what it takes to implement circular economy principles in urban contexts in general levoso et al or how municipalities accept this topdown approach and implement it little attention is paid in the scholarly circular economy literature to the active role that local governments can play the lack of fundamental analyses of the social contexts and institutional conditions under which the circular economy is being implemented is therefore considered an important barrier to its contributions to socially just and environmen tally desirable societal transitions moreau et al korhonen et al in addition recent research of the circular economy in small open countries is focused mostly on leaders such as belgium the netherlands finland sweden denmark etc there is a lack of comprehensive research about implementation of the circular economy in small econ omies which are in the initial stage of the transition to the circular economy mitrovic milan or ontrack to the circular economy momete therefore the pressing question remains to what extent and how municipalities may contribute to circular economy implementation across all steps in the value network the theoretical approach used in this study refers to an umbrella attitude towards the circular economy concept as well as vo et als steering framework for sustainable development our empirical focus is on lithuanian local governance lithuania is a country which has done well year over year moving up the rankings in three circular economy indicators namely per capita waste production and recycling rate of both municipal waste and packaging eu circular economy update there are three incineration plants and it is the only one country in the eu which banned the import of waste to incinerate circular economy initiatives are rather limited the country does not have any tax incentives in place for circular products or services our contribution is threefold first we expand the knowledge of challenges to local governments engaging in the circular economy furthermore we create the practical framework of circular solutions for local governments by mapping national and foreign practices through five perspectives namely learning sharing vision reflexive governance regulation and negotiation in networks our proposed steering solutions could be implemented beyond the lithuanian case in addition it would be important to set out a social contribution this study also aims to raise legislators awareness about the circular economy which goes beyond just waste management and also includes prevention and active collaboration with local communities and businesses the paper is organised as follows section outlines the overview of the circular economy through local governance and its theoretical foundation followed by section which presents the lithuanian local governance case section explains research methods in section the main results drivers gaps and key stakeholders are presented sec tions and present the discussion and conclusions background overview on the circular economy through local governance the concept of the circular economy does not belong to one science discipline and therefore it is difficult to define it lacks a strong scientific basis fratini et al and critical discussion johansson and hen riksson as it is loosely based on a fragmented collection of ideas derived from a variety of scientific disciplines and semiscientific con cepts korhonen et al the most known ones include cradletocradle where waste becomes a valueproducing resource braungart and mcdonough optimisation of productservices systems and the inertia principle stahel industrial ecology graedel and allenby and the triple bottom line elkington homrich et al defined the circular economy as opposition to linear openended systems aiming to face the challenges of resource scarcity and waste in a winwin approach between economic and environmental perspectives in this paper we follow blomsma and brennan with an umbrella approach derived from hirsch and levin towards the circular economy that is characterising it as a relation between preexisting concepts that were previously unrelated or not related in the manner the umbrella concept proposes by focusing attention on a particular shared quality or characteristic of the concepts by its comprehensive and encompassing content the circular economy differs from earlier attempts concerning only selective collection of waste or individual attempts to recycle or to increase energy efficiency bonciu in addition murray et al also refer to the cir cular economy as a general term covering all activities that reduce reuse and recycle materials in production distribution and consump tion processes murray et al p circular economy at local governance public sector institutions have a social and fiduciary responsibility to conserve natural resources and promote social welfare and equity it has far greater responsibilities for advancing the notion of sustainable development when compared to corporations ball et al lieder and rashid proposed topdown and bottomup approaches to support ce implementation topdown approach contains legislation and policy and support infrastructure and social awareness hence public institutions advocate a collective consciousness about environ mental issues as well as societal benefit of industrial activities by strict control of industrial businesses the prevalent institutions were established and designed in times when linear economy concepts dominated the discourse termeer and metze noted that currently institutions constrain circular choices ghahari et al explored relationship between in vestments and performance using regional statelevel us data regional expenditure does not always reflect the actual work performed on infrastructure improvements because it does not account for wastage management and operational inefficiencies and corruption by car rying out a comparison between ecocycle and circular economy policies l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production in sweden johansson and henriksson also noted that the state is represented rather as an inherent obstacle than as a facilitator to other actors based on the functional institutional approach public in stitutions seek to perform their function of fulfilling efficient contracting roland local governments are formal institutions responsible for municipal waste management however such an approach does not explain the needs evolution and change of a specific institution nor does it reveal much about how institutions interact a literature review discovers a distinct discourse towards socalled circular cities levoso et al explored how urban systems iden tify their circularity potential and use it to develop a plan for the implementation of circular strategies given the dependency of urban areas on energy water and material resources cities will only heighten the issues brought by the linear economy if a paradigm change is not enforced lehmann it is worth mentioning the study by pre ndeville et al which explored how dutch cities adopt the cir cular economy as a strategy although none of the investigated cities has the appropriate institutional setting to create a circular economy pre ndeville et al p developed a definition for a circular city which is a city that practices principles to close resource loops in partnership with the citys stakeholders citizens community business and knowledge stakeholders to realise its vision of a futureproof city cramer questioned how the implementation of the circular economy actually takes place and evolves over time using the example of the amsterdam metropolitan area fratini et al explored how the circular economy is imagined in the academic literature in support of sustainability transitions in european cities and how european cities imagine the circular economy as a knowable object of governance fratini et al suggested conceptualising and operationalising the circular economy through the prism of sociotechnical imaginaries namely discourse analysis institutions representations and identities cities have quite different translations of the circular economy imagi nary as their engagement with the circular economy has aligned to preexisting political and institutional arrangements fratini et al although global policies are necessary to set the goal of transitioning towards the circular economy local interventions are crucial to make the goal a reality levoso et al cities could play a vital role by managing local transport and waste and water systems and offering lo cations for lowcarbon innovations nevens et al pitkanen et al emphasised municipalities commitment and active participation in fostering green and circular initiatives in the more localscale cases public sector involvement might work to increase the credibility of the green business cases termeer and metze analysed to what extent and how governments can contribute to transitions or transformative change especially since the circular economy inherently conflicts with norms underlying existing policies and regulations kirchherr et al korhonen et al initially the rise of many nonprofit recycling initiatives that served charitable and community building purposes was cast as a moral duty to the environment blomsma and brennan gradually these smallscale initiatives became primarily the responsibility of larger or ganisations due to solid waste management finally at the local level in particular in urban centres small initiatives promoting circular practices contribute to the renewal of urban centres and the reuse of public places ghisellini and ulgiato various sustainability transitions are qualified as too slow for example recycling at such a tempo would be far too slow to achieve a closed loop overall the circular economy has most often been consid ered only as an approach to more appropriate waste management ghisellini et al which is not surprising as recycling is funda mental to the circular economy murray et al hence more attention should be paid to opportunities for developing a local dimension of recycling in the circular economy van den bergh and greater enforcement and more active public participation in the shifting of consumption practices hobson and lynch van den bergh suggests distinguishing pragmatic realistic ce policies e g depositrefund system from imaginative futurist strategies eg in crease the intensity of a product s lifetime regulation of advertising this paper in contrary to previous research fratini et al prendeville et al levoso et al does not analyse strategies of circular cities that is cities which declared themselves as having unique strategies to contribute and implement the circular economy it takes rather an overarching approach by taking a series of different municipalities to deeply understand how they implement desirable cir cular transitions theoretical frame for steering circular economy in municipalities by explaining how municipalities could better serve to facilitate circular economy implementation we refer to vo et als steering framework for sustainable development fig following blomsma and brennan and hirsch and levin an umbrella approach is adopted to conceptualise the circular economy actually there are many widespread umbrella concepts such as zero waste resource efficiency bioeconomy sustainable consumption and produc tion and green economy both the circular economy and sustainable development might be treated as umbrella concepts used loosely to encompass and account for a set of diverse phenomena hirsch and levin following vo et als framework we adapt ambivalence uncertainty and distributed power for explaining and steering the circular implementation from municipalities point of view ambivalence the concept of the circular economy is affected by its inherent subjectivity particularly when it comes to implementation different actors value and frame reality differently hence tradeoffs between diverse goals which are generally accepted as legitimate occur one example can be related with the usage of more recyclable materials and prolonging a product s lifecycle for example if one uses more regeneratedrecycled cotton in manufacturing the products quality may be less and would last a shorter period of time in addition often these goals remain vague in terms of focus quantification and timescale vo et al when it comes to waste management which is historically mature european parliament the european commission has set common eu targets for recycling municipal waste of by and for recycling packaging waste of by such measurable targets decrease the ambivalence however other areas of implementing the circular economy are lacking clear outcomes for example implementing ecodesign and circular cooperation moreover local government managers who focus their efforts only on fulfilling policymaking for the central government may be doing so solely for tokenistic purposes andrews and beynon local governments need to realise the potential of inclusive decision processes by being open to public input and considering a variety of viewpoints enables decisions based on local knowledge knickmeyer uncertainty in line with uncertainty about how to interpret the circular economy kirchherr et al there is no full agreement on what its precise objective should be van den bergh korhonen et al a special aspect of the circular economy problems is that they contain interactions between very different elements from the do mains of society technology and the environment vo et al moreover the engineering and natural science orientated studies constitute the biggest body of knowledge behind the circular economy and have been developed in isolation from strategic management and organisational studies governmental decisions are extremely important in implementing circular solutions as engineering aspects and techno logical barriers usually do not stop the circular economy transition kirchherr et al one way to reduce uncertainty about the cir cular economy is raising social awareness the movement in this area has been well supported by the public institutions and educational programs and public campaigns as well as seminars have increased significantly during the last few years lieder and rashid l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production distributed power the linear and the circular economy differ in individual decisions actions related to reusing recycling and remanu facturing and a structured and systemic approach carried out in a regulated manner at the eu bonciu the national goals for the circular economy are decentralised across countries although each country has its own targets mostly recycling of different waste streams the achievement of goals is distributed across the country eventually regions and municipalities should embed circularity targets into their strategic plans and agendas research on the circular economy empha sises the need for systemic transformations senge et al that cover indepth systemwide and quick changes simultaneously which is virtually impossible because of the inherent tradeoffs between them there are positive societal environmental shifts moreau et al as indepth change requires people to break through their routines learn about new modes of behaviour and challenge existing cultures ter meer and metze through networking local governments seek to better meet their service responsibilities being underpinned with a logic of consequences andrews and beynon collaborations across institutions also lead to more effective service delivery oseikojo et al and diminish the effect of distributed power to sum up municipalities are commonly ambivalent about goals knowledge of the circular economy is often uncertain and the power reflected in related responses is often widely decentralised lithuanian local governance case the eu is confronted with a double challenge for policymaking supporting the laggards to catch up and challenging the frontrunners to make next steps to fully close the loops and move towards shorter loop rimperatives reike et al importantly lithuania has been considered as a modest performer of the circular economy lithuania s performance in the three major circular areas related to eco innovation indexes covered is lacklustre with all three ranking in the bottom half of eu member states eu circular economy update lithuania is a small open economy with million inhabitants which became a member of the eu in based on eurostat data in lithuania gdp per capita in is euro or of eu lithuania belongs to the group of high human development countries undp intraeu trade accounts for of lithuania s exports latvia poland and germany while outside the eu goes to russia and to the united states in terms of imports come from eu member states germany poland and latvia while outside the eu comes from russia and from china based on eurostat data the services sector contributes to the gdp and employs of the active population the most important sectors of lithuania s economy are wholesale and retail trade transport accommodation and food services information technology and com munications sectors tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors the industrial sector contributes to the gdp and employs around of the active population the main industrial sectors are electronics chemical products machine tools metal processing construction ma terial household appliances food processing light industry including textile and furniture the country is also developing oil refineries and shipyards the manufacturing sector alone contributes to of the country s gdp agriculture contributes to the gdp and employs of the workforce there are counties that differ by area and population fig regional waste management centres ratc and municipalities which are the main administrativeterritorial units sixtyseven percent of lithuania s population live in urban areas municipal waste management in lithuania follows a european pattern of outsourcing or externalisation as a thirdgeneration policy area lindqvist local public private partnerships are rare as the municipalities have rather contracted out or kept the provision of ser vices inhouse or through fully or partially owned companies eg ratc the public municipal waste management services are quite well developed in these services covered of all inhabitants and of economic entities local public service delivery networks are constituted by multistakeholders ranging from waste carriers and waste recyclers in the local community to those at the regional ratc incineration plants and national levels in thousand tons of municipal waste was collected in fig theoretical frame for steering circular economy implementation adapted from vo et al fig descriptive statistics of lithuanian counties based on statistics lithuania l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production lithuania more than half of all municipal waste was collected in the three most populous and economically active regions naturally urban regions generate more municipal waste than rural ones lith uania s overall municipal waste per capita fig a indicator seeks kgper capita that is lower than the eu average kgper capita implying that on average the regional consumption is less than average in the eu and therefore generates less waste the collection of municipal waste is based on a container system in of municipal waste was delivered to largescale waste collection sites and through complementary systems the rest of the municipal waste was collected by bypassing and other means the overall recycled municipal waste compared to municipal waste generated fig b indicator was and was higher than the average of the eu of that number more than of waste was composted often in low demand and only was recycled including export the highest recycling rate was seen in recycling packages of glass paper and paperboard metal and pet from deposit systems the lower recycling rate was seen in various other type of plastic especially in combined and textile waste even though mostly all municipalities cross the recycling rate recycling target recycling indicators should be treated with caution municipal waste still largely ended at landfills even in regions where significant investments were made in ratc for mechanicalbiological treatment that is about of all municipal waste was disposed of in landfills and about incinerated in of all collected municipal waste was mixed municipal waste an average of kg per capita generated in addition of all mixed municipal waste was biodegradable waste fig which consisted of textile waste wastepaper and paperboard green waste and other waste unfortunately of all mixed municipal waste still consisted of various types of packaging waste glass waste metal waste and electrical and electronic equipment therefore the role of primary waste sorting is very important as of waste could not fall into the overall mixed municipal waste flow research methods the research presents an inductive access and interpretive perspec tive based on the lithuania local governance case table presents a summary of applied research methods to deeply understand the main challenges of the circular economy focus group discussions and interviews have been carried out a focus group from to people is focused on a specific discussion which takes place in a semistructured conversation and in an informal setting a semistructured interview is used to reveal the depth of insights about circular economy implementation in municipalities it is important to note that focus group discussions were organised for smaller groups and similar to other municipalities and interviews were organised for larger municipalities the participants were selected according to their fig a municipal waste per capita fig b recycled municipal waste compared to municipal waste generated fig mixed municipal waste composition l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production relevance to the topic or their own willingness to participate in the discussion the research involved three focus groups which consisted of five to six municipalities members this number corresponds to the optimal size of the focus group and is suitable for further data analysis also it was organised with three interviews with representatives of larger municipalities and three interviews with representatives of ratc out of the total of participants table most of them work in a position directly related to environmental issues finally by applying webscan research good practices leading to fostering the circular urban initiative have been identified main results drivers gaps and key stakeholders based on the results of focus groups interviews discussions among researchers and following lee open codes grouped into three axial codes namely drivers gaps and key stakeholders in the circular value chain have been identified table the main gaps related to the implementation of the circular economy cover waste management textile waste and local business unambig uously municipal waste management problems are the most signif icant and mainly influenced by residents reluctance to sort lack of information about sorting and bulky waste or homeless waste the cities residents in particular apartment dwellers still sort waste poorly which results in large quantities of mixed waste moreover the lack of infor mation about sorting is still a problem in more rural areas even though publicity is widely used by municipalities homeless waste appeared also to be an important problem which signals low environmental awareness this problem is more relevant for rural areas as bulky waste is usually left near the municipal waste collection containers or in the wilderness along the rivers the other challenge stressed by municipalities is increases of textile waste which are influenced by insufficient textile collection infrastructure and lack of information the current textile collection infrastructure is not provided properly as containers fill up quickly or are far from the res idents however this problem may be potentially temporary as munic ipalities must implement a textile containers system by on the other hand residents are constantly stockpiling textiles that were not previously gathered the other reason for increasing textile waste is the lack of information because for residents it is important to know what is going on with the textiles that are being collected finally municipalities weakly cooperate with local business because historically this cooperation was not regulated by laws moreover local business has been identified more as an obstacle one of these aspects concerns insufficient business environmental responsibility because industrial waste is mixed with municipal waste particularly in smaller municipalities the other aspect is the problem of waste from illegal businesses eg car repair companies garages if it were possible to identify the main waste carriers and propose specialised waste collection methods eg different types of containers this problem would be solved furthermore information and education about the potential opportunities and benefits of legalising a business should be useful too it is also important to emphasise the activities of other economic entities such as farmers collection of hay films on farmers farms and storage of agricultural machinery tires and tire manufacturers and importers who table summary of used research methods research methods desk research focus group discussion interviews data collection

division siauliai ratc ecologist klaip leda ratc head of waste management division regional nonhazardous waste landfill l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production deal with the specifics of certain waste management there are significantly too many tires to be disposed of which become homeless waste man ufacturers and importers are not obliged to keep separate accounts for agricultural tires and double their handling costs and instead of organising the management of these large tires some manufacturers and importers choose a waste manager which handles a corresponding quantity of truck and passenger car tires and benefits from a tax also there is the problem of using a waste management accounting system gpais all representatives of municipalities and ratc stressed that they communicate with local residents through various types of communica tion on a regional waste management level cooperation with academia universities schools kindergartens or other educational institutions is quite highly developed through participation in lectures ecological projects educational sessions and events however the most prob lematic cooperation is with local business because it is based on the principles of control for example municipality takes prevention warns the company about their industrial waste increases the control of waste from manufacturing companies or there is no dialogue with local busi nesses at all the local cooperation difficulties arise because business companies have their own contracts with waste managers on the other hand some cooperation is observed in individual municipalities for example entrepreneurs association ratc usually act as in termediaries among residents waste collectors and recyclers incinera tion plants and landfilling additionally an important problem appeared to be the distribution of human resources at local governance apparently in smaller mu nicipalities only one person is assigned to be responsible for environ mental activities including the circular economy meanwhile in larger municipalities different departments are responsible for one or two activities often not related to the circular economy local governments should collaborate more involving as many other stakeholders as possible in the case of households the municipality s collaboration is highly regulated by contracts and rules including activities of municipal waste collection and recycling with households ratc waste management companies waste carriers and reuse share and repair with other households through ratc sharing places in the case of businesses the municipality s relations are significantly less regulated by contracts and rules except for municipal waste collection and partial recycling in other circular value chain parts like secondary raw ma terials design reuse repair the municipality s relations with other stakeholders are of recommendatory nature drivers related to the circular economy mainly include society s education publicity provision of infrastructure and initiatives pub licity or provision of information to the society appeared to be the most common role taken by municipalities the ways of publicity are very similar followed by regulative and mimetic reasons for example print articles in the local press information on sorting is provided on the websites of the municipality and ratc organised shows on cable tv radio radio quizzes cooperation with schools kindergartens lectures participation in ecological projects and events of educational institutions after the installation of underground sites public events were organised to present the new infrastructure and leaflets booklets ratc also communicate about their activities by emphasising the importance of primary sorting through the media radio newspapers and social media the other obligatory function which municipalities fulfil is non formal education which is mostly orientated towards changing households waste sorting behaviour creative society is encouraged rangers at containers teach residents how to sort municipality makes actions when once a year with ecologists and controllers they pass through towns and tell how to sort preventive supervision prevention is taken by warning companies that may mix industrial waste with municipal waste municipalities organise and allocate funds for the implementation of tenders for nature protection projects and collaborative initiatives for society actions with the community such as do action involve children businesses operating on the principles of circular economy which share their experience municipalities infrastructure facilitates the implementation of the circular economy with the obvious focus on waste collection and sorting battery collection system is well developed solving the sorting problem by implementing recessed systems with chips counting the number of times sorting containers have been used invests in innovations equipment that could improve the sorting of municipal waste initially the municipality conducts a pilot in one urban district by purchasing equipment eg animal waste containers and monitors the usage by households their awareness in this way it is decided whether it is worth investing because it is a lot of money ratc also provide an infrastructure for sharing things for reuse purposes which they promote by publicising it overall the ob tained results are not surprising as the identified activities are directly related to the key functions of the municipalities for example municipal waste collection discussion steering solutions following our theoretical model the research results confirm that municipalities identify the circular economy mostly as waste manage ment and seek to contribute as much as defined by the legal framework hence knowledge about the circular economy is uncertain vo et al and this hinders the implementation of the circular economy on a wider scale historical functions of municipalities that is waste col lecting and waste recycling limit implementation of circular solutions termeer and metze in line with johansson and henriksson s study about circu larity shifts in swedish environmental policy an identified problem is also the lockin of legislation in the linear economy for example ac cording to the legal acts ratc cannot deliver waste directly to table summary of results elements of theoretical frame axial codes subcodes definition challenges for implementing the circular economy gaps uncertain knowledge ambivalence municipal waste management problems related to the waste management such as low quality of sorting lack of motivation to sort bulky waste etc textile waste problems related to the textile waste such as lack of collecting infrastructure lack of information etc local business problems related to the local business eg insufficient business environmental responsibility waste generation management accounting system gpais problems problems of waste from illegal businesses etc key stakeholders distributed power uncertain knowledge human resources problems related to the distribution of human resources at local governance networking collaboration between municipalities ratc and stakeholders such as residents academia waste management companies etc steering solutions drivers education and publicity citizens education training courses etc and environmental publicity initiatives provision of infrastructure infrastructure which helps ensure the implementation of the circular economy such as deposit system battery collection system purchasing of equipment l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production industrial companies because legally waste is not treated as a product therefore they sell or deliver waste only to waste recyclers incinera tion or landfills so ambivalence of goals complicates the imple mentation of the circular economy at the local level therefore the development of local national and international coherent environ mental policies is a critical initiator through making circular options more viable creating new funding opportunities or setting targets for future development pitkanen et al according to the conceptual framework we argue that there are five types of solutions for circular economy implementation regulation shared vision learning education negotiation in networks and re flexive governance fig the learning solutions which are related to the society s education and publicity are the most popular in relation to the circular economy various publications were prepared and published on websites to inform residents for example information leaflet waste path from container to recycling booklet on sorting for school children waste ency clopaedia waste management memo in addition in the media of the region residents were constantly informed about the development of the waste management systems innovations and relevance eg radio series on the environmental theme in green channel and the ecology sec tion computer games about waste sorting films for children about waste sorting electronic map of sorting containers ratc together with munic ipalities encourage residents to participate in various competitions and projects national project we sort regional waste sorting competitions or competition stop using come up with how to reuse organised ex cursions to the regional waste landfill lectures and seminars on the environmentally friendly method of extraction and the importance of waste sorting and consultation seminars on the promotion of respon sible consumption culture and ecological behaviour in associations and municipalities also contribute to the provision of the educational function the negotiation in networks could be ensured by building networking municipalities are starting to cooperate with the associa tions for initial discussions about the circular economy and infra structure enhancing sharing for example ratc together with municipalities organised the bypasses for the collection of bulky waste including electronic waste and organised the collection of unnecessary books to landfills furthermore the storage points have been set up at existing bulky waste collection points where unnecessary items can be shared the shared visions which are related to the different initiatives mostly sharing activities are one of the least active activities in relation to the circular economy because of the compulsory environmental re quirements a product waste collection campaign is organised in all ratc whereas some types of waste are collected free of charge from residents institutions and organisations the campaign received compost free of charge was carried out for all residents for the delivered complete devices electrical and electronic equipment not less than kg the resident is given m of green waste compost free of charge because of the compulsory environmental requirements solutions related to the regulation and reflexive governance are mostly oriented to waste management in addition we also reviewed circular solutions from municipalities of other countries it is noticeable that the trend is the opposite the dominated good practices are related to the shared visions these shared visions are expressed by various types of sharing platforms for example in living lab the environment works as an innovation platform an urban laboratory where new solutions can be developed and tested helsinki a peer rental service for parking spaces where its owners can rent their spaces to others when they do not need them helsinki free rental platform of slovenian designed clothing ljubljana in seoul there is the tradition where people share food with neighbours borrow and lend tools and equipment or other goods with others and exchange labour at harvest time the seoul government also supports new startup businesses and larger corporate companies to increase their sharing services including the provision of coworking space that is municipalityowned car and bike sharing programs children s clothes and toy sharing project sharing of public community centres they also consider circular solutions by promoting initiatives related to the local production repair and reuse initiatives such as repair cafe where the idea is to have experts in different pro fessions electricians seamstresses carpenters and volunteers available once a month to help repair and refurbish products ljubljana reuse and repair activities cooperative supermarkets and food waste recovery initiatives promote responsible consumption and help to develop local activities and production in paris it is noticeable that the other important group of solutions for circular economy implementation by municipalities is learning in other countries solutions related to learning or education are expressed by organising trainingsseminars lectures for changing experience knowledge and skills in such cities as amsterdam brussels glasgow london kristiansand etc in other countries solutions related to the negotiation networks are expressed by creating the centres for citizens and business cooperation in such cities as amsterdam brussels glasgow london kristiansand etc and by the improvement of infrastructure for circular solutions for example transform fly ash from incineration plants to building materials including road construction kristiansand when resurfacing asphalt roads the waste products millings and chippings are then reused in constructionrenovation of streets and sidewalks as added volume for banks in the unbound bearing layers andor for the subbase layer ljubljana and old bus seats are used for children s playground equipment ljubljana the solutions for circular economy imple mentation related to the regulation and reflexive governance are less popular among municipalities regulation is expressed by allocation of financial and nonfinancial instruments for example in ljubljana farmers who sell directly to restaurants and hotels are supported from the city tourism office in london finances are provided to help fund circular economy businesses in new york there is governmentfunded research on material reuse and intensive organic farming is supported lille reflexive governance is expressed by integration of the cir cular economy principles into public procurement processes in such cities as berlin paris toronto and basel furthermore the supple mentation of municipal environmental policies and plans in such city as brussels becomes important as a reflexive governance solution it is noticeable that when analysing the actions of other countries for the circular economy there are various solutions which involve more stakeholders for example municipalityresident municipalitybusi ness municipalitybusinessresident etc according to knickmeyer the leadership of local governments can be improved through reliability ability to effectively treat sorted waste legitimacy punitive measures and effectiveness dissemination of information about the program benefits however the current activities that promote circular economy implementation at the lithuanian local governance level are quite fragmented mostly related to responsible waste management and oriented mostly to compliance with environmental requirements and laws the circular economy also emphasises ecodesign initiatives and attempts to keep the product in the market by reusing resharing and remanufacturing although the state is given the role of supporting market initiatives through soft initiatives this is still in the very initial although growing stage for example creating sharing platforms for used goods or support by developing a local dimension of recycling our results are in line with johansson and henriksson that the re sponsibility for establishing circularity is left to the market in the form of consumersindividuals and companiesentrepreneurs therefore the role of local governments should be more proactive and strengthening across the circular value chain the complexity and multisectoral na ture of the circular economy call for multilevel and multigovernance  l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production approaches pitkanen et al and rethinking of conventional regional economic development policies implications for academia we clarified the interactions between the circular economy and local governance which appeared to be scant in the scientific literature importantly we adapted vo et als steering framework for sustainable development to facilitate the implementation of the circular economy by local governance implications for local governments we identified challenges for implementing the circular economy within the lack of municipalities and ratc contributions we created a practical framework of circular solutions for local governments by mapping national and foreign prac tices through five perspectives namely learning sharing vision reflex ive governance regulation and negotiation in networks our proposed steering solutions could be implemented beyond the lithuanian case to support transition to the circular economy local governments should more focus on smart waste management which systemically contains automatisation of waste segregation collection and route optimisation as well as digital apps for creating communication eco innovations related to waste management schemes and policies to support local governments in implementing smart waste management one way is to apply digital solutions such as introducing electronic sensors and gradually automating materials and processes to achieve higher waste sorting levels resulting in higher levels of recycling edu cation and social innovations raising social awareness is a longterm important tool specifically lithuanian municipalities are going to commit to responsibilities regarding food waste separation from the municipal waste stream as regards the reduction of large amounts of textile waste encompassing national strategy for circular textile should be created with clear action plans for textile waste sorting and recycling and initial discussions with local business about expanded producers responsibility schemes finally it is important to mention not to be trapped within the recycling economy losing opportunities to advance towards innovative features of the circular economy such as product design renewability integration of patterns and collaborative pro duction systems implications for society this research also aims to raise local gov ernments awareness about the circular economy which goes beyond just waste management and also includes prevention and active collaboration with business and local communities in particular this research tries to understand the changing role of municipalities from just functional implementation to wider networking across the circular value chain conclusions the current role of local governments is based just on functional waste management and still lacks a wider networking across the circular value chain in the context of the circular economy development of human resources together with a learning society are highly important from our research it is highly evident that those circular economy solutions which are not regulated are very weakly implemented by local governance current solutions are mostly orientated to waste management learning education is the most developed by local governance while steering solutions of sharing a vision reflexive governance regulation and negotiation in networks are at the initial stage we identified the tradeoff between large volumes of communica tions a very developed function and lack of information about waste travelling across the value chain and a still developing culture of municipal waste sorting it should be noted that some streams of waste have high sorting rates for example pet bottles packaging collected by the deposit system sorting of municipal waste by residents is still a problem although huge investments have been assigned for waste sorting infrastructure and communication tools green procurement is also weakly developed all solutions should move from just waste management orientation to a wider implementation of the circular fig summary of solutions for circular economy implementation at local governance l dagilien le et al journal of cleaner production economy despite the fact that the research was carried out only in lithuania the results might be compared with other countries taking into account national contexts research results might be useful for seeing certain trends and providing further recommendations the similarities and differences might be identified between common eu and national trends especially for modest countries regarding the circular economy implementation future research at the research moment municipalities were in a transition period of preparing new strategic development plans for therefore the detailed documents content analysis on strategic plans and relationship with operational level would be valu able particularly it is important to explore how key performance in dicators included in the strategic plans are being integrated within municipality s internal accounting systems or how municipalities do integrate energy and water usage materials and food waste measure ment at local governance level thus our study suggests that more research is needed into the more critical aspects of implementing cir cular economy strategies by local governance in terms of environmental rebound effects regulatory impacts effects of digital solutions and development of environmental performance
