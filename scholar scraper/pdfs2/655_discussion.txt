Gaustad,  Krystoﬁk,  Bustamante,  and Badami  (2018) argue that the 
circular  economy  (along with other lean manufacturing  principles)  can 
be applied  to critical and strategic  material  disruptions.  While we found 
that total quality management  has a signiﬁcant  impact on lean man- 
ufacturing  in the steel recycling  industry  (H1, Table 8 ). We have dis- 
covered  through  the use of new technologies  such as shredders  that 
proper processing  management  is critical in steel recycling.  While lean 
manufacturing  enables  waste to be eliminated  during the manufacturing  
process,  conventional  buildings  are designed  on-site using non-standard  
materials  and components,  eﬀectively  prohibiting  lean manufacturing  
( Minunno,  O’Grady,  Morrison,  Gruner,  & Colling,  2018 ). 
Kamble,  Belhadi,  Gunasekaran,  Ganapathy,  and Verma (2021) dis- 
covered  that industry  4.0 technology  is frequently  used in conjunction  
with lean manufacturing  concepts  to reduce manufacturing  waste and 
achieve  sustainable  results.  Similarly,  we argue that integrating  power 
plants into recycling  facilities  has the potential  to have a signiﬁcant  im- 
pact on the steel industry.  Unlike Singh, Chakraborty,  and Roy (2018) , 
who discovered  a negligible  eﬀect of perceived  behavioral  control on
