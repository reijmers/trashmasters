To better understand the relative strengths of these factors we specify a model to characterize the attractiveness of different sorting schemes to the household We adopt a discrete choice experiment DCE method to investigate the tradeoffs households make between variouscharacteristicsofdifferentwastesortingschemesDCEisawell suited method for eliciting preferences for outcomes which can be de scribed by a set of attributes The method has been widely used in differentfieldshowevertothebestofourknowledgeitsapplications for quantifying household preferences for waste sorting schemes are still limited except a few examples Karousakis and Birol Czajkowski et al Lee et al This paper makes a contribution to the field in a number of ways Firstly in previous environmental economic studies investigatinghousehold preferences for waste separation the waste sorting system has been largely described by the number of fractions to sort for ex ample fraction no sorting required fractions fractions and so on egCzajkowski et al In the present paper we investigate how households preferences for waste sorting schemes may differ according to the specific waste categories Household waste consists of many different waste types and the environmental externalities and scope for resource reutilisation varies significantly across categories Focusing only on the number of sorting fractions is insufficient for environmental economic evaluation of alternative sorting systems In thispaperweincludeattributestoexplicitlyindicatethetypesofwasteto sort Hazardous waste eg chemicals batteries paint nail vanish plasticsandbiowastetoreflectthediversityofthewasteSortingbio waste is a relevant case as biowaste makes up the large share of the total household waste quantity eg Riber et al Moreover the sorting of biowaste might exert inconvenience to households due tohygiene and unpleasant odours especially during hot summer seasons egGilli et al The degree of inconvenience can be an im portant factor reducing households waste sorting and has been esti mated in monetary terms the socalled inconvenience cost using DCE Lee et al Batteries other hazardous waste and plastics present important environmental risk as these are among waste frac tions with high content of hazardous chemical substances including mercury Hg lead Pb and cadmium Cd Riber et al Fur thermore while recycling of plastics is currently increasing the en vironmental and economic rationales are being debated Craighill and Powell Gradus et al Secondly in the existing economic literature time has been sug gested as a relevant variable in explaining households waste sorting behaviour eg Kipperberg Huhtala Gilli et al However the explicit treatment of time in the designs of previousstudieshasbeenlimitedifnotnonexistentThedesignoftheresearch forthepresentpapermakesitpossibletomakeanexplicitassessmentof the cost of time incurred by households which can potentially be in cluded in costbenefit analyses of alternative household waste sorting systems Thirdly while previous studies are largely more local in the coverage eg specific neighbourhood a city the analysis for the present paper draws from a Danish nationwide survey with a large sample size n As such the present study encompasses the variation in preferences among households representing the nationalsociodemographic spread and existing variation in household waste recycling schemes From the identification of household preferences

households are likely to opt for particular waste separation schemes and by investigating to what extent the designs of waste se paration options shape households willingness to engage in sorting activities Thepaperisstructuredasfollows Sectionprovidesanoverviewof previousstudiesonhouseholdpreferencesforparticipatingindifferent waste management programs Section describes the modelling ap proach and data collection process Section presents the findings of the research and section discusses these in light of existing body of literatureSection provides concluding remarks and policy insights Overview of existing economic literature on household wastesorting behaviour Studies on household preferences for waste handling schemes to date have been approached using different scenarios For exampleusing contingent valuation survey in Finland Huhtala in vestigatedhouseholdpreferencesovertwodifferentwastemanagement systemsrecyclingversusincinerationAccordingtohercalculationan average resident would have much higher probability for choosingrecyclingoverincinerationHuhtalasfindingspointto income as an important determinant of the household preferences where high income households tend to express higher willingness to pay for incineration than recycling Huhtalas interpretation of the finding is that recycling demands more effort and time and that op portunitycostoftimeishigherforhouseholdswithhigherincomethan those with lower income Furthermore under the assumption that a householdspendsbetweenandminperweekrecyclingandthat the use of spare time has a value of half the wage rate Huhtala esti matesthetimecostassociatedwithrecyclingtobewithintherangeof FIM EUR per hour in Another example a study by Lee et al used a choice ex periment to investigate peoples preferences for and the inconvenience costofwastesortingalternativesinSouthKoreaMorespecificallyLee et al investigated to what extent waste sorting preferences are influ enced by among other things the availability of an automatic sorting system inacentralfacilitywith focus onfood wasteandrecyclables theoptionofaprivatecompanyvisitingandcollectingwastefromeach individual household and the hygiene level of the spot where house holds otherwise have to drop off their waste Lee et al found hetero geneity in the waste sorting preferences and the associated incon venience costs To illustrate this even though an automated centralizedsortingsystemwouldrequirelesseffortsomepeoplestill prefer to do the sorting themselves manual Moreover the study showsthatyoungerpeopleexpresshigherinconveniencecostcompared with the older people Kipperberg and Larson employed a contingent rating ex periment and evaluated household preferences over five community recycling programs reflecting anticipated policy changes in the com munity recycling system in Seattle Variation in the five programs was characterized by differences in the expected overall recycling rate and the estimated cost that each household has to bear per month They reported variations in individual preferences and over the recycling programs Their analysis also showed socioeconomic and attitude fac tors as determinants of the heterogeneity in respondents preferences across different community recycling programs For example their findings showed that introducing a food waste recycling program was not particularly appealing to older respondents and male respondents while a positive preference was observed for respondents with higher educationallevelWhilethefindingsof Huhtala clearlyshowed income as an important explanatory factor for household waste recycling preferences the findings of Kipperberg and Larson D Nainggolan et al Ecological Economics suggestthattherelationbetweenincomeandhouseholdpreferencesfor recyclingactivitiesisnotthatstraightforwardKipperbergandLarsons study found household income only marginally significant for one specificprogramnamelytheprohibitionofmixingrecyclableitemsinto general waste A study from the UK showed statistically insignificant relationship between recycling rate and income Abbott et al Someotherstudiesinvestigatedtowhatextenthouseholdspreferto sort waste at home as opposed to the alternative of leaving the waste sorting to be professionally handled by another party for example at a centralfacilityDifferencesinthefindingsfromthesestudiesareworth notingForexampleinastudyby BartelingsandSternerof the respondents would consider the possibility of not having to do thesorting themselves however only of this group ie of the total respondents expressed positive willingness to pay for such a service The study reported an average WTP of SEK EUR a figure which is about five times lower than the estimated value of sorting effort of SEK EUR which is based on the average numberofhoursspentonsortingandtheaverageincomeperhourafter taxAnotherexampleinastudyfromNorwayby Bruvolletal of the respondents would rather have the sorting conducted by a recyclingcompanyalbeitunderthepremisethattheprovisionofsuch a service does not lead to additional expenses on the respondents On the contrary choice experiment based studies by Czajkowski et al and again in reported that on average their respondents prefer to sort waste at home even if doing so incurs cost including efforts and time to the respondents To illustrate of their re spondents display a positive preference for sorting their household waste into five categories compared to not doing any sorting Previousresearchhasshownthathouseholdchoicestotakepartin more demanding waste handling schemes such as recycling can be explained by a multitude of factors Household participation is influ encedbythesocalledinconveniencefactorbecausehouseholdshave to make effort to allocate space and to give up time to undertake recycling activities Huhtala Sidique et al a Czajkowski et al These activities also incur extra household expenses eg due to the use of warm water for cleaning some of the materials eg Bruvoll et al The provision of waste collection set up and re cyclinginfrastructurewhichcontributestolesseningtheinconvenience factor has also been shown as an important determinant Gilli et al To illustrate travel distance to a dropoff recycling site has negative effects on the rate of visits to the site Sidique et al a Studiesshowthathouseholdsdisplaygreaterrecyclingactivitiesunder thecurbsidecollectionsystemthanifthehouseholdsthemselveshave to transport the recyclable materials to a collection station eg Hong et al Caplan et al Karousakis and Birol Sidique et al b Gilli et al Existing studies also show that more frequent collection systems tend to be preferred by households egKarousakis and Birol Czajkowski et al Furthermore people express different preferences towards recycling programs de pendingontheexpectedrecyclingrateandhowmuchitwouldcostthe households to participate in the programs Kipperberg and Larson Some studies indicate that higher fees for waste disposals and the implementation of variable pricing of waste disposal would give peopleincentivetorecyclemoreeg Hongetal Sidiqueetal bHoweverarecentstudyfromNorwayHellerandVatnsuggeststhattheintroductionofeconomicincentivesthroughaweight based fee on waste trigger different responses For some households the scheme encourages them to sort more due to cost saving In other words these households respond positively to the external push broughtaboutbytheeconomicincentiveMeanwhiletheintroduction of economic incentive does not change the degree of sorting done by those households who are selfmotivated that they do not end up sorting more after the introduction of the scheme Heller and Vatn argue that this illustrates that people motivated by environ mental concerns may question the justification of an economic in centiveschemeandasaresulttheschemecanbecounterproductiveArecent study from Italy by Gilli et al shows that the efficacyof policies to promote recycling is very much dependent on individual motivations Another line of research has uncovered the important role of per sonal belief moral aspects social norms and

iscloselyrelatedtothedegreetowhichindividualsperceiverecyclingas their moral obligation that they are doing the right thing for the en vironment and that they hold a sense of personal responsibility for sorting eg Bruvoll et al Berglund Nyborg et al Brekkeetal HellerandVatnForsomeindividualsdoing so is part of maintaining their selfimage Nyborg et al Brekke et al Czajkowski et al Previous research reveals that individuals recycling behaviour is also influenced by views and beha viours with regard to recycling of those within the individuals com munity or social network Individuals are

about their personal recycling responsibility Brekke et al Finally previous studies have reported a number of socioeco nomicdeterminantsofhouseholdwastehandlingbehavioursincluding age income household size and employment eg Hong et al Huhtala Sidique et al a b Kipperberg and Larson Lee et al Methods and data Model specification We use a choice modelling approach to quantify the importance of different factors in households preferences for different waste sorting schemes This follows the same approach as other economic studies analysing households waste sorting and recycling preferences

re spondents preferences for waste sorting and handling alternatives we estimate a Latent Class Model LCM Boxall and Adamowicz Greene and Hensher Train Following the LCM frame
