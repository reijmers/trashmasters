and Conclusions
The circular economy has become a popular new concept, suggesting economic growth with
lower emissions and reduced ownership as some of its key parameters. Based on the literature,
however, it appears that the concept has not been sufﬁciently contested empirically. This study
evaluates the carbon and material footprint implications of reduced ownership in the context of
households. We found that reduced ownership as a feature of CE alone does not automatically reduce
the environmental impact of a production–consumption system. The reduced ownership in the study
did not have any inﬂuence on MF, and in the case of CF, it had only a mildly positive inﬂuence in
low-income households.
