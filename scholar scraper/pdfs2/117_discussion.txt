The results of the tests described in the previous section are reported in Figures 9–13
showing the sound absorption coefﬁcient aand the transmission loss TLobtained by means
of the impedance tube measurements. For each sample, the NRC has been calculated
and reported in Table 2.

Figure 9 shows that, for samples 03 and 22, the most interesting sound insulation
performance was given by sample 22, with a TLfollowing the mass law up to 800 Hz
and then a behavior typical of double walls, with a coincidence frequency around 1800 Hz.
Sample 03 was not able to reach the same performances. As regards the absorption
coefﬁcient, it was characterized by wide peaks at given frequencies due to holes in the egg-
cardboard behaving like Helmholtz resonators. In the case of sample 03, the peak around
700 Hz was very wide due to the presence of sound absorbing polyester ﬁbers inside
the main volume. This result suggests that to reach a good TLit was important to arrange
the egg boxes upside down, but they still had to be coupled with other materials to improve
their performances. The presence of the holes improved the absorption characteristics.
