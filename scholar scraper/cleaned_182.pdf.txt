manufacturing Industry ABSTRACT Zero waste manufacturing ZWM is a concept to support countries transition to a circular economy by devel oping manufacturing technologies and systems that eliminate waste across entire waste value chains to the fullest extent possible through reuse and recycling Implementation of ZWM particularly in dense urban settings such as Singapore presents challenges for stakeholders which stem from issues related to land scarcity productivity and labor shortage A framework to address these challenges is proposed comprising six themes of design for zero waste smart waste audit and reduction planning smart waste collection highvalue mixed waste processing collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis and waste to resource conversion and recycling Asystematic literature review is used to examine industry technologies and research across the six themes to determine how the technologies can support ZWM The research reveals that a variety of mature waste mea surement collection and conversion technologies can be integrated through internetofthings applications anda collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis to support Singapore and other countries in developing a ZWMecosystem This research examines the technical limitations of implementing ZWM technologies in dense urban settings using Singapore as a case study Future areas of research are then proposed to overcome the im plementation barriers so that ZWM can be enabled Introduction Transitioning to a circular economy has drawn signi cant attention from countries across the world as a new pathway for mitigating the growing volumes of waste that is coupled with today s economic growth The predominant linear take make and dispose economic development model has resulted in ine cient use of resources that threatens the stability of natural ecosystems and survival of humanityGhisellini et al More recently the unsustainable nature of the linear economic system has gained even greater attention due toChina s decision in late to implement a ban against imports of categories of waste from the rest the world A year later other countriesin Asia such as India Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam have followed the same initiative by implementing their own waste import bans and tightening restrictions This has forced nations such as the United States the United Kingdom Australia and Japan to urgently rethink their waste management practices Global municipal solid waste MSW generation is estimated at billion tonnes per year and by it isexpected to increase to approximately billion tonnes per year World Bank A majority of the global waste ends up in land lls open dumps oceans or other parts of the environment due to sub optimal waste management systems and low recycling rates around the world Only of global plastic waste was recycled National Geographic while for electronic wastes it was estimated that only of the global total is documented to have been collected and recycled properly Bald et al Strategies are therefore needed that prioritize reducing material consumption levels and break awayfrom conventional waste management in a linear economy and transi tion to a circular economy where wastes are reduced and reused as resources across multiple supply chains at every opportunity Young et al Singapore is working towards becoming a zero waste nation as the country is faced with the similar global challenge of guring out the next destination to put its growing amounts of waste As outlined in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint by the Ministry of the

and Water Resources Government of Singapore As an a uent and highly urbanized country with very little land available for use Singapore is highly reliant on its four wastetoenergy plants to incinerate its nonrecyclable wastes The in cineration bottom ash and nonincinerable wastes are stored at its rst and only o shore land ll on Semakau island Space on Semakau island will quickly disappear as the land ll is expected to max out by a decade sooner than the original projection The population andauence of the citystate is expected to climb which will correspond ingly increase future waste generation As shown in Fig in Singapore generated million tonnes of waste with of the vo lume recycled and either incinerated or sent to a land ll The steady rise in recycling rates from in to in has helped Singapore mitigate waste challenges However the rate ofwaste generated has also increased similarly and the amount of waste sent to the incinerators and land ll has not shown much improvement In parallel to the waste challenges Singapore has prioritized ad vancing its manufacturing sector which contributes to of its gross domestic product GDP and of total employment Ministry of Trade and Industry To advance the manufacturing sector Singapore has adopted industry technologies as a pathway that is ex pected to add USD billion in total manufacturing output boost labor productivity by and create new jobs by Boston Consulting Group Industry is the fourth stage of the industrial revolution where computers automation technologies and manufacturing systems integrate together into cyberphysical systems that monitor the physical processes of a factory and make its own de cisions Zheng et al Lopes de Sousa et al Lee et al The twoway communication of data between the components machines and digital devices results in networked manufacturing sys tems that are intelligently crosslinked across all hierarchical levels of a value chain Stock and Seliger To catalyze the adoption of I the Government of Singapore has committed USD billion under theveyear Research Innovation and Enterprise plan to support advancements of technological capabilities in the manufacturing andengineering sectors National Research Foundation Global ex periences have shown however that although advancements in manufacturing result in rising living standards it also brings about adverse environmental impacts due to unsustainable consumption and pro duction patterns Tseng et al Zero waste manufacturing ZWM o ers a solution to Singapore and other countries waste management and manufacturing objectives The concept focuses on developing manufacturing systems that eliminatewaste across entire value chains to the fullest extent possible byminimizing waste generation and maximizing the use of wastes as resources in other supply chains In ZWM waste is viewed as a manu facturing value chain where waste is generated collected and recycled ZWM aims to improve waste reduction and recovery across multiple supply chains and stakeholders to maximize resource e ciency The holistic life cycle approach of ZWM can address the dual ob jectives of future advancements in manufacturing and waste reduction However an overarching challenge of achieving ZWM is that as global manufacturing moves through the fourth industrial revolution the di versity and volume of waste will continue to evolve and stakeholders along the waste value chain may not be able to keep up at the same pace World Economic Forum To identify the technologies that stakeholders can implement to achieve ZWM this study proposes a holistic framework comprising six technology themes that aim to mitigate waste generation across the life cycle stages of production and consumption systems These six themes include i design for zero waste ii smart waste audit and reduction planning iii smart waste collection iv highvalue mixed waste processing v collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis vi waste to resource conversion and recycling As shown in Fig the six themes of the ZWM framework are connected together by addressing speci c technical needs of stake holders across the manufacturing waste value chain producers who arealso the waste generators waste collectors and waste to resource converters or recyclers The ways in which all six themes support the three major waste value chain stakeholders move towards ZWM is outlined in Table Integrated together the collection of technologies under all six themes can minimize waste along the whole waste value chain The ZWM framework o ers both environmental and economic bene ts for a country s manufacturing sector Implementing technologies under the six themes allows manufacturing companies to reduce the volume of waste generated and prevent waste from entering the land ll Waste reduction and recycling through ZWM reduces greenhouse gas emissions energy consumption and reliance on virgin materials which translates to economic cost savings Previous studies have reviewed how the zero waste concept and dierent technologies have been applied in di erent stages of produc tion and waste management systems Zaman Singh et al However there is a need for studies to examine the technical challenges stakeholders of the waste value chain waste generators waste Fig Waste disposal and recycling in Singapore between and National Environment AgencyP Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling collectors and waste to resource converters may face in implementing existing technologies to meet their zero waste goals and transition to a circular economy Certain ZWM technologies may face barriers during implementation in dense urban settings There is a need to identify the technical challenges waste stakeholders operating in dense urban set tings may face as per capita waste generation is greater for countries or regions with high urbanization rates World Bank and it is projected that more than twothirds of the world s population will be residing in urban centers by United Nations The objectiveof this research is to therefore answer the questions what are the latest industry technologies under each theme of ZWM and what are the challenges that hinder implementation of these technologies to achieve the goals of ZWM in Singapore and other highly urbanized regions around the world This study rst used a systematic review approach to identify and review the stateoftheart technologies and research literature under the six themes of the ZWM framework Based on the thematic review the feasibility of implementing the technologies is examined using Singapore as a case study for a high income and highly Fig Overview of zero waste manufacturing framework Table Stakeholder bene ts under each theme of

more easily into subcomponents and materials so that they can be separated to facilitate e cient recycling Smart waste audit and reduction planningGenerators Automated waste auditing and reporting processes can e ciently estimate the magnitude and composition of waste generated to provide the necessary data for managing and mitigating waste Collectors Data from smart waste audits can be used by waste collectors to know the magnitude and type of waste di erent entities are generating in real time and therefore know where and when to collect a speci c type of waste that is desired Converters Dierent waste to resource converters can use smart waste audits for realtime information about the magnitude and type of waste being generated at di erent sites and then quickly identify who to engage with to use the speci c waste Smart waste collection Generators Being connected to a smart waste collection system with sensors and smart waste bins allows waste generators tohave their wastes collected more e ciently and avoids unmanageable waste over ow Collectors Data from smart waste collection systems help optimize waste collection routes that maximize the number of fullbins collected

information about when wastes will arrive at their facilities which can support in planning recycling operations and predict incoming materials Highvalue mixed waste processing Generators Automated sorting and segregation allow for recovery of valuable materials from waste generators that was disposedin a single mixed stream due to lack of capacity or infrastructure to do source separation Collectors Waste collectors can collect mixed waste streams and have it sorted to recover materials that can then be sent toother facilities for waste to resource conversion Converters Automated sorting and segregation of mixed wastes before recycling increases waste to resource conversion yields Collaborative platform for industrial symbiosisGenerators Waste generators can be matched with companies that desire their wastes for reuse or recycling Collectors Collectors can become logistic service providers for companies connected on a collaborative platform for waste toresource matching and exchanges Data from the collaborative platform can identify for collectors where theirservices may be needed Converters The collaborative platform can provide information to waste to resource converters about which companies have thewaste that speci c converters desire for reuse and recycling Waste to resource conversion and recyclingGenerators Waste generators will have technology options for recovering value from their waste materials instead of disposing itto a land ll or incinerator Collectors Collectors can provide the service of delivering wastes to the appropriate waste to resource converter Converters Converters will have the technology needed to convert waste to resources and then sell the recycled materials as afeedstock for another supply chainP Kerdlap et al

achieve both manufacturing and waste management goals in Singapore and similar cities The secondary questions developed that support the primary question were How do the technologies under each theme contribute to achieving ZWM What future areas of research should be pursued to address the limitations of the technologies identi ed under the themes of the ZWM framework Locating studies Two decisions were made in the selection of the search engines and the keywords Scopus and ScienceDirect were used to identify scienti c papers related to the six themes of ZWM Scopus was selected because itis the largest citation and abstract database while ScienceDirect was selected because the database contains many of the journals with stu dies that are related to the topics being explored in this review The general Google search engine was also used to nd grey literature sources such as business reports news articles and company information about technologies and businesses related to the ZWM themes thathave already been implemented in the global market Search keywords were determined through a twostep process First the six ZWM themes were used in the search engines Then related concepts

Stateoftheart technologies in zero waste manufacturing Each theme of ZWM addresses a group of technologies needed for waste generators waste collectors and waste to resource converters to move towards ZWM Through the thematic review technologies areidentied that the ZWM stakeholders could adopt to overcome their unique waste management challenges An excel spreadsheet that classies the ZWM technologies and studies reviewed in this research is provided in the supporting information Design for zero waste Design for zero waste focuses on designing products that use less materials andor are easier to disassemble This reduces the amount of waste generated makes it easier to collect used parts and makes it more feasible to recover parts or materials from the product at its end of life In the manufacturing industry design for disassembly DfD and additive manufacturing AM are able to achieve this goal DfD is a design strategy that considers the future need to disassemble a product for repair refurbishment and recycling Through DfD valuable parts and materials that still have value can be easily recovered and used in the same or di erent products AM technology constructs products by directly joining materials layer by layer following a digital designtemplate AM products can be developed to more precise design spe cications and shapes from start to nish which helps eliminate waste generated along the manufacturing process compared to conventionalmanufacturing Design for disassembly Ameliorating product design during the development phase can increase the recovery rate of products and their materials DfD guide lines state that maximizing a product s ability to be disassembled can be achieved during the design stage by looking at how to reduce thenumber of product parts lower product disassembly costs shorten disassembly time and solve all the existing problems in disassembly Soh et al For DfD products to be successful and well received by customers it is recommended that they meet di erent char acteristics provided by Wang et al To support decisionmaking in DfD Low et al proposed a tool based on modular product architecture Products with modular architectures are a notable example of DfD because they can be disassembled into a number of subassembliesparts and components Each subassembly can be considered a module that can be independently created and then used

standardized building blocks which can be rearranged to create di erent con gurations and variants Rios et al Parts of modular products are also easily replaceable One ex ample of a modular product is Hewlett Packard s HPZ computer as illustrated in Fig The HPZ monitor contains all the machine s workings and all hardware components can be removed for repair without the need fortools Ellen MacArthur Foundation Modular construction of buildings has been shown to achieve the benets of DfD Modular buildings make it easier to deconstruct them and recover the materials for other product supply chains as opposed tocompletely demolishing them Kamali et al Kamali and Hewage The company Yorkon manufactures modular components of buildings o site and connects all the pieces of the nal building at the determined location as shown in Fig Modular construction does not necessarily restrict the nished de sign and can save money and time due to less disruption and wastesgenerated compared to onsite construction of a building from scratchKamali and Hewage Additive manufacturing AM technology produces objects from a threedimensional D model by joining materials layer by layer directly from raw materialssuch as metal and plastic in powder liquid sheet or lament form without the need for molds tools or dies AM builds products to moreprecise design speci cations which reduces waste material generatedduring product fabrication compared to traditional manufacturing Niaki et al D printing is the most wellknown type of AM that allows products to be engineered to a speci c order from the customer and spareparts can be produced to precise speci cations Kreiger et al D printed products are more exible in terms of customization capabilities This enables manufacturing to happen outside of a factory and closer to the point where the product will be consumed Kellens et al Some multinational companies have invested in AM forenhancing their business General Electric invested USD million in a factory that D prints fuel nozzles each year because AM technology uses less material than conventional manufacturing pro cesses which reduces production costs Massachusetts Institute of Technology Several shoe companies such as Adidas Nike Feetzand United Nude are now using D printing technology to give cus tomers shoes that are custom made for them right at the store CNN D printed shoes use the exact amount of materials required and can help avoid generation of waste materials that typically occurs in conventional shoe production Design for zero waste contributes to building a ZWM ecosystem because it helps prevent waste generation right at the start of product life cycles Making products that are easier to disassemble re manufacture and refurbish increases opportunities for products andtheir components to be reused in the same or di erent product life cycle Conducting research to advance design for zero waste will support product reuse upgrade and maintenance resulting in reduced consumption of raw materials and energy Smart waste audit and reduction planning Smart waste audits comprise hardware and software solutions that analyze waste volumes automatically segregate waste and assess op portunities for waste reduction and diversion though recycling or reuse Current hardware research and development has been focused on waste bins that automatically segregate waste by analyzing the material content through cameras and sensors Bine CleanRobotics On the software side smart waste audits are carried out through online tools that use data analytics to review waste generation data existing waste collection practices and costs and current levels of onsite recycling Ng et al These digital tools then identify opportu nities for increasing waste recycling and cost saving opportunitiesGershman Brickner Bratton Inc GBB developed an internetbased tool called Smart Engine that identi es costsaving opportunities for dierent workplaces The tool utilizes an extensive database of waste and recycling information from GBB s years of experience in the industry and national databases After the tool was developed andtested many businesses conducted their waste audits through Smar tEngine Gershman Brickner and Bratton Inc SMARTWaste is another online smart waste auditing tool developed by BRE This toolwas designed to simplify reporting for environmental compliance in construction projects by managing environmental data in construction and allows users to input the data from their projects Users have re ported that SMARTWaste helped reduce onsite waste generation by BRE Smart waste audits and reduction planning technologies contribute to building a ZWM ecosystem because they enable waste audits to be carried out more e ciently Advanced hardware and software solutions for collecting and analyzing waste generation data at di erent sites reduce the time and costs to complete waste audits and measure the potential for waste reduction and recycling Smart waste collection Current trends in smart waste collection have resulted from new technology enablers that include geographic information systems GIS data access networks sensors and InternetofThings IoT Shukla and Shukla The global smart waste collection technology market is Fig Internal design of the HP Z computer Fig Example of a modular building by Yorkon Ellen

solutions for smart waste collection areBigbelly Solar Cognito Tech Solutions Compology Ecube Labs Enevo IoTsens SmartBin SmartUp Cities System Level Solutions Urbiotica and WAVIoT Modern smart waste collection systems include an integrated net work of sensors smart waste bins trucks maps and a data manage ment center all integrated together to maximize e ciency of waste collection Srikantha They are designed to solve the current complicated and costly process composed of ine cient routes serviced by aeet of trucks on disconnected and arbitrary schedules Ecube Labs a As a result collection costs can represent nearly two thirds of waste management expenditures Gershman Brickner and Bratton Inc In smart waste collection systems sensors are set up at waste bins connected to a remote network The sensors measurebinll levels and send the data to a central database that uses data analytics to monitor sensors and optimize collection routes by skippingempty or low tra c bins Gutierrez et al Algorithms are then used to conduct predictive analyses of data history to estimate ll levels in advance The results are then used to plan out optimized collection routes for waste hauling trucks that minimize pickup points and the number of vehicles dispatched Collection routes are sent to truck dri vers through a mobile phone application in real time and can be up dated by GPS navigation The parameterization of the multitude of factors such as distances between points facility options and proces sing costs is necessary to accurately model the complexities of multi plicities and spatial heterogeneities in municipal solid waste systems Cheng et al a bFig illustrates components of a smart waste collection system The fundamental component of smart bins are sensors that can be attached to any type of waste bin and continuously measure ll level temperature and bin tilt using ultrasonic wireless technology Sensorsare also capable of detecting all types of solid and liquid materials such as general waste glass waste oil and lubricants They can also perform geopositional tracking to ensure that owners always know the location of their containers Omar et al Wireless ultrasonic sensors also serve as a communication node that send waste bin information to acentral data server through a cellular network Future sensor tech nology will be able to measure humidity motion or weight of the bin to provide better data about the composition of waste at di erent sites Other larger and more complex smart waste bins exist that provideservices beyond ll level monitoring and wireless data transfer One example is the Bigbelly smart bin as shown in Fig The bin is powered by solar photovoltaic electricity can compact waste within the receptacle to reduce volume and over ow and is equipped with a WiFi unit that can serve as a public internet hotspot Bigbelly The waste compacting feature helps reduce the col lection trips needed to empty the bin More advanced smart bins are being built with capabilities to automatically sort waste deposited into the bin which would reduce labor time and costs in waste manage ment Bine This waste sorting function is based on a combi nation of mechanical and electronical components and software withelements of arti cial intelligence Data systems in smart waste collection monitor and optimize daily selection of waste bins to be emptied and calculate the routes and schedules accordingly Powered by information and communicationstechnology infrastructure data about bin ll level locations of bins and trucks road tra c congestion time of day and other factors are col lected from all smart waste bins Algorithms then process this data to calculate the most e cient collection routes to be taken Ecube Labs a The data system then transmits the optimized collection routes directly to the drivers mobile phone or tablet computer These online tools enable managers of smart waste collection systems to monitor alloperations in real time from either a desktop computer or remotely on a mobile device Smart waste collection online tools are designed to learn Fig Components of a smart waste collection system Gutierrez et al Fig Bigbelly smart waste binP Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling from experience and can make decisions based not only on the daily waste level status but also on future waste forecasts tra c congestion balanced coste ciency functions and other factors that humans are unable to foresee The advanced data systems in smart waste collection enable optimized selection of trashcans to be collected which improves collection e ciency and reduces operation costs Many cities across the world have already implemented smart waste collection systems in urban management programs in tandem with IoT technology advancements GreenBiz Companies such as Ecube Labs and Bigbelly Solar have already successfully deployed their smartwaste collection systems technologies at universities city streets train stations and airports in Dublin Los Angeles Melbourne Seoul and Washington DC Bigbelly Ecube Labs b These projects have resulted in waste collection cost savings as high as Smart waste collection technologies contribute to building a ZWM ecosystem because waste producers collectors and converters becomedigitally connected to enhance waste management operations Waste management assets such as collection trucks are able to perform more eciently because they can be dispatched along a route with bins at ll levels that are maxed out or near maximum capacity as opposed todriving through a collection route with bins at low ll levels Data from smart waste management systems and their components can be used tocreate strategies that identify the best route and time of day during the week that is best for collection This reduces the amount of labor trucks deployed and fuel required to carry out waste collection operations Ecient collection of recyclables through smart waste collection sys tems will also enable more conversion of waste to resources for othersupply chains Highvalue mixed waste processing Mixed waste processing MWP uses a combination of new and existing technologies at large facilities to sort out the recyclables from streams of mixed waste The goal of highvalue MWP is to achieve greater yields of recycled products that are valuable for endusers One of the greatest challenges in achieving highvalue MWP is developing technology that processes single streams of mixed waste and segregates products with very minimal contamination in a coste ective manner Overall the MWP industry is moving towards large regional singlestream facilities as opposed to smallscale operations Gershman Brickner and Bratton Inc Modern MWP facilities are mature and employ demonstrated technology for processing MSW and cap turing recyclables Nearly all modern MWP facilities include a presort to eliminate bulky or prohibitive materials a method to open bags and screens that remove ne materials Gershman Brickner and Bratton Inc Advancements in MWP are expected to be primarily focused on improvements in identi cation and segregation technologies such as op tical sensors that can target and separate speci c plastics Optical units in modern material recovery facilities MRFs are mostly used to re cover polyethylene terephthalate PET and highdensity polyethylene HDPE However optical units can also be used to recover other re cyclable mixed plastics frequently referred to as plastics grade through Table provides details about stateoftheart technologies used across all processes for MWP Combining MRFs and MWP systems have potential to signi cantly increase both volume and total revenue from recycling materialsGershman Brickner and Bratton Inc Routing MRF residue to the MWP facility could allow for greater potential of reprocessing andrecovery of recyclables The MWP facility could also serve as the consolidation point for all the nonrecovered material output streams which would improve e ciency This would allow the MRF to still recover high quality recyclables while the MWP facility would recoveradditional recyclables of adequate quality Highvalue MWP contributes to building a ZWM ecosystem by in creasing recovery rates of valuable materials from mixed waste streamsand reduces the magnitude of waste sent to the land ll Increasing MWP allows for greater segregation of waste that can be reused as re sources in other supply chains Even after residents have separated out recycled commodities the average MSW stream may contain up to half of the total volume of recyclables and in many cases more than half Conducting research to improve highvalue MWP will help reduce fu ture land ll costs The costs of land lling waste will only rise due to the rapidly declining availability of land ll space Another bene t of im proving highvalue MWP is that the technology does not require con sumer participation education or sorting behavior Collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis Collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis are an ongoing eld of research focused on developing digital technologies that identify suitable waste to resource matches and facilitates those exchanges be tween di erent companies in a speci c area or region Fraccascia and Yazan This promotes industrial symbiosis an association be tween two or more industrial facilities or companies where wastes and byproducts of one supply chain become resources for another These platforms function similarly to social networking platforms such as LinkedIn Uber and Airbnb where people s demands are matched with supplies of resources and products Currently several internetbasedplatforms exist that facilitate industrial symbiosis Industry organiza tions or facilitator companies usually o er these internetbased plat form tools that allow businesses to discuss synergies through symbiosisin a safe and common environment Chertow and Park Plat forms that are commercialized or under development usually include aninterface where users input data about the waste and resources they have available or desire a database for storing all the information about the dierent users and companies and algorithms for matching dif ferent users based on their waste and resource needs Low et al Raabe et al Song et al Table provides details that distinguish each of the di erent existing collaborative platforms de signed to facilitate industrial symbiosis Expected future development of these platforms include software upgrades that use advanced data analytics and models to perform automated waste recycle and reuse matches This would allow human labor to focus on veri cation and supervision instead of timecon suming research and analysis Research is being done to upgrade theseplatforms to enable material informatics This uses data mining and machine learning processes to analyze large ensembles of primary and waste material data to deliver the knowledge to endusers that require them for product development Ramakrishna et al Another area of research for this technology is development of analytical toolsthat calculate the environmental and economic bene ts of the potential waste to resource exchanges and material processing systems using lifecycle assessment Jose and Ramakrishna Future research is also being done to digitally connect all stakeholders involved in ZWM andhave them interact on a cyberphysical environment as illustrated in Fig A collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis contributes to building a ZWM ecosystem because these online platforms provide the necessary intelligence to connect all types of organizations to trade wastes and byproducts between each other in an economically favor able manner Manufacturing companies usually lack the knowledge about what kind of wastes can be converted into resources Even if the companies have the technical capacity in this area practical concernsarise such as the business viability and the willingness of companies to become partners to carry out waste to resource exchangesCollaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis can catalyze ZWM by providing greater knowledge about which waste and byproducts can be recaptured in other product supply chains which reduces waste generation and primary resource consumptionP Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling Waste to resource conversion and recycling Food waste to energy Mature technologies for converting food waste to energy uses bio logical thermal and thermochemical reactions to yield products that can be used as raw energy Anaerobic digestion and fermentation are the biological processes employed Thermal and thermochemical pro cesses use incineration pyrolysis gasi cation hydrothermal oxidation Pham et al The e ciency of food waste to energy conversion technologies is strongly reliant on pretreatment and quality of waste Table lists the energy products and byproduct of each food waste to energy technology Each class of food waste to energy conversion technology has its own bene ts and challenges Anaerobic digestion has been successfully commercialized to generate biogas from food waste However it is challenged by the duration of conversion since it can take days for the microbial reaction to be completed Pham et al Fer mentation has demonstrated itself to be a technically feasible processfor producing ethanol from food waste However the overall economic viability of fermentation needs further research to determine ways to reduce the costs of converting food waste to ethanol Waste incineration with heat recovery has been used to deal with food waste but there are few studies that provide consistent information about the amount of energy recovered from incinerating food waste Furthermore food waste is not wellsuited for incineration because of its high moisturecontent and contains noncombustible components Food waste that isincinerated is usually in the general ow of MSW and is not treated in a separate group Pyrolysis and gasi cation are complex thermal pro cesses involving chemical and physical interactions that take place at temperatures above degrees Celsius in an oxygenfree environmentPham et al The syngas gas produced can be burned directly or be used as fuel for gas engines and turbines or be used as feedstock forproducing chemicals such as methanol Similar to incineration the specic properties of the solid waste can signi cantly a ect the waste to energy gasi cation process To date there are not any gasi cation and pyrolysis processes that can solely deal with food waste Hydrothermal carbonization has received more research attention because it can deal with waste streams with moisture content as high as Hydro thermal carbonization uses a wet process to convert food wastes to ahigh value energyrich resource under autogenous pressure and low temperatures of to degrees Celsius The energyrich resource often called hydrochar is sterile hygienic and is easy to store and transport It has been reported that the highly carbonized and energy rich material has a composition equivalent to that of lignite coal Berge et al Hydrothermal carbonization technology therefore o ers an ecient way of converting a wide variety of food wastes without the need for an energyintensive drying process which is a common requirement in other food waste to energy technologiesTable Stateoftheart technologies used at MWP facilities Gershman Brickner and Bratton Inc Technology Type of equipment used and process carried out Conveyors Rubber and metal belts are used to move materials to and from processing equipment sort stations and to nal storage Modern conveyors include belt cleaning mechanisms that remove ne and wet materials that tend to stay on the belt Bag openers Mechanical parts that release materials from closed plastic trash bags without resizing or changing the contents Most designs of bag openers allow large and unbreakable objects to pass through by exiting spring loads or other mechanisms without jamming the bag breaker Primary shredders Hammermills grinders and highspeed shredders are used to reduce the size of the waste The downside to hammermills is that they create a lot of dust andnes and do not work as well on materials such as plastic lm that does not shear or break easily Secondary shredders Secondary shredders are used only when additional size reduction of mixed waste is needed such as in the production of materials for refusedderived fuel densi cation or other processes Types of secondary shredders are highspeed high inertia hammermills mediumspeed single rotor shredders and lowspeed shear shredders with multiple shafts and are almost always used in conjunction with primary size reduction Screens Mechanically separate materials by size Types of screens include vibratory screens trommel screens disc screens and ballistic screens Each screen agitates and spreads out materials to break up loosely bound items and separate smaller items from larger ones Ferrous magnets Types of magnets currently used are belt magnets head pulley magnets and drum magnets The belt magnet consists of a cleated rubber belt that travels between two nonmagnetic pulleys over a central magnet that can either be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet Head pulley magnets are permanent magnets set up as the head pulley of a conveyor Drum magnets have nonmagnetic steel covers that rotate about xed internal permanent or electromagnets Nonferrous magnets Eddy current separator units are commonly used as a nonferrous magnet to separate nonferrous metals such as aluminum and copper from a stream of materials Air separation systems Air drum separators remove heavy or light items from the material stream or to occasionally split highvolume streams into similar composition fractions Optical sorting systems Optical sorting systems use nearinfrared light and sensors to recognize di erent plastics at processing plans The technology uses light to illuminate the material stream and sensors that collect the re ected or transmitted light to analyze the light properties using spectrometry The spectrometry reveals the wavelengths that are re ected by the objects Densication systems Densi cation compacts resulting material streams from an MWP facility into a smaller more transportable form that can be easily stored These transportable forms include balers for recovered plastics and ber or a residue compactor that presses the residue stream into a container The two types of balers commonly used at MWP facilities are singleram and doubleram Table Collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis

Recycling Paper and cardboard Commercialized paper and cardboard recycling technologies and processes are similar across the world The main di erence between regions countries and cities is the manner in which waste paper and cardboard is collected to the recycling facilities The current practice starts with shredding collected recycled paper in pulpers and then mixing the bres with water and chemicals which are then heated into a slurry mix Misman et al Contaminants are then removed from the slurry mix and the mix is then put onto a conveyor belt toallow the bres to bond together Heated metal rollers then dry the paper which is then made into large rolls for new paper products Dueto dierent grades of paper there is a limited amount of times that paper can be recycled The length of paper bers become shorter after every round of recycling which reduces its grade Advancements in paper and cardboard recycling technology can be achieved through improvements in process e ciency at factories ABB This en tails reductions in energy and chemical use at all stages of the recyclingprocess through increasing the use of heat recovery cogeneration self generated biomass fuel e cient motors and e cient steam use Plastics Plastic recycling is currently done at large centralized facilities that take advantage of economies of scale in producing lowvalue productsThere is strong demand for recycled plastic from manufacturing com panies because recycled materials are a preferred choice for cost re duction and reducing waste Stateoftheart plastic recycling processes can be categorized under four di erent classes as shown in Fig Primary recycling is commonly known as reextrusion and can onlyhandle clean or semiclean scrap plastic after the contaminated parts are sorted out This makes MSW not suitable for primary recycling because of high contamination Secondary recycling uses screw extru sion injection moulding and blow moulding to transform plastic ma terials through mechanical means into low value products The pro cesses involved in secondary recycling include cutting and shredding separating contaminants and separating akes by oating The nal recycled plastic product is stored and then resold after pigments and other additives have been added Plastic strands are then extruded further to make pellets based on the requirements and then the nal products are manufactured Tertiary recycling uses various methodssuch as pyrolysis cracking gasi cation and chemolysis to recycle plastic materials by recovering monomers from plastic solid wastethrough depolymerization Tertiary recycling can be separated into two types of techniques chemical and thermal recycling Quaternary re cycling incinerates plastic waste that has already gone through primary secondary and tertiary recycling to recover energy This method is only done when there is no other way to dispose plastic waste that is no longer valuable in other supply chains Incineration of plastic waste emits harmful air pollutants such as carbon dioxide nitrous oxides sulfur dioxide volatile organic compounds particulate matter parti culatebound heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons poly chlorinated dibenzofurans and dioxins Recycled plastic materials can be used in a variety of products to replace ceramic wood and metals because plastics are very functional hygienic light and economical Recycled plastics are typically used to make new plastic bottles containers bags and clothing materials Another application of recycled plastic is in manufacturing plastic Fig

park benches and outdoor decking Plastic lumber mostly uses HDPE LDPE and PP as the feedstock Another application of recycled plastic is in producing plastic lament for D printing Several companies have developed machines that are able to shred andgrind postconsumer plastic speci cally HDPE which is then melted extruded and then spooled into the plastic lament D printers then use the lament to make new plastic products The variety of applica tions available for recycled plastic material drives the demand to collectand recycle postconsumer plastic through the di erent conversion methods Electronic waste Waste electrical and electronic equipment also known as ewaste has become a pressing environmental problem globally due to the rapid uptake of electrical and electronic equipment by consumers In global ewaste generation reached million metric tonnes and only was recycled Bald et al Asia generated the most ewaste followed by Europe the Americas Africa and Oceana The biggestchallenge is that a majority of ewaste is not tracked and documented adequately and waste equipment is not recycled or treated properly E waste recycling is currently driven by prevention of hazardous heavy metals from damaging ecosystems and human health and capturing precious metals such as copper steel aluminum and gold Traditional ewaste recycling starts with manual disassembly and separation of the dierent components Then the components are categorized into parts that can be reused or need to be further processed for recycling Partsthat are unable to be disassembled are then sent through size reduction processes removal of dust and debris and then separation of metallic contents through magnets Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes are currently practiced in industry to extract valuable metals from ewastePyrometallurgical processes extract metals by directly burning ewaste in a blast furnace resulting in a product with black copper by weight The black copper is then put through a converter to be oxidizedand then reduced in an anode furnace Afterwards the copper anode produced is further puri ed in a sulfuric acid electrolyte with other elements such as nickel zinc and iron An issue with pyrometallurgicalrecovery is that huge amounts of wastewater and residues are producedwhich can cause serious pollution if the wastes are not handled prop erly Furthermore it is hard to recover metals other than copper through incineration and nonmetallic materials cannot be recycled during the process In hydrometallurgy strong acids such as HNO HCl or HClO are commonly used as leaching solvents to extract metals such as copper lead and zinc from ewaste Cyanide leaching has also been done to extract gold from ewaste components The challenge with these traditional methods of incineration and acid leaching is that the processes have low metal recovery rates and the chemicals used and wastes produced are hazardous to human health and the environment More advanced methods of ewaste recycling exist that can achieve higher metal recovery rates lower costs and resource inputs and re duce impacts to the environment and human health Zhang and Xu The challenges of some advanced methods are that they are still immature and have only shown successful results at the lab or pilot level and have high investment costs The processes inputs and pro ducts extracted through di erent methods of ewaste recycling are summarized in Table Remanufacturing Remanufacturing is another form of waste to resource conversion that focuses on bringing used products back to original or better conditions Center for Remanufacturing and Reuse Products that are easy to disassemble enable e cient remanufacturing Steps in the remanufacturing process are illustrated in Fig Most remanufactured products are required to pass a set of quality standards before they are resent out for sale Companies around the world that conduct remanufacturing activities are listed in Table Remanufacturing has been an undervalued part of the sustainable industries landscape with activities promoted only on a sectorbysector basis The prices of remanufactured products are also typically lower compared to the cost of a new product Centre for Remanufacturing and Reuse The European Remanufacturing Network conducted a Remanufacturing Market Study to estimate the level of remanufacturing in the European Union and understand the barriers that need to be addressed to advance remanufacturing Countries covered in this landscape review were Brazil China Fig Classication of plastic waste recycling methods Singh et al P Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling Denmark India Japan South Korea Malaysia Singapore United Kingdom and United States European Commission From the study the major challenges of remanufacturing identi ed were Logistics chain Costly and complicated collection of cores Compliance with quality requirements Costly to ensure the quality of remanufactured products Longterm investment Cost intensive research and development is required for remanufacturing and has a long payback period thatcan be too risky for some companies Too much transparency Remanufacturing requires cooperation be tween suppliers and customers as well as an open value chain This can give competitors an advantage and increase espionage Sales versus leasing To counter customers skepticism of re manufactured products some companies lease their products to the customers The inability to lease some product types was seen to be a potential barrier Complex with seemingly overlapping authorities and contradictory regulations from governments have deterred remanufacturing progress in certain countries In middle income or developing countries the remanufacturing sector is largely unregulated quality varies and counterfeiting is common Advancing research and implementation of technologies for re cycling food paper cardboard plastic ewaste and other postconsumer products contributes to building a ZWM ecosystem by increasing the amount of waste recovered for use as resources in other supplychains and reduces reliance on virgin materials in manufacturing Greater waste to resource conversion also reduces stress on the limited landll capacity in di erent countries and also reduces the amount of waste shipped abroad for disposal Discussion Integrating ZWM technologies The review of stateoftheart industry technologies and research revealed that there are many technology options that waste value chain stakeholders in Singapore and other countries can adopt to achieve ZWM Applications of InternetofThings IoT technologies was found in the review to be an enabling factor for connecting di erent stake holders along the waste value chain IoT is the connection of all technologies to the internet and to each other that builds o cloud com puting and networks of sensors that continuously collect and monitordata Devices in IoT are not limited to smartphones but also include everyday equipment such as co ee makers washing machines house hold lighting vehicles and cash registers Risteska Stojkoska and Trivodaliev IoT has risen due to swift expansion of basic and aordable internet access and growth in smartphone adoption Smart waste collection systems demonstrated the application of IoT in cities through the use of the internet to connect sensors smart bins waste hauling trucks and the waste management system IoT technologies are also applicable to collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis This is because data covering

Singapore Applying the ZWM framework introduced in this study can help decisionmakers explore the technology options that can improve waste reduction in manufacturing and increase reuse sorting collection and recycling along the entire waste value chain However there are several limitations existing ZWM technologies may face during implementation in the manufacturing and waste management sectors in dense urbancities such as Singapore This section brie y revisits Singapore s man ufacturing and waste management sectors and discusses the practicalfeasibility of implementing the technologies reviewed under the ZWM themes Based on the barriers identi ed in implementing ZWM tech nologies future areas of research are recommended to help Singaporeand other dense urban regions overcome them to transition to a circulareconomy Manufacturing and waste management sectors Similar to many other nations and cities across the world Singapore seeks to transition to a circular economy to meet their national zero waste goals while also advancing its manufacturing sector to boost economic growth Singapore s manufacturing sector is dominated by the key industry clusters of electronics chemicals biomedical scienceslogistics and transport engineering that contribute to of the country s GDP Enterprise Singapore Singapore is globally ranked as the fourth largest exporter of hightech goods and many leading multinational companies across di erent industrial sectors have chosen Singapore as a strategic manufacturing hub Economic Development Board of Singapore In terms of sustainability the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology operates a Sustainable Manufacturing Centre that assists companies in Singapore improve energy water and material e ciency and waste reduction across their entire manufacturing supply chain using both hardware and softwaresolutions Singapore currently operates a wellorganized waste collection and disposal system to manage waste generated across all economic activ ities but it still requires improvements to boost its overall recycling rate Wastes are collected by four public waste collector companies which are Colex Environmental Pte Ltd SembWaste Pte Ltd Veolia ES Singapore Pte Ltd and Super Waste Management Pte Ltd Waste collection in Singapore is divided into six regions of which the four companies are responsible for managing separately The waste collected are sent to sorting facilities where recyclables are separated and the rest is sent to Singapore s four wastetoenergy incineration plants The incineration ash and waste deemed unrecyclable are sent to SemakauLandll fornal disposal Singapore s main goal in becoming a zero waste nation is to increase its recycling rate to by from its current rate of Today about of waste generated in Singapore is incinerated and of waste generated is sent to the land ll As shown in Fig paper and cardboard plastic and food were the waste streams with the highest volumes but lowest recycling rates As a result paper and cardboard plastic and food waste as well as electronic wastes have become the target waste streams to be addressed in Singapore s Zero Waste Masterplan that is undergoing public con sultation MEWR a b One large scale project the Government of Singapore has invested in to improve waste management is develop ment of an integrated waste management facility IWMF that is ex pected to start operating in The key waste streams to be handled at the IWMF are incinerable wastes at tonnesday household recyclables at tonnesday food waste at tonnesday and de watered sludge at tonnesday National Environment Agency of Singapore b To address ewastes the Government of Singapore will implement extended producer responsibility system to cover ve categories which are information and communications technology such as mobile phones and computers solar panels batteries lamps and large household appliances such as refrigerators airconditioners washing machines and dryers NEA a Implementation barriers of ZWM technologies Opportunities exist to reduce waste generation and recover value from the high volumes of waste sent to the incinerator but several barriers need to be overcome with regards to the feasibility of tech nologies reviewed under the ZWM themes Speci c technologies under the ZWM themes face fewer implementation barriers compared toothers in Singapore to help transition to a circular economy In thetheme of design for zero waste the feasibility of design for disassembly to impact existing products consumed in Singapore

gain from using prefabricated pre nished volumetric construction technology is improvement in productivity by HDB and reduced waste generation from construction reduced noise and dust at the construction site and fewer incidences of wet construction joints all while having a higher quality home Using modular construction is expected to increase costs by about but the higher construction costs will be oset by manpower savings Channel NewsAsia Implementation of additive manufacturing technology in Singapore is being actively researched and developed National Research Foundation which will reduce generation of waste plasticsconstruction materials and metals as well as improve energy e ciency in manufacturing processes in Singapore Individual products designedfor disassembly are feasible to produce in Singapore due to the country capabilities in highperformance manufacturing technology Howevereven if products designed for disassembly are produced in Singapore the waste reduction bene ts within the country would be dependent on whether a majority of those products are used in Singapore or exportedabroad As shown in Table an analysis of Singapore s input output tables the latest dataset publicly available reveals that ofthe goods and services households in Singapore consumed from the manufacturing sector were imported from abroad Singapore Department of Statistics At the product group level over of the food products consumed in Singapore are imported from overseas AgriFood and VeterinaryAuthority of Singapore Therefore although Singapore is highly capable of manufacturing products designed for disassembly the waste reduction bene ts would be limited in the case where an overwhelming majority of households in Singapore consume products imported fromabroad that are not designed for disassembly instead of equivalent products designed for disassembly and manufactured in Singapore Smart waste audit and reduction technologies are feasible to im plement on the software side for waste data management and bench marking However the physical process of waste data collection is the technical barrier that needs to be overcome Unlike countries such as Japan the US and the UK that typically sort their wastes on site through specialized bins a majority of postconsumer waste generated in Singapore s residential and commercial premises is commingled and therefore highly heterogenous in composition Stateoftheart smartwaste bins are able to measure the overall volume of waste generated but they lack the ability to measure the volumes of waste by material type which is information that is more valuable for detailed waste reduction planning Countries and other dense urban centers such as Singapore require hardware technologies that are able to e ciently measure the volume of waste generated and estimate its materialcomposition Smart waste collection technologies have been highly feasible to implement in Singapore s waste collection system One of Singapore s four public waste collectors Super has already implemented smartwaste collection sensors at its compacters in bin centers in the towns of Tampines and Pasar Ris Channel NewsAsia The NEA has stated Fig Volume of waste disposed and recycled in Singapore in Table Private consumption of goods and services in Singapore Sector Domestic Imports Domestic and Imports Domestic share Import share Manufacturing Utilities Construction Other goods Wholesale and retail trade transportation and storage Accommodation and food services Information and communications Finance and insurance Business services Other services Total Values in billion US dollarsP Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling that the new smart waste collection systems have improved e ciency and will not result in increases in domestic waste collection fees Fur thermore NEA will progressively roll out smart waste collection system through public waste collection companies by the end of Smart waste bins have not faced technical barriers in implementation Many commercial premises in Singapore have already set up smart waste bins Big Belly Solar The feasibility of implementing technologies for highvalue mixed waste processing has not been an issue in Singapore since the country currently has several material recovery facilities operating which have helped the country maintain its recycling rate at However the remaining of mixed waste that is not recycled is of very low quality and as a result it is sent to the incinerators Increasing the quality of the remaining of mixed waste is necessary to increase the overall re cycling rate As shown in Fig Singapore provides blue bins for re sidents to mix together all recyclables Similar to other countries around the world many nonrecyclable materials are often mixed in with the recyclables in Singapore whichcauses contamination According to the NEA of waste disposed in bins is contaminated and is not recoverable for recycling Channel NewsAsia b In residential settings waste chutes are provided where residents are able to conveniently mix all wastes in a bag and throw it away MEWR a b Although this practice enables an ecient waste collection system it increases contamination of mate rials that are then no longer recoverable for recycling Research is therefore needed to determine methods or technologies that wouldprevent contamination of recyclable waste streams Smaller scalesorting facilities that are suitable for dense urban and residential areas that consumers can conveniently access would be able to reduce the amount of recyclable materials that get sent to the incinerator due to contamination Collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis face few technical barriers for implementation in Singapore This technology relies pri marily on digital systems and would require minimal to nearly no changes in physical infrastructure to implement Yeo et al Many sharing economybased services are already actively used inSingapore and so a similar digital platform focused on waste to resource matching and exchanges between individuals and companies is tech nically feasible One of the challenges that may arise during the initial stages of implementation would be achieving a critical mass of users for the collaborative platform to successfully facilitate industrial symbiosis exchanges The impact on Singapore s waste management system through implementing collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosiswould be a reduction in the amount of waste materials that get mixed in with waste sent to incinerators Instead users would be directly mat ched to a market where their waste could be recycled to gain value and not need to rely on the existing waste collection and recycling system Singapore s severe lack of land space for development presents a major limitation in feasibility of implementing the technologies re viewed under the theme of waste to resource conversion and recycling Zhou and Zhao Murakami With a total land area of square kilometers Singapore has the third highest population density inthe world at people per square kilometer World Bank Group Competition for land is therefore tough and o ers little oppor tunity to implement new largescale mixedwaste processing and seg regation facilities recycling centers and waste digestors As Singa pore s population is urbanized implementation of these large scale technologies in urban spaceconstrained environments could encounter public backlash due to the disruptive e ects of waste conver sion technologies such as foul odors and loud noises In the case of food waste Singapore has a high potential for improvement as only of it is recycled and the volume of food waste generated continues to grow annually as shown in Fig The new IWMF that will begin operating in is expected to treat tonnes of food waste per day alone which would only increase the recycling rate to at most which still leaves more room for im provement However large scale food waste recycling facilities de signed to treat as high as tonnes of food waste per day have provento be unsuccessful in Singapore due to contamination and poor logistics in food waste collection EcoBusiness Food waste is typically generated in many distributed locations Therefore implementation of additional food waste digesters to successfully increase the amount of Fig Singlestream recycling collection bin in Singapore Fig Food waste generation in Singapore between P Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling food waste recycled will require conventional large scale technologies to be scaled down to match the volumes generated at the di erent sites and also be located closer to the source to avoid logistical issues Lou et al Systems will need to be designed in a way that have a very low level of disturbance to people in residential and commercial areas Paper recycling currently stands at and o ers more potential for increasing waste recovery In Singapore waste paper that is recyclable is sorted baled and shipped overseas for recycling since there are no paper mills in Singapore Restrictions in land use does not make it feasible for implementing new paper recycling facilities in Singapore However the amount of waste paper disposed can be reduced by in creasing the amount of waste paper collected sorted and baled Existing technologies for collecting and sorting paper include conveyor belts balers trucks which are all very large in size The space occupied by such equipment and storage space are limitations to increasing the rate of waste paper recovery in highly dense urban regions such as Singapore Plastic recycling currently stands at which presents a high op portunity for improvement Currently a majority of the plastic that Singapore recycles is done outside of the country In Singapore exported nearly tonnes of plastic waste to China Malaysia Vietnam and Indonesia United Nations representing about of the plastic waste Singapore recycled and of the total plastic wastegenerated Singapore has therefore relied on its larger neighboring countries with large scale facilities to deal the process of shredding and washing waste plastics for recycling or through chemical recycling The processes of collection and sorting of waste plastics however is taken care of by public waste collectors and other companies in Singapore Even if Singapore were able to implement large scale plastic facilities to create products from recycled plastic waste other than electricity and fuel the issue of plastic waste contamination would still need to be resolved More than of waste plastics collected by recycling fa cilities in Singapore are incinerated because they are highly contaminated Today Therefore the issue of preventing con tamination of waste plastics should be addressed if mechanicalrecycling methods are to be used to boost the plastic recycling rate in Singapore far beyond Tertiary plastic recycling to high value fuels through thermochemical conversion methods could also serve as al ternative to mechanical plastic recycling to deal with the high mixture and impurities in Singapore s plastic waste streams Khoo For ewaste streams using pyrometallurgical methods to recycle the tonnes of ewaste produced in Singapore annually will face implementation barriers due to high costs high energy intensity and toxic fumes that pollute the environment Voluntary programs led by industry currently exist where companies accept di erent types of e wastes and send them o to partner companies for recycling NEA a A total of companies in Singapore are listed as o cial partners for ewaste recycling NEA a of which two of these companies publicly state that they use hydrometallurgical methods to recover valuable materials in ewaste These companies carry out their operations in facilities sited on industrial premises Hydrometallurgical methods have attracted more attention in research and development in Singapore Nanyang Technological University the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission and NEA have invested USD million to develop a research center focused on less toxic e waste recycling using hydrometallurgical methods along with other nonpyrometallurgical techniques Channel NewsAsia a b Re manufacturing would also be a feasible method Singapore can use toreduce the amount of electronics and electrical equipment that have to be recycled Research and development and implementation of re manufacturing in industry is already active in Singapore at research institutes such as the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre ARTC that collaborates with members ranging from global multinational corporations to small and medium enterprises ARTC Future research areas in ZWM To overcome the limitations that current ZWM technologies may face during implementation in Singapore and other dense urban settings around the world several areas of research are recommended Smart bins that measure waste material composition To ad vance smart waste audit and reduction planning smart waste binsneed to be able to collect data about the material composition of the waste disposed in the bin This type of data is valuable for organizations to monitor the type of waste they produce and then make strategic waste reduction plans that target speci c waste streams Identifying the waste composition in a smart waste bin would beespecially useful for countries and cities that typically use single bins for disposing both wastes and recyclable items Small and medium sized waste sorting technologies Although the global mixed waste processing industry is moving towards large regional singlestream facilities small and medium sized sorting facilities are still needed in urban centers that have higher waste generation levels Research is needed to design waste sorting and material recovery facilities and equipment that have lower space requirements so that they can be sited within or closer to urban centers Having smaller waste sorting facilities distributed in urban centers could reduce the logistical demands as the facilities would be closer to the sources of waste generation Matching consumers with remanufacturing servicesHouseholds that use products produced domestically or imported from abroad may not know that their product can be repaired or refurbished to extend its useful life and may not know where to access such services Certain companyspeci c products imported from abroad that can be remanufactured may not have their company s service available in the country the product is used in However there may be smallmedium enterprises that have the technical capability to remanufacture di erent products regardless of the company the product is manufactured from Industrial symbiosis platforms should not only focus on waste to resource ex changes but also help match consumers with remanufacturing ser vice providers These types of matches would help facilitate remanufacturing of products that are designed to be repaired or disassembled regardless of whether the product was imported or produced domestically Life cycle impact evaluation models for IS platforms Multilevel models that evaluate the life cycle impacts of all waste to resource exchanges in closing the resource loop are needed in industrial symbiosis platforms to prevent environmental burden shifting These models can help businesses and other stakeholders of a col laborative platform understand and design better systems to gain both environmental and economic costs and bene ts from closing resource loops Low et al Low et al Government entities and city planners can also use these models to measure performance in meeting environmental sustainability tar gets Small scale food waste digesters Dense urban settings present space limitations for implementing large scale digesters for recycling a region s food waste Implementation experience has shown that large scale digesters in urban settings face nancial issues due to logistical challenges Research is therefore needed in developing smaller food waste digestion systems that can be sited close to the source of generation such as residential areas or commercial dining areas and sized for the speci c daily food waste volumes The technical issues that need to be overcome are reducing odor andnoise from the small scale digesters to avoid disturbance to people nearby Reducing contamination of consumer waste streamsTechnologies for recycling waste such as plastics and paper and cardboard are already mature but recycling rates are still low OneP Kerdlap et al Resources Conservation Recycling major cause of this is that many recyclable materials become highly contaminated when mixed with other waste streams The con taminated recyclable materials are sent to the land ll or incinerator because they are no longer economic to recycle Research is neededin developing technologies that are able to recycle materials that are contaminated or technologies that can reduce the contamination of disposed materials to overcome this issue which would help boost the volume of materials that are recycled Conclusion As more nations continue to implement waste import bans gov ernments and businesses that were highly reliant on exporting theirwastes abroad are now faced with the challenge of nding alternative solutions to manage their growing volumes of wastes Moving beyondtraditional endofpipe waste disposal methods and transitioning to a circular economy is critical to overcoming the global waste challenge in a holistic manner ZWM can aid in the transition by developing man ufacturing systems that minimize waste generation across entire value chains and maximizing the use of wastes as resources in other supply chains To enable ZWM stakeholders such as generators collectors and converters and recyclers will need to know what technologies they can implement to ful ll their role in the waste value chain This study proposes a framework for ZWM comprising six themes of i design forzero waste ii smart waste audit and reduction planning iii smart waste collection iv highvalue mixed waste processing v colla borative platform for industrial symbiosis vi waste to resource con version and recycling The framework aims to help stakeholders in the waste value chain identify the technologies they can implement to achieve ZWM Through a systematic review approach stateoftheart technologies and research literature under the six themes of the ZWM frameworkwere identi ed and examined The ndings of the review revealed that there are many mature technologies under each theme of ZWM thatstakeholders can implement to address their challenges The technolo gies include additive manufacturing design for disassembly modular products and buildings smart waste auditing tools smart waste bins and smart waste collection systems material recovery and mixed waste processing technologies and facilities digital platforms for enabling industrial symbiosis remanufacturing and technologies for recycling waste streams of food paper and cardboard plastics and electronics and electrical equipment The use of IoT technologies in smart waste collection systems showed that IoT technologies should be applied to ZWM overall so that waste generators collectors and converters can be integrated on a single system that shares data to facilitate greater waste to resource exchanges The feasibility and technical limitations of im plementing the ZWM technologies in highly dense urban centers were then discussed by using the case of Singapore To overcome the tech nical limitations of ZWM technologies and make them more feasible to implement in urban centers it is recommended that future research is pursued in scaling down waste sorting facilities and food waste diges ters developing smart waste bins that collect data about waste material composition and improving collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis so that they can measure the life cycle impacts of waste to resource exchanges and match consumers with product re manufacturing services The ndings of this study can be used by countries and cities to develop a roadmap for ZWM In Singapore andother similar countries and urban settings implementing the technol ogies and conducting activities that contribute to the themes of ZWM through a roadmap will help transform the manufacturing sector by decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation and bolster resource security Appendix A Supplementary data Supplementary material related to this article can be found in theonline version at doi
