Computer Science and Engineering Graphic Era Deemed to be University Dehradun India Y Kazancoglu et al Introduction As one of the fastest growing sectors electrical and elec tronic equipment production leads to increase in waste electric electronic equipment WEEE or say ewaste Babu et al Neto et al There is a direct relationship between the consumption rates of electronic goods and the amount of generated electronic waste ewaste Due to shrinking product life cycles ewaste is a dynamic category of waste as the new models of the products are introduced to the market the consumers tend to purchase the latest versions and therefore adaptive recycling methods are needed Olofsson and Mali Babar et al This rapid growth in ewaste leads to the circular economy and sustainabilityrelated concerns in terms of impacts on environment society and economy More research is needed focusing on ewaste recycling activities Bridgens et al Advantages of ewaste recycling were categorized under economic environmental and public health and safety benefits Kumar et al Four economic benefits of ewaste recycling are firstly recovery of ewaste with an estimated value of billion and based on value the recovered metals include copper gold silver palladium aluminium and iron Secondly concentration of metals in the ewaste stream is considerably higher than in the mining operations Thirdly ewaste provides the opportunity for reusing rare natural elements including gallium and indium Finally ewaste industry creates jobs and economic opportunities In addition three main environmental benefits of ewaste recycling are Firstly it reduces risks of disposal keeping hazardous waste out of landfills Secondly it decreases demand for new metal production and consequently reduces greenhouse emissions caused by metal production and finally energy saving by ewaste recycling Adding to that main public health and safety benefits of ewaste recycling are further stated as the reduction in harmful effects of ewaste on public health and safety including skin problems damage to organs and bone structure problems in nervous system etc Among advantages or benefits of ewaste recycling ewaste management is a complex activity Managing ewaste contains many hazardous materials and the process of ewaste recycling involves significant risks to the environment human safety and business StreicherPorte et al and also for circular economy Moreover recy cling of ewaste which is one of the effective strategies of circular economy directly benefits to circular economy and it is crucial to have circular economy approach to gain more value based on sustainability Reike et al Therefore a systematic approach is essential to evaluate risks of ewaste Asante et al In this sense treatment of the ewaste is the most important subject in terms of minimizing negative impacts Structured risk assessment for ewaste recycling is essential to under stand the impacts on society and environment Frazzoli et al With this view sustainability risk assessment SRA of ewaste recycling would be beneficial to deal with environmental social and economic risks in an indus trial context Different risks of ewaste recycling require crucial deci sions due to the presence of uncertainty in the process Decisionmaking plays an important role during the SRA as assessing risks further seen as the main domain of such process Chemweno et al However decisionmaking attitudes of human are usually neglected and a theoretical integration is missing From this point of view research question for this study is stated as How shall we incorporate decision making under risk and irrationality within SRA for ewaste recycling This research aims to develop a decisionmaking method in uncertain and risky conditions in ewaste recycling system To achieve this aim firstly prospect theory which is a behavioural theory that considers decisionmaking under uncertainty and risk is proposed to examine sustainability risks of ewaste recycling Secondly a prospect theorybased multicriteria decision method TODIM acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multicriteria decisionmaking ie Tomada de Deciso Interativa Multicritrio is used to evaluate listed risks In order to show the applicability of this work a computer disassembly problem is used as a case study where computer disassembly tasks are evaluated according to relevant sustainability risks Therefore the novel point in this study is to evaluate the risks to the sustainability within a system approach by integrating SRA and prospect theory to consider irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers within the risky and uncertain nature of ewaste recycling system This study is structured as follows in Sustainability risk assessment SRA in ewaste recycling section the SRA in ewaste recycling is presented In Prospect theory section the details of prospect theory are given In Integration of SRA with prospect theory based TODIM section the integration of SRA and prospect theory is explained TODIM method section gives the details of methodology and Case study section presents the case study Results section cov ers the discussion and conclusions Sustainability risk assessment SRA in ewaste recycling Sustainability is used for describing the conditions of the society environment and economy Sikdar From the risk assessment point of view sustainability risks have Risk assessment for sustainability in e waste recycling in circular economy become growing concern for organizations Thus adequate risk assessment procedure is essential to deal with such risks From managerial context the SRA should be applied aligning environmental social and economic risks under the roof of sustainability perspective Manab and Aziz Further Aziz et al defined sustainability risks as ethical concerns related to social and environmental effects of organizational transactions Dumay and Hossain suggested that SRA provides key information for companies and stakeholders to evaluate the performance of processes The climate change population growth rapid technological developments and unpredictable sustainability risks are some of the reasons that increase the importance of SRA Wijethilake and Lama Sustainability risks threaten the sustainable development of organizations causing longterm environmental economic and social impacts There fore identification and control of these sustainability risks by SRA are important for achieving sustainability goals Valinejad and Rahmani Sustainability plays an important role during the entire life cycle of system development starting from raw material selection and use manufacturing packaging transportation distribution to customer use maintenance and finally disposal and recycle phases where there is always a sustainability risk and a continuous SRA is essential Anand et al However assessing sustainability risks on all levels is also beneficial for reducing the possibility of problems and helps to achieve sustainable development objectives Bai et al As in line with this view this study focuses on one of growing global problem ewaste recycling where SRA is important to deal with the environmental social and economic impacts of ewaste and threats on the circular economy Ewaste is a hazardous concept for human health envi ronment and businesses To manage risks of ewaste a systematic process is needed to identify sustainability focused risks Aziz et al In this regard SRA is applicable due to its holistic structure combining sustainability dimensions during risk assessment The Directive of the European Parliament and of Council divides the WEEE into ten categories large household appliances small household appli ances monitoring and control instruments medical equipment systems electronic toys electrical and electronic tools lighting equipment consumer equipment and information technology and telecommunications equipment Directive After new Catalogue of WEEE Recycling was published in which the following more categories were added range hood electric water heater gas water heater printer copier fax machine monitor mobile phone and singlemachine telephone Zeng et al Ewaste includes a high variety of materials and con tains a wide range of toxic substances that can contaminate environment and threaten human health and safety Kiddee et al Ewaste is different from other industrial wastes chemically and physically where it includes both hazardous and valuable materials that need special handling and recycling methods Robinson If ewaste is recycled or disposed without proper controls negative impacts on environment and human safety are inevitable and also provide benefits for the circular economy Moreover the biggest advantages of the circular economy approach are to propose a regenerative system for ewaste recycling Julianelli et al Therefore using SRA approach during ewaste recycling is beneficial for organizations and society to have systematic benefits Disposal of ewaste includes three main phases the collection of the ewaste the pretreatment including the activities as disassembly separation of parts and shredding and finally extraction and purification of the valuable parts for recycling Cecere and Martinelli The process of the separation of parts of ewaste can be done by using the automated machines or manually Robinson Especially in developing countries dismantling and recycling activities are performed manually which leads to generation of chemicals and plastics into the environment via water air and soil Caravanos et al According to the study of Widmer et al ewaste contains more than types of substances many of which are toxic such as mer cury arsenic cadmium selenium hexavalent chromium and flame retardants Examples of hazardous chemicals in ewaste are heavy metals and metalloids including barium mercury copper etc brominated flame retardants including exabromo cyclodo decane HBCDD and polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDE plastics including bisphenol A polychlorinated biphenyls PVC and lead glass Garca et al Purchase However the potential health risks of ewaste affect each part of the human body including central nervous system digestive and urinary system reproductive and endocrine system respiratory system blood skeleton and immune system as summarized in the report of UN Environment Among studies of specific group of ewaste Lim and Schoenung draw attention to the effects of cellular phones wastes on human health and ecology and used triple bottom line TBL approach and named dimensions as consumer responsibility corporate responsibility and government responsibility Consumer responsibility includes environmentally responsible purchase behaviour and return products to recycling processes whereas corporate responsibility focuses on design for environment the take back system environmental performance declaration technology development and compliance with environ mental regulations and finally government responsibility emphasizes the establishment of systems and institutions for waste management coordination of stakeholders and environmental education Lim and Schoenung The Y Kazancoglu et al study of Garca et al paid special attention on end oflife computers in Mexico and presented both the chemical risks including toxic elements and the risks related to processes such as storing Pinto also focused on computers under ewaste and divided potential risks of computer waste as occupational and environmental risks where occupational and environmental risks are itemized for each component of the computer In their study details of hazards are also given For instance under human safety hazard physical hazards are exemplified as cuts from glass acid contact with eyes inhalation of chemical gases and contact with phosphor Environmental hazards are further divided as air emissions ground water toxicity due to lead barium emission of dioxins and heavy metals Pinto In addition a recent study by Thais et al was conducted for disassembly transport and reassembly processes and the environmental risks of disassembly were defined under four subgroups physical hazards chemical risks ergonomic risks and accident risks Crush or impact explosion environmental impact and environmental impact are presented as potential risks of disassembly in LiquiCel Membrane Contactors Disassembly and Assembly Manuel in which each risk is analysed for the disassembly processes In the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road ADR Report risks are further categorized as oxidizing flammable explosive infectious radioactive toxic corrosive and spontaneous combustion Avikal et al a b aimed to solve a dis assembly problem and used following criteria to evaluate tasks task time part demand number of followers revenue generated part hazardous state of material and fragility The quality specificationsstandards are also significant in recycling activities and there are different kinds of specification for each type of waste including ewaste household plastic packages batteries etc Resource Asso ciation Although it can be an accepted view that risks of ewaste recycling can be categorized under sustainability dimensions Yet various knowledge gaps related to SRA have been presented by Palousis et al as need for dealing with uncertainty by a risk managementbased approach the need for characterizing sustainability risk to identify and assess them and linking entire product lifecycle with SRA In addition to these decisionmaking behaviour of human is generally neglected in SRA How ever in real life decisions are not always rational and the decision makers can be risk neutral risk averse or a risk seeker Therefore in this study it is suggested that prospect theory is suitable for decisions under risk and uncertainty Further the prospect theorybased TODIM method is proposed to develop a decision tool to evaluate SRA and fulfil the gap of knowledgeProspect theory The way of people make decisions has long been a topic of research interests Utility theory and prospect theory are two main theories that try to define how and why people make decisions Utility theory is based on assessing the utility of gain by comparison of the utilities of two stages of wealth while prospect theory assumes and shows that the outcome of decisionmaking under conditions of gains and losses is not symmetrical Cochran Utility theory was found as simple and lacks a mov ing part in terms of final states of wealth The reference point is the missing variable which is the earlier state relative to evaluation of gains and losses The main difference between utility theory and prospect theory is that in Bernoullis theory to determine utility only the state of the wealth needs to be known while in prospect theory additionally the reference state need to be known Hence prospect theory is a more complicated theory The three main principles of prospect theory were explained by Kahneman as follows Evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point which is sometimes referred to as an adaptation level Better outcomes than reference points are named as gains otherwise losses A principle of diminishing sensitivity relates to sensory dimensions and the evaluation of change of wealth Loss aversion is related to asymmetry between power of pain and pleasure People generally take risks to prevent losses where loss aversion explains variety in risk seek ing and aversion When directly compared or weighted against each other losses loom larger than gains Diminishing sensitivity for both gains and losses is rep resented by a salient feature it is Sshaped The curves of the Sshaped are not symmetrical The slope of the function differs at the reference point because reaction to losses is greater in effect than reaction to gains which is referred as loss aversion In problems where both loss and gain are possible loss aversion causes highly riskaverse choices In problems where loss is inevitable and when com pared to a larger loss that has low probability diminishing sensitivity causes risk seeking There are two other effects which support the use of prospect theory in the decisionmaking process of ewaste recycling Framing and Two Selves FramingRisk assessment for sustainability in e waste recycling in circular economy Basically framing refers to process through which people make sense of their external environment Boettcher In other words the approaches and reluctance of decision makers are affected by words and it is expected that decision makers are to be biased towards the certain option in the case of KEEP and against in case of LOSE Therefore prefer ences of decision makers are frame bound not reality bound Depending on whether the consequences are bad or good different selections in the two frames appropriate for prospect theory When the output is good decision makers are inclined to choose the certain things over the gamble On the other hand when the output is bad they prefer to take risk Hence framing effect exposes that risk averse and risk seeking choices are not reality bound Two selves According to utility decision viewpoint expected utility theory concerns the directions of rationality which should rule decision utilities Therefore it is not about hedonic experiences Kahneman categorized experienced utility as the experiencing self and the remembering self In this definition experienced utility concerns perceived pain and pleasure The experiencing self aims to answer the question Does it hurt now On the other hand the remembering selfanswers the question How was it on the whole Further the retrospective assessments are insensitive to duration and emphasize the weight of two singular moments peak and the end much more than other moments Peakend rule The global retrospective rating is foreseen well by the average of the level of painloss at the worst moment of the experience and at its endDuration neglect This refers to the procedures duration which had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total painloss In this sense the integration of SRA for ewaste recycling activities with prospect theory is explained in the following section Integration of SRA with prospect theory based TODIM The risks of ewaste recycling are studied within the scope of SRA approach In ewaste recycling business factors human and environmental safety need to be considered while assessing risks Utility theory is not suitable for decisionmaking under uncertainty and risk due to its sole dependency on outputs rather than the decisionmaking process Features of prospect theory including loss aversion reference point and diminishing sensitivity are very appropriate to explain irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers While examining risks of ewaste recycling activities under sustainabil ity dimensions potential behaviours of decisions makers according to prospect theory are summarized in Table Business factors can be considered with the objective of maximization and it is a mixed gamble problem In such situations both gain and loss are possible and therefore loss aversion causes extremely risk averse choices Potential gains or losses can be related to financial conditions customers sales rates market share and reputation of the firm In business decisions organizations tend to determine a reference point In this case organizations financial power competitiveness and the reputation can be taken as a refer ence point to make decisions However the marginal effect of loss in financial loss in sales and loss in market share decreases over time which coincides with the rule of diminishing sensitivity Human and environmental safety are considered under the objective of minimization For human safety job satisfaction and commitment of employees overall productivity labour productivity compensation costs fines and reputation of the organization could be the potential business losses For environmental safety potential losses may be considered in terms of gas emission carbon emission and loss of reputation Depending on the location of the organization the atti tude of the government level of enforcement and rules and regulations may be of the determinants of reference points for both the human safety and the environmental safety On the other hand rule of diminishing sensitivity is not applicable for human and environmental safety as environment and the losses affect the future generations wellbeing therefore it is not appropriate to claim that there is a dimin ishing effect of losses Framing and two selves effects fit well with prospect theory Further the gambles are framed in terms of gains or losses All three dimensions of our model are in line with framing and two selves effects In Table relationship Table Relationship between prospect theory aspects and sustain ability dimensions Type Loss aversion Refer ence pointDiminishing sensitiv ity Business factors Gainloss Human safety Loss Environmental safetyLoss Y Kazancoglu et al between dimensions of sustainability and framing and two selves are presented When business factors are analysed in line with the fram ing effect the reputation of the organization is emphasized and reputation may alter as a result of framing effect For two selves including experiencing and remembering occur rence time and severity influence the effects Notably the change in market share decrease in productivity financial losses and reputation problems can be given as examples of when two selves effect is applicable The framing effect means that experts provided greater importance to the human safety and the environmental safety to be used to change perceptions For instance related to human safety even though the level of occupational acci dents is low working conditions may be harmful for employ ees causing potential chronic physical or mental problems Additionally environmental factors can also be framed easily An example is focusing on improvements in emissions rate and presenting it to public while disregarding the amount of solid waste generated However for two selves effect if experts have past work experiences about human and environmental safety the remembering selves effect comes into prominence Therefore their decisions especially affected by peakend rule and duration neglect Thus the relationship was revealed between the three main principles of prospect theory and the three main dimensions of sustainability with a focus of ewaste recycling risk factors Additionally our models relationship with framing and two selves effect which are related concepts with prospect theory are presented With these explanations an applicability of the integration of prospect theory and SRA in ewaste recycling is shown Next an appropriate technique is needed for SRA of ewaste recycling In risk assessment there are many techniques for identification and evaluation the most commons are as follows brain storming Delphi technique checklist preliminary hazard analysis structured whatif technique scenario analysis and business impact analysis However in this study focus is on risk evaluation techniques and some of these are hazard and operability HAZOP toxicity assessment failure modes and effects analysis FMEA Mangla et al Panchal et al failure modes and effects and criticality analysis FMECA cause and effect analysis fault tree analysis human reliability assessment event tree analysis Mangla et al causeconsequence analysis root cause analysis layers of protection analysis and decision tree analysis Moreover multicriteria decision analysis MCDA risk indices and consequenceprobability matrix are other techniques used in risk assessment Valis and Koucky Mangla et al Bovea and PrezBelis categorized methods for evaluating environmental aspects under qualitative techniques semiqualitative techniques and quantitative techniques Qualitative techniques include checklists ten golden rules materials energy toxic emissions MET matrix and matrix element checklist Semiqualitative techniques include environmental product life cycle matrix environmen tally responsible productprocess assessment matrix ecodesign checklist method and product investigation learning and optimization tool PILOT Finally for quantitative techniques different types of life cycle assessments were given such as Markov models Monte Carlo methods qualitative uncertainty analysis statistical models component failure and initiating event models Covello and Merkhoher For environmental risk assessment FMEA is one of the most widely used techniques Zeng et al integrated environmental and quality risks of project management using the FMEA method Hu et al integrated FMEA and fuzzy AHP for the risk evaluation of green component to hazardous substance Sherwood and Shu used modified FMEA to support design for remanufacture in terms of waste stream analysis To sum up to create SRA the risk identification and risk analysis based on sustainability dimensions were conducted in ewaste recycling To account for irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers under risky and uncertain environment the prospect theory is proposed From this point of view for risk evaluation the prospect theorybased TODIM method is recommended which is explained in the follow ing part TODIM method The TODIM is a prospect theorybased discrete multicri teria method Alali and Tolga The word TODIM is a Portuguese acronym in for interactive and multicriteria decisionmaking Gomes et al Unlike most of the multicriteria methods which assume that decision mak ers seek the maximum global measure value for the cor responding solution TODIM utilizes global measurement of value calculated by the application of prospect theory Liang et al From this point of view the main reason to use TODIM in this study is it focuses on the way of people make decision under risky conditions and accepts the philosophy of prospect theoryTable Relationship between framingtwo selves and sustainability dimensions Framing Two selves Business factors Human safety Environmental safety Risk assessment for sustainability in e waste recycling in circular economy As a prospect theorybased method TODIM gives the shape the value function similar to gainslosses function of cumulative prospect theory as shown in Fig where gains and losses are always recognized concerning a reference point Pereira et al The TODIM method is useful since it utilizes verbal scale in the evaluation hierarchy of criteria relationship between alternatives and fuzzy judgements Tseng et al TODIM is a beneficial method for behavioural decision making The main benefit of the TODIM is to define the relative degree of dominance for each alternative using prospect theorybased utility function Qin et al The TODIM method can be used for both the quantita tive and the qualitative criteria since the linguistic scales of the qualitative criteria can be transformed to cardinal ones and both scales are normalized Pairwise comparison is used in TODIM to measure dominance of alternatives over each other and in the calculation part relative gainloss values of alternatives are summed for each criterion Gomes et al A decision matrix that involves alternatives and criteria should be defined as shown in Table The normalization of matrix is further conducted In Table A A Am are m alternatives C C Cn are n criteria Pij is the rating of the alternative Ai regard ing criterion Cj and n T is the weight vec tor related to the set of criteria C C C Cn which satisfies the following conditions j and n juDj Formulation of the TODIM method is summarized from the studies of Gomes et al and Qin et al as followingStep Relative weight ir

entropy can be integrated in this step for calculating weights for criteria In this study AHP is used Step Dominance degree of each alternative A i over each alternative Ak regarding to criterion Cj are calculated using Eq while is named as the attenuation factor of the losses A variety of lead to different shapes of the prospect theo retical value function in the negative quadrant The range of

developments lead to increase in purchasing rates of electronic devices including mobile phones and computers therefore reuse activities including collection and recycle is increasing vital in todays market place Kahhat et al Currently ewaste is one of the priorities in waste management practices and thus decreas ing the environmental effects of product from design phase to its end of life has become very important Nnorom and uDFFAiAknunis juDFjAiAk uDim kuDFFAiAkminm kuDFFAiAk maxm kuDFFAiAkminm kuDFFAiAkOsibanjo Potential risks of ewaste should be consid ered while designing disassembly line due to its hazardous effects for human safety and environment Therefore disassemble is one of the important stages that should be included into SRA in ewaste recycling From this point of view this study is narrowed down to a disassembly problem as a part of SRA in ewaste recycling where disassembly risks are considered for SRA This study involved a numerical example a computer dis assembly problem formulated by Ilgin and Gupta The aim of the problem is to find the optimal sequence of the computer disassembly tasks The information about the problem is given in Table As mentioned earlier there are different types of risks in ewaste recycling processes However since the computer disassembly is taken as a numerical example so it is impor tant to specify the risks based on the problem for SRA For this a focus group discussion has been conducted with six experts including three from ewaste recycling company two computer engineers and one chemical engineer As a result following risks are selected for this study to evaluate each part of the computer and used as criteria for TODIM implementation and shown in Table These given risks are used to evaluate tasks of computer disassembly processes and to prioritize tasks by considering risk factors Briefly these risks are used for the SRA and specified for the computer disassemble problem Table Risk criteria Risk criteria Explanation

sustainability in e waste recycling in circular economy Results Explained totally twelve risk factors were used as crite ria and parts of the computer were used as alternatives Microsoft Excel is used for the solution of problem via TODIM Criteria are business factors criteria are human safety risk factors and criteria are environmental risk factors These criteria are presented in Table The part of the computer which are disassembled is the alternatives for TODIM and named as ATop Cover AOptic Disk AFloppy Disk AStorage Unit ABack Plate APCI Cards ARAM Modules APower Supply AMotherboard Numerical example of this study was developed by Ilgin and Gupta Thus values of part demand were taken from their example Rest of the risk factors were evaluated by experts inputs in group decisionmaking Since higher risk causes higher priority in disassembly tasks in the scale means highest risk and means lowest risk for evaluation Evaluation of alternatives against criteria is given in Table The AHP method was hired to calculate weights and was applied separately for business human safety and environmental dimensions as a part of SRA Same six experts who participated to the risk evaluation are par ticipated to the AHP implementation and asked to evaluate criteria Weights of main criteria were found same and rest of the weights of each criterion are presented in Table A sensitivity analysis is needed to verify the stability of the results which can be done by varying values of attenuation factor of losses Gomes et al Zindani et al With this view sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the value of attenuation factor of losses aiming to determine whether or not it has an effect on the order or not Due to alterations in risk attitudes it has been thought that the result may vary for different attenuation factors In doing so and are used respectively for the sensitivity analysis and shown in Table From Table the changes in attenuation factors have no significant effects on the prioritization of the tasks which reveals the overwhelming dominance of certain alternatives over others Further RAM modules motherboard and power supply received the high priority in terms of risk assessment The floppy disc needs less attention according to the numerical results However it should be remembered that criteria selection can alter and depend on the product and it affects the numerical results Therefore implementation of the suggested methodology may give different numerical results according to the needs of the organization Discussion and managerial implications Due to decreased product life cycles and improvements in technological developments ewaste is a rapid growing waste stream and one of the significant threats on circular economy Babar et al Increasing concerns about environment reveal the importance of the endoflife phase Table Evaluation of alternatives against criteriaC C C C C C C C C C C C A A A A A A A A A Table Criteria weights

integrating the risks related to human environment and business Dumay and Hossain The SRA not only seeks to consider the organizations financial performance but also aims to maintain the longer and broader survival of the company Aziz et al Therefore risks to be evaluated under SRA can act both independently and dependently The dependent behaviour of these risks is caused by the interrelated aspects Thus the assessment of these risks should consider the interdependency As asserted by the study of Asante et al systematic approach is essential to deal with the risks of ewaste and hence this study is based on systems approach to embrace both three dimensions of sustainability and different types of risks inherent in the ewaste recycling Thus the SRA and the proposed methodology are the reflection of system approach This study integrates SRA and prospect theory to con sider irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers within the risky and uncertain nature of ewaste recycling Furthermore this study contributes the literature by integrating sustainability and risk concepts in ewaste recycling where a gap in the literature related to combinatory discussions in these subjects is stated by RafiUlShan et al From the managerial viewpoints ewaste recycling is an economically promising sector and it directly affects the circular economy However inherent potential risks should be considered by organizations to achieve sustainability by preventing environmental human and business losses Appropriate resource allocation is needed for risk prevention in a risk management process Farrel et al These resources include labour finance machinery and equipment Organizations should allocate their resources considering the different risks Considering environmental and human safety widens the number and scope of these risks Hence the proposed study can contribute to the planning and organizing activities of managers in a holistic manner The proposed riskbased task prioritization process further enables effective resource allocation In addition organizations need to consider bottlenecks in resource allocation while prior itizing tasks in ewaste recycling The proposed work can easily be applied on various different tasks in a wide range of industries dealing with ewaste and recycling Further more considering human risk attitudes during the ewaste recycling activities would be beneficial for organizations in terms of reducing potential effects on society In addition it is apparent that the managers cannot achieve a sustainable growth and continuous improvement without conducting risk management The risk assessment is an important part of risk management and it should not only be applied at the strategic level but also needed at tactical and operational levels Thus the deployment and dissemination of the risk assessment are essential for long term success sustainability and circular economy Therefore the proposed model in this study will support and equip managers aiming to integrate risk management and human decision process with an ultimate aim of achieving sustainability in ewaste recycling Conclusion Ewaste becomes a global problem which threats the sus tainability and circular economy The focus of this study is evaluating the risks of ewaste recycling and developing a decision tool under uncertain and risky conditions SRA is adopted as a tool to categorize risks of ewaste recycling and decisionmaking attitudes of human is taken into the centre of the research question of this study which is How shall we incorporate decision making under risk and irrationality within sustainability risk assessment for ewaste recycling In order to achieve the purpose of this work Table Results for the each attenuation factor ALT

A Risk assessment for sustainability in e waste recycling in circular economy the prospect theory and its aspects are integrated to the SRA for ewaste recycling and prospect theorybased TODIM method is used for a computer disassembly problem as a case study In this work the tasks of computer disassembly processes are prioritized considering risk factors The results showed that while RAM modules motherboard and power supply received the high priority in terms of risk assessment the floppy disc needs less attention From a managerial context it is revealed that integration of prospect theory with SRA is applicable for fulfilling the gap in knowledge related to considering irrationality and risk attitudes of decision makers within the risky and uncertain nature of ewaste recycling Among limitations this study can handle the ambigui ties and vagueness in the problem but the results are not generalizable Another limitation is that the proposed work has been applied in ewaste recycling Further in order to increase the effectiveness of the pro posed methodology the continuous monitoring of risks is needed and risk evaluation may be adjusted further Organi zational culture strategic priorities and vision of the company the demographic social and educational background of the experts may alter the outcomes of this work which appears as another limitation Future studies could apply the proposed methodology for other sectors and implement the suggested methodol ogy on other reallife problems Comparative analysis can be also conducted among different companies sectors and even countries Further the scope of the proposed method can also be extended by covering circular operations other than recycling
