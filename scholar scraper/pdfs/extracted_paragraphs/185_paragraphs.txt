The biofertilizer is applied within urban and  peri-urban farms to close the bioresource loop. Such BCE concept has been proposed in several EU countries with  varying degree of success in long-term operations. We systematically review the ES of BCE and identify the ES,  which are not properly compensated by the market. On this basis, we further review the potential regulatory and  supporting mechanisms, which could incentivize the successful implementation of BCE and overcome the  market/policy failures. We find that single regulatory instrument at the government and authority level could be  compromised by poor governance and practices at other levels, and therefore may not reach its full potential.  Instead, we propose a multi-level regulatory and supporting system, which combines the strengths of top-down  and bottom-up governances and motivates the self-governance of industry and citizens. We conclude by high- lighting a need for multi-level governance research supporting urban sustainable transitions, with a focus on  constructing ‘policy portfolios ’ from a systems perspective to better engage government, firms, citizens and other  stakeholders.    1.Introduction  As a new economic paradigm, circular economy  views the  economic system as a closed-loop resource management system, grad- ually replacing linear and open-ended, hence waste generating systems  . In the traditional system, the economy has developed with  insufficient internal tendency to recycle, treating the environment as a  waste reservoir. In the CE landscape, waste generation is prevented and  materials are reused or recirculated as valuable resources within  emerging product/service systems .  Food Loss  and Waste  are one of the most serious challenges  human face today. Around one third of global food produced for human  consumption is wasted, which is worth over $2.6 trillion . In  EU, about 88 million tons of food are wasted every year, equivalent to  173 kilos per person , most of which  are discarded for landfill or incineration (EC, 2020; World Biogas As- sociation, 2018 ). It is not only a waste of resources but also contributes to climate and environmental change resulting from increasing carbon  emissions, natural resource, water and land use (World Biogas Associ - ation, 2018 ). During the past decades, urban farming and food systems  have developed rapidly and attracted the attentions of academicians,  policymakers and practitioners, both in developing and developed  countries as a potential solution towards resilient and resource-saving  food production systems . Local food production  with urban farming has become an important option for stakeholders to  create urban resilience, especially in the light of climate change but also  as a measure to increase urban permeability and reduce the risk of  flooding. It has been proven that urban farming presents a potential  solution to provide food and other benefits within unexploited spaces  within the build environment (Clinton et al., 2018; Edmondson et al.,  2020 ). From the sustainability point of view, using unavoidable and  inedible FW fractions as feedstock for FW-based biorefineries, which  returns renewable energy, affordable nutrients and a range of biobased  ecosystem services, is an important environmental innovation and could  be a strong driver for sustainable social transition.  *Corresponding author at: Research Group on EcoIndustrial System Analysis, Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-  4000, Roskilde, Denmark.

Anaerobic Digestion  has been  proposed as a relatively cost-effective technology for treatment of  biomass and organic wastes of high-moisture, producing renewable  energy and nutrient-rich residues which can be applied back into  farming as biofertilizers if the micro-pollutant content is below specified  levels as defined in the new fertilizer regulation .  Compared to other existing bioenergy technologies, AD can be adapted  to a wide range of substrates, even those with high moisture contents  ranging from 54 to 87% for food waste  and im- purities  , although the  optimal operation of AD with minimum mechanical problems requires  the pretreatment of substrates . Furthermore, AD can be  implemented in both large and small scale digesters and at various  geographical locations, which makes it especially promising for treating  food waste and providing energy and fertilizers in the urban applications  of BCE models as discussed by Appels et al.  and Thiriet et al.   .  Although AD is already a relatively mature and widely applied  technology in the treatment of biomass and organic waste, e.g. wastewater, sludge, and animal manure, its application in BCE contexts   still  faces technical, economic, and social challenges (Angouria-Tsorochidou  and Thomsen, 2021 ). In the US, only less than 2% of food waste is  anaerobically digested, while most of food waste is still incinerated or  landfilled . BCE provides many  social and environmental benefits in addition to the economic outputs,  but most of them are not properly compensated by the current market  setting , which represents a barrier for BCE models to  become economically viable in practice. Traditionally, the BCE is  focused on technological systems, but it can also benefit from an overall  understanding of its connected human-ecological systems (i.e. ecosys - tems) . Knowledge of ecosystem services  obtained  from BCE could provide stakeholders with more information allowing  for this type of nature-based value creation to be included in their  decision-making frameworks. Therefore, our first aim is to systemically  review the ES from BCE model  with focus on identifying non-  market ES, by asking the question ‘what are ES from local BCE within  the urban areas? ’.

The  European Commission  has identified several potential reasons why  some economies are still locked into the linear models. At the micro  level, it could be still more profitable for companies to pursue the linear  model . This is due to  the following: 1) the negative environmental and social impacts (ex- ternalities) of LE operations are not fully penalized in the current market  setting ; 2) the impact of cumulative effects of produc - tion and consumption in LE (such as resource depletion, pollution, and  climate change) are ignored by companies and 3) short-term profits and  dividends to shareholders are often prioritized compared to long-term  targets such as sustainable development.  In the current market setting, the market failure to incorporate all  costs and benefits leads to low competitiveness of products/services in  CE compared to in LE. The market failure does neither reflect the  resource scarcity and environmental costs nor provide full monetary  compensation for all the goods and services of CE. However, LE have  been driven by such market failures for a long time, which makes a  transition to CE a threat to the long-established market players. More - over, efforts to establish a CE model through price instruments (such as  fees, taxes and subsidies) are seen as a burden to existing dominating  markets players, rather than an essential adjustment to the market  failure in LE, which could receive many resistances (Houston et al.,  2018). In addition to pricing mechanism adjustments pushing a transi - tion to CE, there are also other concerns at different regulatory/sup - porting levels. For example, during the transition to the CE there are  usually skill gaps in the current workforce, which could require public  investments in special education. In the CE models, there could be lack  of initial capital investment and high interest rates on short payback  period , which needs support from both public  and private investors. The BCE models especially requires citizens shift  their behaviors to effectively reduce and sort FW, which could be ach- ieved by environmental education, information campaigns, and chang - ing social norms . Therefore, the  second aim of this paper is to review the existing literature to identify  alternative regulatory/supporting instruments to form a multi-level  regulatory system, by asking the question ‘which policy instruments  can best support the transition of BCE in practice?’.  The paper is structured in the following way: in Section 2, we present  the methodology used in the literature review, e.g. the period covered,  the defined categories and keywords used within each category; we  review the ES of BCE within four redefined categories in Section 3; in  Section 4, we firstly identify the potential barriers of the BCE transition  in reality, and then review the regulatory and supporting instruments at  the levels of government, industry and citizens to overcome such bar- riers. After comparing the cons and pros of instruments at different  levels, we propose an integrated multi-level regulatory system, which  could be best in supporting BCE transition. In Section 5, we discuss our  findings and propose directions for the future research.  2.Methodology  We conducted the literature review in a systematic way to keep the  replicability and minimize the potential bias. We searched in the Web of  Science database with pre-defined keywords in three categories. The  first category contained keywords related to varied parts of BCE. The  chosen keywords with logical operator OR were: bio-based circular  economy, urban farming, urban agriculture, urban horticulture, urban  gardening, urban green infrastructure, peri-urban agriculture, food  waste, restaurant food waste, household food waste, waste collection,  waste transportation, waste plants, incineration, landfill, anaerobic  digestion, solid state fermentation, sustainable transition. The second  category contained keywords related to varied ES directly or indirectly  from BCE. The chosen keywords with logical operator OR were:  ecosystem service, provision service, supporting service, regulating service, social service, cultural service, food waste, local food produc - tion, bioenergy, biofertilizers, biopesticides, platform chemicals,  habitat, biodiversity, pollination, biological control, nutrient cycling,  soil formation, air quality, climate change, water regulation, knowledge  sharing, community development, aesthetic values and recreational  function. The third category contained keywords related to regulatory  instruments and supporting schemes to facilitate the transition of cir- cular economy. The chosen keywords with logical operator OR were:  barrier, governance, regulatory instrument, tax, subsidy, grant, loan,  self-regulation, agreement, shared financing, economic incentive, waste  charge, regulation, tradeable permit, social support, social norms, edu- cation, environmental knowledge, environmental awareness, citizen  engagement, behavior change. We connect the second and third cate- gories of keywords with the logical operator OR, and connect these two  categories and the first category with the logical operator AND to find  any articles that contained at least one keyword from category 1 and one  keyword from category 2 or 3.  We restricted the initial literature search to the period from 1967 to  2020. The search first produced 4381 papers. Then we had a second-step  screening to identify research papers targeting our two research  requestions: ES from BCE, potential barriers and regulatory instruments  for implementing BCE. This screening narrowed down the selection to  129 journal articles. In addition to them, we also added manually 26  publications, which are either report, thesis or book and are found be  important complements to the papers in Web of Science database. The  final number of publications analyzed was 155.  3.Review of ecosystem services  of BCE  For the convenience of analysis and assessment, it is important to  adopt a pragmatic view of ecosystem boundaries and adapt it to our  research question. As the guiding principle, a well-defined ecosystem  has strong interactions among its components and weak interactions  across its boundaries .  The BCE ecosystem is comprised by a network of organizations,  including agriculture (food suppliers and FW product (biofertilizer,  biopesticide, etc.) users), wholesalers and retailers ,  consumers , secondary bioresource treatment plants  ), government agencies,  financing companies, citizens, educational and research organizations,  and other interested parties. All actors of the network of organizations  are involved in the BCE ecosystem through both competition and  cooperation . Each organization in the ecosystem affects and is  affected by the others , and must be flexible and adaptable   for itself to sur- vive in the long term, similar to biological systems (Peltoniemi and  Vuori, 2004).  In the current LE paradigm, agriculture provides food to different  food processors and food distributors, which deliver the food to com- mercial and private consumers. Post-consumer waste is collected  through the municipal waste collection scheme, while the municipalities  normally outsource the waste collection service to a company which  collects the mixed or source-separated waste including the FW and  transports it for landfill, incineration or to centralized composting or  biogas plants. Recently, large-scale Mechanical–Biological-Treatment   plants combining mechanical processes (e.g. shredding, separa - tion and densification) and biological treatment (aerobic and anaerobic  degradation), have become a solution for processing mixed waste (Di  Lonardo et al., 2012). However, the digestates of MBT systems is not  fully suitable for agricultural use, especially the food crop use because of  the high levels of contaminations, implying MBT cannot fully solve the  problem of nutrient recovery .  In the emerging BCE paradigm, the urban farms and infrastructure   offer a food supply system with less FL due to  short transportation distance, and a number of other beneficial services  including increase permeability of the city, recreational and aesthetic R.-G.

Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 4values to the local citizens. A local specialized separate FW collection  company, which is a part of the local BCE system, implements a separate  FW collection scheme and collects the sorted FW and transports it for  valorization at decentralized AD and SSF plants. The FW is then con- verted to bioenergy, biofertilizer and other high value products such as  biopesticides, which deliver biobased products for self-supply within the  urban farms and export excess products to peri-urban and rural farms.  The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment  report defines  Ecosystem Services   as the benefits people obtain from  ecosystems and distinguishes between four categories of ecosystem  services: 1) supporting services; 2) provisioning services; 3) regulating  services; 4) cultural services . Because our BCE  ecosystem can be viewed as an analogy to natural ecosystems, we  redefine the concepts of four categories of ES at the beginning of each of  following subsections to fit into the BCE ecosystem, from the perspec - tives of three main actors (urban farms, FW generators and FW  processers).  3.1. Provision services  Provision services are the physical goods provided by BCE, such as  local fresh food, bioenergy, biofertilizers, biopesticides and platform  chemicals.  3.1.1. FW generators  The FW is mainly produced by commercial (e.g. restaurants and  cafeterias) and private  food waste producers. In the LE,  FW is usually mixed with other waste, which is a barrier for efficient  recycling and valorization of the biomolecules and nutrients contained  in the FW. In the BCE, commercial and private FW generators are  encouraged to sort their waste into separate fraction resulting in high  quality FW, which serves as feedstock at AD and SSF plants.  The FW quality can be characterized into four categories: 1) physi - ochemical characteristics, e.g. pH, Dry Matter , Volatile Solids  , Chemical Oxygen Demand  and BioMethane Potential  ; 2) elementary composition, such as C, H, O and N content ,  C/N ratio; 3) biochemical characteristics referring to e.g. carbohydrates, protein and fats proportions; 4) nutritional elements, such as N, P and K;  5) heavy metals, for example, Cd, Cu, Hg and Pb .  The FW quality is primarily affected by its composition, e.g. FW con- sisting of rice and vegetables is high in carbohydrates while FW of meat  and eggs is rich in proteins and lipids .  Fisgativa et al. did a literature review from 70 papers and found that  FW quality is very variable and 24% of such variations may be due to the  geographical origin, the type of collection source and collection seasons  . They found that FW from Asia and North  America has lower DM content than EU while FW from Asia has lower  TAN  value than EU and North America,  which could be driven by the cultural and socio-economic reasons.  Developed countries such as USA and UK could substantially increase  food waste because of their culture favoring fresh produced food, while  in developing countries FW could generated during social activities, e.g.  the “La Tomatina ” festival in Spain . Ho and Chu  studied FW from different sources and they found that FW from  household kitchen waste and Chinese restaurant has high crude protein  content and amount of minerals; while FW from pre-consumption and  wet market has favorable C/N ratios and crude fat content (Ho and Chu,  2019 ). It is also found that during monsoon and summer reasons, more  FW may be generated due to the food preferences related to the weather  .  In addition to this, numerous studies have examined the role of waste  sorting behaviors in FW quality and factors affecting human waste  sorting behaviors. Rousta argued that the waste sorting at source is  crucial  which is confirmed by a review of Angouria-  Tsorochidou and Thomsen (Angouria-Tsorochidou and Thomsen,  2021 ). The influential factors of waste sorting behaviors can be gener - ally categorized into five aspects: social demographics (Matsumoto,  2011 ), attitudes , subject norms ,  knowledge  and perception (Briguglio,  2016 ). Steg et al. proposed an integrated theoretical framework, IFEP    which comprises a limited number of key influential factors (values,  situational cues, and goals) and key processes through which effective  pro-environmental behavior change may take place .

Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 5They argued that pro-environmental behaviors   may make people feel good and enhance their status, if the right situa- tion factors are triggered. In addition to these, Rousta found that socio-  technological design of convenient collection points and new informa - tion communication channels can significantly reduce the proportions of  miss-sorted FW .  3.1.2. FW processers  The AD digesters can produce methane as renewable energy from  FW, although the methane production could vary between the different  types of FW  and even within the same  type of food waste, depending on total solid  content and organic  content , C/N ratio, pH, protein content,  etc. . In addition to energy, the digestate produced  during the digestion process contains most of the nutrients from FW and  can be applied back to urban farms as biofertilizer. The biofertilizer has  high agronomic values due to its availability of nutrients, stability of  organic matter and biosecurity, and could keep or increase even up to  40% crop yields compared to mineral fertilizer .  Biofertilizer can also improve the soil structure and microbiology due to  its rich nutrient content and its introduction of organic matter to soils.  However, there are also some uncertainties regarding to the effects of  biofertilizer application, e.g. some studies have reported 10–25% lower  crop yields with FW digestates compared to mineral fertilizers (Odlare  et al., 2008; Svensson et al., 2004 ) because FW digestates could have  lower plant-available N concentrations than the mineral fertilizers.  Instead of competing, the digestate produced from FW could be used to  supplement mineral fertilizer to form optimal nutrient ratios for meeting  the crop nutrient demand . In addition to these,  the AD digesters can also produce other valuable product, e.g. enzymes,  bioplastics, and biopesticides .  SSF is the biodegradation of solid organics into value products such  as enzymes, biosurfactants or bioplastics, which provides alternative  usage for digestates from AD process. SSF uses solid substrates with low  level of water, reduced energy requirements, high productivity and less  inhibitory effects for enzyme production, which outperforms the con- ventional submerged fermentation technologies .  Although AD is a relatively mature and widely applied technology in  the treatment of sludge, wastewater and manures, AD for FW manage - ment still faces technical, socio-economic challenges, implying AD alone  could still not be a viable option for all countries .  Technically, mono-digestion of FW often cause digester instability  because of the accumulation of VFAs  and ammonia  inhibition, especially with a high loading rate and thermophilic condi - tions . Co-digestion of FW with other biomass, e.g.  manure or sewage sludge, could be a beneficial solution due to enhanced  of nutrients and synergy effects of microorganism .  From the economic perspective, AD systems are cost intensive regarding  the feedstock transportation, digester construction and operation, while  their revenues are mainly from gate fees of FW collection and sales of  electricity and methane .  Integrating AD with other FW based biorefineries for the production of  other value-added products might be a desirable solution. One example  is using hydrothermal liquefaction  to convert FW into oil, and a  carbon-rich hydrothermal aqueous phase which can be converted into  biomethane via AD. This HTL-AD system can increase the recovery of  energy products from FW and provide an option to choose between oil  and biomethane production .  3.1.3. Urban farms  With biofertilizers and biopesticides from FW processers as inputs,  urban farms  in turn produce local fresh food, in particular vege- tables, fruits, and herbs . Because there are concerns  regarding to pollution and infectious diseases , live- stock is much less frequently raised in UF and not considered in this  paper. The role of UFs within the total urban food supply could be, however, limited. A variety of urban farm scenarios has been analyzed  for cities in US, which found UF can typically contribute between 3 and  18% of urban food consumption depending on proportions of vacant lots  and rooftop used, production methods, etc. (Grewal and Grewal, 2012;  McClintock et al., 2013 ). Although existing quantitative studies are still  scarce and show high variability, the current evidence suggests that in  industrialized countries, UFs may only make a limited contribution (ca  10% of the global food production) in improving food self-sufficiency at  the city scale .  3.2. Supporting services  Supporting services refer to those necessary for the production or the  maintenance of all other ES. They differ from provisioning, regulating,  and cultural services in that their impacts on people are either indirect or  occur over a very long term, whereas changes in the other categories  have relatively direct short-term impacts on people. In the context of  BCE, supporting services include not only nutrient cycling and soil for- mation due to the application of biofertilizer and biopesticide from AD  and SSF plants to land, but also habitat provision from UFs and green  infrastructure to increase biodiversity. Furthermore, the indirect bene- fits of BCE due to the linkages between economic sectors are included in  this category.  3.2.1. Urban farms functioning as habitats and contributing to biodiversity  Typically, urban areas are characterized by highly simplified land- scapes, intensively developed ecosystems with low levels of biodiversity.  However, UFs can bring diverse green infrastructure back into the urban  system . Vegetative structural complexity in UFs  provides extra biodiversity conservation to the urban environment  . UFs can not only support biodiversity within  the farm sites, but also nearby areas due to the ‘spillover ’ effects of  energy, resources, and organisms across habitats. Such spillover effects  are very important processes for the survival of wildlife populations in  human-dominated landscapes because they allow for wildlife resource  acquisition and recolonization processes. The contribution of UFs to  biodiversity is affected by, e.g. the farm size, spatial location of farms  and management practice. For example, pesticide application, extensive  pruning, frequent mowing and other disturbances, could limit the ca- pacity of UFs to maintain sensitive insect species (Matteson and Lan- gellotto, 2011 ).  The biodiversity produced by urban farm system can further provide  a suite of ES, which further support other ecosystems. UFs can poten - tially provide supporting ESs, such as pollination and biological control,  to the broader urban landscape. Urban green infrastructure and floral  strips can support abundance and diversity of bees and butterflies, which  could benefit the relevant crop and fruit production (Cong et al., 2014;  Winfree and Kremen, 2009 ) through pollination. Biological control (or  biocontrol) is a method of controlling pests (e.g. insects, weeds and  diseases) using other organisms. Biocontrol could enable crop produc - tion in cities without chemical pesticides, which is especially important  in urban areas where human is more vulnerable to toxins (Robbins et al.,  2001 ). The biological controllers include parasitoids, below-ground in- vertebrates and microbes, birds and spiders, which usually benefit from  increased availability of green areas and decreased impervious cover in  the surrounding landscape, similar to pollinators (Bennett and Gratton,  2012 ).  3.2.2. Integrated urban farming and FW-based biorefineries for nutrient  recycling  In both of landfill and incineration systems of LE, nutrients leave  farms as a part of the harvest and are never returned. Instead, they enter  the atmosphere, groundwater and freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Using anaerobic processes for stabilization of the organic matter, the FW  that contains high amounts of organic matter and nutrients can be  recycled in terms of bioenergy, biofertilizer and biopesticide in urban R.-G. Cong and M. Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 6farms to close nutrients cycles and make cities more sustainable (Van  Veenhuizen, 2006). The heavy metals concentrations and other con- taminants in digestate of AD plants could be a concern, especially when  the FW is not sorted properly . The major plant  nutrients Nitrogen , Phosphorus  and Potassium  are generally  regarded as being conserved in anaerobic digestion: the feedstock  characteristics can thus be used to predict nutrient content of digestate  . The efficiency of nutrient  recycling are also dependent on other factors, such as soil type, crop  type, climate, surficial geology, management methods, etc. (Di and  Cameron, 2002).  Biofertilizers can improve soil formation through improved soil  biodiversity, resulting in increased nutrient cycling via nitrogen fixa- tion, phosphate and potassium mineralization, release of plant growth  regulating substances, production of antibiotics and biodegradation of  organic matter in the soil. High quality biofertilizers are environmental  friendly and do not cause pollution at the level of inorganic fertilizers  . Bio-fertilizers have long lasting effects due to  their slow and steady nutrient release for more than one season. As a  result, long-term use of bio-fertilizer leads to the buildup of nutrients in  the soil, thereby increasing the overall soil fertility. In addition, bio-  fertilizers have been found to be helpful for control of plant diseases.  3.2.3. Indirect and induced effects of BCE in the regional economy  Direct economic outputs in terms of revenues and employment from  business in BCE are defined as direct effects, while the results of  business-to-business transactions in terms of purchase of inputs to the  BCE are indirect effects. Induced effects are the results of increased  personal income caused by both the direct and indirect effects of BCE.  The indirect effects on the economy mainly fall into three categories: 1)  impacts on the value chain: BCE business purchases inputs from  different sectors and sells products and service through different market  channels; 2) trade substitution effect: BCE provides local food produc - tion and may reduce the import of foods from other regions; 3) BCE  could potentially change citizens’ consumption patterns (e.g. adapting  to local organic food, choosing local tourism instead of travelling  abroad) which may impact other sectors . Although  all of these changes could have significant economic, environmental and  social implications, currently the quantitative analysis of such effects are  not sufficient. Best et al.  highlight the importance of under - standing the indirect effects of the transition to CE. Cong et al.   found the multiplier effects of gross production, i.e. the total increase in  gross production divided by the direct effects in transition to CE could be  about 1.7–1.8, implying the indirect effects could be equivalent to  70–80% of the direct effects. However, there is a risk of the ‘rebounding’  effect in BCE transition . For BCE, the unfolding  of rebound effect depends on whether local food production actually  reduce, or “displace,” existing food production. If so, the original  promise of BCE could be achieved; if not, e.g. higher food consumption  could be incurred due to increased income, and the environmental  benefits of BCE could be overturned.  3.3. Regulating services  Regulating services are the services that ecosystems provide by  acting as regulators, e.g. regulating the quality of air and soil or by  providing flood and disease control. In this study, we focus on the reg- ulatory benefits of BCE at the city scale. We will view city as a whole unit  and investigate the added regulating services by BCE to its functionality.  3.3.1. Air quality, local climate and water regulation services of UFs  UFs and green infrastructure have great potential to help cities  mitigate and adapt to climate change and environmental pollutions  , through its regulating services which include air  quality regulation, local climate regulation and water regulation (Pataki  et al., 2011). Air quality regulation of UFs and green infrastructures depends primarily on design of such green structures and the ability of  plants to absorb particles and pollutants, described as leaf-area-index  . Because the vegetables produced in urban farms will be  consumed by human, there could be some health risks associated to air  pollution, through atmospheric deposition of heavy metals and other  toxic compounds . UFs and green infrastructure are  expected to be effective in mitigating the heat island effect of cities and  controlling peak water flows. An integrated design of inedible green  infrastructures separating the urban farms from the gray infrastructure  may function as a pollution-preventive filter between polluting activities   and UFs.  3.3.2. Global climate regulation services of urban farms  Global climate regulation through carbon sequestration could very  limited in crops of UFs. Nevertheless, urban farms may have an impact  on global climate through the reduction of the environmental impact of  global food trade and transportation. The average transportation dis- tance of the conventional food chain is very long compared to local food  produced by UFs . Conventional food also  needs packaging and storage, and suffers considerable food losses in the  transportation process . Reducing such losses and  transport distances by producing food locally can reduce overall carbon  emissions of food production.  However, reduction of transport distances and losses might not al- ways result in a net climate change benefit over the complete life cycle of  UFs’ products . Studies in the UK and China have  shown that the direct emissions of agricultural practices are by far the  largest share of the footprint of food production (Vermeulen et al.,  2012). Therefore, reducing emissions through shortening food trans - portation distances could have its limitations. Reduced unit yields,  additional inputs  and reduced scale-  effects may even cause higher greenhouse gas emissions in BCE urban  farming system than in the conventional farming systems (Kulak et al.,  2013). Urban farming can potentially shift consumer diets towards low-  carbon foods  implying that it may also have an  indirect reduction effect on the household carbon footprint (Jones and  Kammen, 2011). UFs usually follow organic farming principles, e.g.  minimum soil disturbance, regenerative crop rotation and application of  biofertilizer and biopesticide produced from AD and SFF plants. All of  these agricultural practices are beneficial for improving soil structure,  fertility and biodiversity and reducing indirect emissions (e.g. process  emissions from mineral fertilizer and pesticide production). Moreover,  the increased permeability of UFs could reduce the impacts of flooding.  The multifunctional services of UF has been valorized to $160 billion at  global scale .  3.4. Social and cultural services  Traditionally, cultural services refer to the non-material benefits  people obtain from ecosystems. In our study, they include aesthetic  inspiration, cultural identity, recreational values, tourist and spiritual  experience related to the urban environment created by BCE (Van  Leeuwen et al., 2010). In addition, being closely connected with human  society, BCE can also provide non-material social benefits, including job  creation from BCE, improved public environmental awareness and  public health level . In this category, we review both the  social non-material and cultural benefits from BCE.  3.4.1. Social services from urban farms  UFs and green infrastructure provide public space, where people  have the opportunity to meet each other. Because of the improved  communication between social groups and generations, UFs and in  particular community gardening, may play an important role in sharing  knowledge and environmental awareness . The  contribution of urban farming to environmental education is also  important. Educational workshops on urban agricultural practices could R.-G. Cong and M. Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 7be organized for vulnerable people who lack job, e.g. women and young  people in general. Urban agriculture, therefore, could enhance gender  equality and provide opportunities for reducing poverty, especially in  developing countries . People can  use UFs to establish social networks and obtain a sense of security, which  could be beneficial for community development . The  evaluation of 29 local food programme projects in the UK showed that  capacity building of UF (increasing social cohesion, education promo - tion, changing to healthy diets, etc.) is important for sustainable  development of local communities .  3.4.2. Cultural services from urban farms  UFs and green infrastructure usually provide recreation opportu - nities and aesthetic appeal to the local residents and tourists. The  practice of growing food and gardening reconnects people with land and  nature, alleviates citizen stress, and contributes to healthier diets  . Walking and playing sports in urban  green areas is not only a good form of physical exercise but also lets  people relax. The role that urban green areas plays in maintaining  mental and physical health is increasingly being recognized, despite  difficulties of measurement .  As urban areas are characterized with numerous historic, natural and  cultural attractions, it is common that tourism spreads in conjunction  and combined with urban farming activities. Urban and peri-urban  farms and green infrastructure can also bring tourism values combined  with the provision of facilities and services for tourists (e.g. food, ac- commodation, guided tours, and horse riding), which is called as ‘urban  agro-tourism business ’ and leads to a considerable increase in neigh - boring real estate values, e.g. through hedonic prices (Van Leeuwen  et al., 2010 ).  4.Potential barriers and regulatory instruments in  implementing BCE into the real world  4.1. Potential barriers in implementing BCE in reality  Although the BCE paradigm has shown its potentials regarding the  environmental sustainability and efficient resource utilization, there are  still several barriers existing that could impede the widespread appli - cation of this paradigm: 1) cultural barriers such as residents could be  reluctant to sort food waste or purchase BCE products; 2) market bar- riers where economic feasibility of BCE highly depends on the policy  support; 3) technological barriers e.g. infrastructural challenges and  transportation  4.1.1. Cultural barriers  Cultural barriers, particularly barriers regarding biofertilizer/bio - pesticide consumers  and FW producers  , can be important factors limiting the  market penetration of BCE. Despite having potentials in improving soil  structure and increasing crop yields, biofertilizers have not yet gained  popularity among farmers for adequate acceptance .  Farmers are not fully aware of biofertilizers ’ usefulness in increasing  crop yields sustainably. They may lack of knowledge about the efficacy  and application method of biofertilizers compared to the long-standing  conventional and inorganic fertilizers, which could be an important  cultural barrier for widespread application of biofertilizers (Mayan - glambam et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, FW generators, such as res- taurants and households, could have insufficient incentives to sort food  waste. Moreover, sorting FW is considered by some citizens to be time  consuming and boring activity, which they would try to avoid without  economic incentives. The non-sorting behavior can be negatively related  to economic development but also impacted by local social culture and  people ’s values and attitudes towards environmental responsibility,  which could be a crucial factor affecting the food waste quality and  limiting the penetration of BCE . 4.1.2. Market barriers  Access to suitable sources of finance and becoming economically  viable are key factors for firms in successful transition to BCE. Specif - ically, the market barriers have three-fold meanings: 1) high investment  costs; 2) competitive LE product prices; 3) insufficient compensations  for social and environmental benefits. In most cases, the banks could be  hesitated to grant loans to private investors because of the uncertainties  within this new market. The lack of price competitiveness of BCE  products, e.g. chemical fertilizer is usually cheaper than biofertilizer for  the same level of nutrients, which would thus undermine the afford - ability of the BCE products. The low prices of LE products are also  related to the identified cultural barriers. If LE product prices were  higher, affordable BCE products could spur consumer interest and  awareness since consumers are usually price-sensitive when making  their purchasing decisions .  Currently, there are insufficient compensations for socio-  environmental benefits from BCE. The socio-environmental benefits  are usually non-market goods, which means that they are not traded   in markets. Compensation such non-market goods are  usually from transfer payments from governments (such as subsidy and  tax) and volunteer payment by consumers. Although there are many  studies investigating the willingness to pay  of consumers for such  socio-environmental benefits (Dagnew et al., 2012; Yuan and Yabe,  2014 ), such valuation methods are questioned because consumers are  usually context-sensitive, i.e. a consumer ’s WTP for a product or service  depends on context. There could be also large discrepancy between WTP  and their real actions , implying there could be  challenges for WTP implementation in BCE. The uncertainty in mea- surements, such as WTP, also creates challenges for efficient design of  tax scheme, especially when there are big difference in socio-  demographic characteristics of the total population (Kotchen et al.,  2013 ).  4.1.3. Technological barriers  One of the crucial technological barriers is the infrastructural chal- lenge. Although in EU there are clear waste separation rules (e.g. haz- ardous household waste will have to be collected separately by 2022,  bio-waste by 2023 and textiles by 2025). In some developing countries  , poor waste infrastructure and management, e.g.  limited access to classified garbage bins, make it difficult for residents to  sort FW .  Widespread implementation of biogas upgrading and refueling  infrastructure could be more expensive than for liquid fuels, which could  limit the demand of biogas from AD plants in BCE business. The lack of  underground pipelines and connections to the national grid, as well as  other technological challenges such as control variation in composition  of biofertilizer and efficient removal of heavy-metal contaminants,  create difficulties for BCE business expansion .  Because more than 70% of FW is water, there could be inadequate in- centives for waste transportation due to low profitability, which in- creases the risk of FW supply disruption (Nevzorova and Kutcherov,  2019 ).  4.2. Multi-level regulatory systems for the successful implementation of  BCE  While BCE definitely shows its role in the future sustainable devel - opment, it still relies on the joint efforts of governments, BCE business  partners and citizens to create the necessary framework of regulatory  instruments and supporting schemes to thrive (Angouria-Tsorochidou  et al., 2021 ). The regulatory systems at different levels have their own  objectives, and should be coordinated harmoniously. In the following  sections, we outline the current situations of regulatory and supporting  systems at different levels, summarize their strength and weakness and  discuss the potential improvement, concluding with a reflection of an  integrated multi-level regulatory and supporting system. R.-G. Cong and M. Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 84.2.1. Regulatory instruments of governments and authorities  For governments and authorities, there are three types of in- struments available for them to compensate externalities of BCE and  correct potential market failures: namely 1) financial instruments; 2)  regulations and 3) cap and trade . The first two instruments are  prominent in the BCE and will be described in the following sections.  The CAP is attracting more and more attentions in the application of BCE  and will be discussed in Section 4.2.4 as an alternative instrument.  4.2.1.1. Financial instruments . There are two pri- mary types of financial instruments for BCE business: 1) financing the  public service of BCE through tax, charges or subsidy; 2) financing the  BCE investments through different investment models.   a) Financing the public ES of BCE through tax and charges (the case of  waste management)  Typical financial charges and tax for waste management are waste  charge and landfill tax. The typical cost of processing urban waste is the  gate fee, which represents a unit  payment  made by the local authority to the waste processing facility for their  waste management services to citizens . The gate  fee usually covers the cost of opening, maintaining and eventually  closing the facility along with any profits and final disposal costs of any  unusable residues. The gate fee is primarily financed by local taxes,  household service charge, and industrial user charge .  It may also include any landfill tax, which is applicable in the case of a  landfill.  Currently, the waste charge is either one-component or multi-  component system. The one-component system represents the simplest  charge model. It has only one type of basic fee, which is charged either  flat, or according to specific criteria, e.g. the area of the real estate, and  independently of both the quantity and quality of the actually generated  waste. This system does not provide any incentives to reduce the amount  of generated waste or improve waste sorting activities. The multi-  component system includes a basic fee and some variable fees paid by  each user . These variable components are  related to the collection service actually provided (known as pay as you  throw, PAYT), for instance based on the bin volume, collection fre- quency, weight and collected volume .  Multi-component waste charge models conform to the polluter pay  principle to some extents . However, in most  countries the waste charges (either the one-component or multiple-  components) are not differentiated based on the quality of the waste,  e.g. if the waste is sorted or not, which gives insufficient incentives for  residents ’ sorting behaviors . There are  some studies about using the financial instruments as a reward mecha - nism to enhance residents ’ waste sorting behaviors, such as reward  mechanism  which gives out rewards to residents if their delivered  waste is satisfactory . However, such in- struments are not widely applied due to the high monitoring costs.   b) Financing the public ES of BCE through subsidy (the case of urban  farm)  The most relevant subsidy for farming activities in EU is common  agricultural policy , which constitutes about one third of the total  EU budget . According to the definition of first pillar of  CAP , CAP supports farmers and agriculture within EU -  including urban and peri-urban farmers. However, the size of the agri- cultural area is most likely to exclude urban farmers from being eligible  beneficiaries of the CAP. This is because one of the minimum re- quirements for receiving direct payments of CAP is that the agricultural  area which they apply with is at least one hectare. The minimum eligible  size of the holding is a barrier to urban farmers who are often confined to very small spaces.  Urban farm is also literally excluded from the second pillar (rural  development) of CAP, which is targeted towards to rural areas. It is  understandable that supporting food production in rural areas only, is  dictated by the fact that there are very few other income possibilities  outside of large town and cities, and therefore the CAP ’s contributions  have a wider social effect in those less developed regions. However,  urban agricultural production has many environmental and social  functions the same as in rural areas. From this point of view, it could be  argued that the limitations of the CAP regarding urban farms represents  a barrier for transforming EU cities with environmental, socially and  economically viable urban landscape .   c) Financing the public ES of BCE through investment models (the case  of biorefineries and urban farms)  There are primarily two types of investment models related to BCE:  1) grant/loan financing; 2) shared financing. Government and author - ities may provide investment grants and low interest loans with long  repay period to BCE business in cooperation with private and public  financial institutions  .  For example, the Danish government has set the Biogas Action Pro- gramme which provided such financing support to constructions of  biogas plants. In China, Shanghai municipality provides large subsidies  to investments of equipment and infrastructure as well as urban farming  activities . The European Investment Bank  offers  medium- and long-term loans for large-scale circular economy projects  and indirect financing through local banks and other agents for small  projects . In many cases, SMEs (Small and  Medium Enterprise) and especially very young small business face dif- ficulties in obtaining collateral required by the banks and therefore have  very limited access to the loans needed to initiate the BCE projects in the  small scale .  Another business model related to the investment of BCE is sharing  financing models, where the public bodies create partnerships with  private sectors in BCE business, the so-called Public-Private-Partnership   model. The PPP model is interesting for governments and au- thorities because it can save public budget in parallel with private in- vestments and utilize the expertise of private enterprises. PPP model  could attract private investors ’ interest as well because it could secure  long-term relationship with public bodies and relative stable remuner - ation . The sharing financing models are not new at  construction of public infrastructure, but they might be innovative to  construction of decentralized biorefineries and management of urban  farms in the BCE business . PPP is also suffering  some serious problems. For example, it requires a long negotiation time  to define the services scope, pondering the risks, and discussing the  price. Once the PPP contract is signed, there is insufficient flexibility,  even there is a need to change the public sector ’s service requirements.  The delivery is often in the private sector ’s hand without sufficient  transparency and private sector could charge a high-risk premium,  implying the service of PPP could be expensive. A pros and cons analysis  of PPP can be found in the case of waste management in Suzhou, China  .  4.2.1.2. Regulations . Compared to incentive-  based financial instruments, regulation is a type of command and con- trol  system which allows public authorities to specifically  mandate a specific behavior that is socially desirable in the law and use  enforcement mechanisms  to get people  to obey it. The regulations can be implemented at the international (e.g.  EU), national and local levels.  On the international level, the EU commission has established the  Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC and identified good practice  for waste management. Sorting waste at source is one of R.-G. Cong and M. Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 9the key levers to improve the quality of recycled materials. In Article  22: it stated “member states shall ensure that bio-waste is either  separated and recycled at source, or is collected separately ” (Maarten  et al., 2020 ). Separate collection is obligatory as of 2015 for paper,  metal, plastic and glass, by 31 December 2023 for bio-waste and by 1  January 2025 for textile and hazardous household waste.  The success of regulation requires four elements: legal enforcement,  economic incentives , customized facilities and engaging  communication. In the waste separate collection case, the legal  enforcement includes, e.g. 1) visual inspection of recycling bags: if the  waste worker sees incorrect materials, he can attach a sticker that  highlights the non-compliance; 2) weight-based check: food waste is  usually wet and heave. If the waste worker notices that the bag is light, it  probably means that other waste has been wrongly put to the recycling  bag. In both cases, the workers can leave the bag at the pick-up point.  Local authorities could issue fines and other penalties to potential  offenders.  There is not a single waste collection system that can fit for all waste  streams. Customized waste collection system may be optimal  depending on, e.g. density of inhabitants, kind of housing, climate,  collection culture. Civic Amenity Sites  offer households places  where they can drop off almost all sorted waste streams. The two other  common systems are door-to-door collection and street containers. In  addition, communication is critical to inform restaurants and house - holds about the regulation to avoid the potential oversight and has been  proved efficient in the Swedish case of wood-waste management (Krook  et al., 2008 ).  4.2.2. Self-regulation  Industry self-regulation  is the process whereby typically an  industry-level organization, such as an industry association, monitors  their own adherence to legal and safety standards and manages the  partnerships, rather than external regulator monitors and enforces those  actions  ). Industry self-regulation is an  institutional complement to existing government regulatory processes.  Self-regulation can also be a preventative strategy (H˘eritier and Eckert,  2008a ): in response to the externalities created by business, e.g. in the LE  paradigm, waste management could incur many environment exter - nalities. By shaping an action collectively, firms can take the lead and  coordinate themselves to transition to the BCE business, while avoiding  the external mandatory policy regulations.  Urban community garden is a good example of self-regulation. Many  urban community gardens are often self-managing and self-regulating.  They are typically managed by gardeners ’ associations .  The association is responsible for organizing events in the garden,  reallocating disused plots, managing communications, liaising with the  government and authorities and setting up the rules of gardening.  Outside of the formal management structure, the garden is developed  and maintained according to agreements made by the community of  gardeners. For example, decisions on how to cultivate shared and  communal areas are made through community discussion. This form of  decision-making depends upon the strong and trustable relationships  between the gardeners. Gardeners are also self-managed through  collaborating whereby tools, seeds, and knowledge are shared and  exchanged.  The self-regulation is expected to strengthen the sense of belonging  and commitment level, develop more elaborate systems of self-  regulation, building new forms of participation and responsibility.  Self-regulation is also a strategy to impact potential government regu- latory systems when new policy targets are emerging. Self-regulation  usually proactively surpasses the expected compliance level, which  might be utilized to complement stringent government regulations.  4.2.3. Social supporting system  Citizen awareness, engagement and behavior change are crucial for  the success of BCE transition. This means that people participate in new forms of consumption (e.g. purchasing more locally produced food and  enjoying more recreational activities in local green areas), recycling and  disposal  and production (utilizing  biofertilizer and biopesticide from biorefineries). Even if the BCE en- ables people to enjoy new possibilities compared to the LE system,  shifting people behaviors still requires time, effort and commitment.  This will require addressing not only the extrinsic attributes (e.g.  infrastructure and incentives), but also intrinsic attributes (e.g. values  and personal norms) of people behaviors .  There are two commonly used social instruments for the behavioral  changes in BCE: 1) education; 2) social norm shifting. Here, the edu- cation is conceptualized in a broad sense to include all educational  programs, information campaigns, or any other organized effort at  deepening peoples ’ understanding of the effects of their behaviors on the  natural resource and environment. In the early 70 s, it was believed that  environmental knowledge and awareness were the key factors making  people shift to pro-environmental behaviors; the latter was known as  KAB  theory . In  1991, Ajzen presented the theory of planned behavior where he outlined  three important drivers for pro-environmental behaviors .  The first factor is attitude. A certain attitude towards a behavior is  driven by beliefs about the outcomes of the person ’s behavior and the  evaluation of those outcomes. The second factor is the social norm; i.e. a  person ’s perception what other people think he should or should not do.  The third factor is perceived behavioral control, i.e. people ’s perceptions  of their ability to perform a given behavior.  For example, the possibility that a person will sort food waste de- pends on his attitude about sorting (e.g. ‘It is a waste of time ’ or ‘Food  sorting is good for the environment ’) and the social norm (‘Will other  people sort? ’). Finally, the person ’s ability (e.g. knowledge about sorting  garbage, available time) will also affect his  participation in  household-garbage sorting.  The attitude will be affected by two factors. First, it depends on the  beliefs about the outcomes of the sorting behaviors (e.g. ‘My sorting will  not make any difference anyways ’ or ‘If everyone sorts food waste in a  proper way, we will save our environment ’) and the evaluation of these  outcomes . Education and information  campaign can enhance the awareness of the people on BCE and envi- ronmental issues. Education can also deliver knowledge of environ - mental laws and principles of functioning of the natural system to people  and help them develop practical skills and the ability to make assess - ment of the state of the environment. Through education, people are  more aware of their own behaviors ’ impact on the environment and  could adopt a more responsible attitude towards the BCE and environ - ment. Hundreds of higher education institutions currently provide CE  education as part of their programs in the fields of sustainability, engi- neering, business studies and design . However, there is still  a need to deliver the knowledge of CE to the children in primary and  secondary schools and adults in society, through e.g. information  campaign, informal education or experience sharing.  In addition to attitudes affected by information and education, the  social norm sets up rules which are followed by members of a group, and  guides human behavior without the force of laws (Keizer and Schultz,  2018 ). Social norms can affect individuals for a couple of reasons: people  may wish to be accepted, avoid social disapproval, and obtain social  reputation. People may also assume that others ’ behaviors are most  effective when they do not have any prior knowledge themselves. A vast  body of evidence demonstrates that social norms impact people ’s pro-  environmental behaviors . Many factors have  been found to influence the extent to which social norm impacts pro-  environmental behavior. These factors could be ranged from individ - ual characteristics (e.g. intrinsic motivation, socio-demographic char- acteristics, education level), the types of the social norms (e.g.  descriptive vs. injunctive), the reference group (e.g. size, geographical/  social/temporal proximity) . The social norm is  contextual, which means it can vary across countries and be contingent R.-G. Cong and M. Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 10on cultural factors . The differ - ences in levels of environmental quality, environmental preferences, and  social norm dynamics that may be present in countries at different stages  of development call for empirical work to test the effectiveness of social  norm interventions in influencing environmental behaviors in these  contexts.  Given the overall effectiveness of social norms in encouraging BCE  and pro-environmental behaviors, we should acknowledge that social  norm interventions can indeed be an effective tool for behavior change,  which is a primary driver for BCE development. There are four different  types of policy instruments that can induce changes in social norms:  active norm management, choice architecture, financial interventions,  and regulatory measures. The active norm management includes social  norms marketing through, e.g. campaign and advertising, which aims to  correct the misperception of people’s behavior in order to influence  personal choices. The choice architecture is the design of different ways  in which behavioral choices can be presented to people. Recently, the  concept of nudge became popular. A nudge is any aspect of the choice  architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without  forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic in- centives . An example of nudge in waste  recycling is to make the recycling bin much larger than the garbage bin  to encourage people recycle more waste. The financial interventions and  regulatory measures are discussed in Section 4.2.1.  4.2.4. Reflections of integrated multi-level regulatory systems in supporting  BCE transition  In the field of environmental management, there are two types of  governance mechanisms, namely top-down and bottom-up, which de- scribes how decisions and changes are planned and implemented  . The top-down governance is the imple - mentation of a policy decision which is made by governments and au- thorities  through statute, executive order, or  law to produce the social ‘desired effects’ . Regulation and  economic instruments are examples of top-down instruments. In  contrast, the bottom-up governance is initiated by regulation target  groups  through e.g. self-regulation, education  and social-norm shifting.  The top-down governance approach is a clear-cut system from the  government to the BCE industry and citizenship, with clear goals and  hierarchy of authority. Government has the resource and capacity to  implement the top-down governance. However, the top-down gover - nance often faces with three types of criticisms: 1) policy-makers may  fail to consider broader public/private objectives, constraints and po- tential conflicts in the initial policy design process. O’Toole presented a  case where the top-down model initially believed that privately owned  treatment plants outperformed public treatment plants. However, when  other factors, e.g. labor laws and technology, were integrated into the  analysis, it was found public treatment plants outperformed private  plants ; 2) Top-down model views policy implementa - tion as a purely administrative process while ignoring the political  acceptance and not adapting to local BCE practice, which could result in  a policy failure; 3) Top-down models implicitly assume that the regu- lation framers  are key actors. However, the BCE business  partners and local citizens have the expertise and may know the real  problems better. Therefore, they should be in a better position in the  policy design process. Top-down models, however, assume them to be  regulated and controlled.  In contrast, the bottom-up governance formulates the regulation  from the target groups. Moreover, the bottom-up governance calls for  the discretion in the policy implementation with respect to local con- ditions. The logic behind is that goals, strategies and policy instruments  must be deployed with special attentions to the people that the policy  will impact. Discretion by target-groups is the underlying premise of the  bottom-up governance and may be good when it uses the expertise of  local people to increase the likelihood of policy success. In bottom-up governance, one policy may not fit into all cases and the discretion  may require a customized local policy setting, which could create a  variance in policy goals. Bottom-up governance also face with two  criticisms: 1) bottom-up governance may not reflect the general interest  in society but pursue for industry-level and community-level targets; 2)  bottom-up governance may lack of resource and authority to implement  the governance.  In the BCE transition, these two governance models could comple - ment each other to optimize the policy efficiency and reduce the po- tential policy implementation resistance. The top-down governance  could integrate local BCE transition into the overall sustainable devel - opment path and ensure the necessary regulation and supports with  resource and authority. The bottom-up governance can provide discre - tion and flexibility to local target group, utilize their expertise and in- crease their engagement and commit. Therefore, we propose a three-  level  mixed (both top down and  bottom-up) regulatory and supporting system for facilitating the BCE  transition . On the top level, the government and  authorities could set up an overall strategy and policy targets with the  necessary regulation tools and resource. On the industry level, it could  be beneficial for them to self-organize and self-regulate because they  know the real problems better and require discretion to handle the local  tricky condition. On the citizen level, shifting people behaviors in the  short-term may require external drives from the top-down governance.  In the long-term the self-regulation among citizens through social norm  shifts could be more beneficial considering the policy implementation  cost and political resistance.  As an alternative policy instrument, tradeable permits may provide a  way to reconcile the top-down and bottom-up governances. Tradable  permits are a system of cap and trade  and a market-based  approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives  for reducing the emissions of pollutant. A central authority (usually a  governmental body) allocates or sells a limited number of permits that  allow a discharge of a specific quantity of a pollutant over a set time  period. Polluters are required to hold permits in amount equal to their  emissions. Polluters who want to increase their emissions must buy  permits from others willing to sell them. Compared to regulation and  financial instruments, tradeable permits are a type of flexible environ - mental regulation that allows government to decide the total environ - mental targets and local stakeholders to decide how to best meet such  targets.  In the EU, USA and many areas of the world, one of the biggest water-  quality concerns is nitrogen runoff from fertilizer use. Putting fertilizer  onto a field with poor soil won’t increase the yields as much, because a  lot of that fertilizer will just run off before the crop can use it. There are  some governments which made plans for large reduction in dissolved  inorganic nitrogen flowing. A nitrogen market could offer a flexible way  of encouraging farmers to adopt more biofertilizer, which has long  lasting effects due to their slow nutrient release and does not run off into  the water as much as chemical fertilizers , from the  BCE business, as well as rewarding innovations in farming practice. In  this way, the biofertilizer can gain more market share and subsidized by  the market through the trade of nitrogen allowance, which will support  the penetration of biofertilizer in the long term.  5.Conclusions  Transforming the LE, which has remained the dominant model since  the beginning of industrial revolution, into CE is not an easy task. Such  transformation changes our current production and consumption pat- terns radically, which will have a significant impact on the economy,  environment and society. The first contribution of this paper is we sys- tematically review the ecosystem services of BCE within the re-defined  ecosystem framework. We redefined the concepts of four categories of  ES to fit into the BCE ecosystem processes including nutrient fluxes,  intra- and intersectoral competitions between different FW processors, R.-G. Cong and M. Thomsen                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ecosystem Services 50  101298 11and the connections between ES, human welfare and economic systems.  To our knowledge this paper is the first one to redefine the ES framework  into the BCE field. We suggested that our study can be a reference to  guide practitioners, companies and public actors to reorganize their  activities and collaborate in the ecosystem settings, informing them of  market  and non-market benefits (supporting, regu- lating, social and cultural services) we can enjoy from the transition  from LE to BCE in a broad sense, while considering risk mitigation  strategies to insure quality and safety of BCE products.  The second contribution of this paper is based on a review of the  potential barriers in implementing BCE transitions and current regula - tory instruments from different levels (government, industry and citi- zens), we propose a multi-level mixed   regulatory and supporting system and some alternative policy in- struments such as tradeable permits, which is expected to utilize the  advantages of government, BCE industry and citizens in a harmony way  to maximum the policy efficiency and avoid policy failure. Regulatory  barriers and regulatory instruments are extensively discussed in the  literature on CE transition (De Jesus and Mendonça, 2018; Ranta et al.,  2018 ). We see our paper as an integration of existing knowledge of  current and potential instruments with a focus on the roles of stake - holders at different levels.  With the proposed regulatory and supporting system, we hope that  SMEs and citizens will have more incentives to be part of the BCE as  producers and consumers of products and services (local fresh food,  sorted food waste of high-quality, recreational and functional urban  environment), aligning with the sustainable development goals set by  the governments. The proposed multi-level mixed regulatory and sup- porting system can contribute to the solutions for pricing public goods  and minimizing the policy monitor and implementation costs, through  combinations of top-down governance, self-regulations and volunteer  agreements and shift of social norms.
