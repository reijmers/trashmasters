and Conclusions 
Countries considering adopting the circular economy approach and PAYT need to 
determine whether the charge for MW services will b e based on volume-based or weight-based 
of the waste collected. Both weight-based and volum e-based methods are very different in design 
and equipment requirements. In a volume-based progr am, residents are charged for waste 
collection based on the number of bags or cans they  use, indicating size of waste containers. On 
the other hand, in a weight-based program, waste is  weighed at the curb where collection crews 
measure the amount of waste residents set out for c ollection and they are billed for collection and 
disposal accordingly. Although most countries use v olume-based systems which are significantly 
less expensive to set up, operate and manage than w eight-based systems, to administer the MW 
service as part of their transition to the circular  economy, Egypt neither adopts the circular 34.93 34.93
