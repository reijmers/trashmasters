by license  introduction challenges and opportunities for circular economy transition in cities the population in cities especially in low and middleincome countries is expected to increase un desa this growth will intensify the demand for food water and energy in urban areas increasing af uence in cities also leads to compounding amounts of waste annually urban residents generate over two billion tons of waste each year kaza et al and over six billionliters of excreta per day assuming a per capita excreta generation of lday rose et al and excluding the water used to transport excreta in sewer systems due to poor urban waste collection and treatment systems the excreta is seldom treated adequately or is not treated at all verbyla et al leading to serious consequences for both public and ecosystem health implementing a circular economy ce approach through resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems can address multiple challenges and provide incentives to improve waste management infrastructure diener et al resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems aim at recovering re sources like water energy and nutrients from organic waste streams like faecal sludge wastewater and food waste through products like biogas compost and recycled water langergraber li et al details on such systems including technological aspects and case studies are

developing strategies toward implementing circularity principles ghisellini et al prendeville et al at regional national and city levels cities are a tting context within which circular solutions for waste and resource management can be implemented as well as other solutions to environmental challenges prendeville et al this is especially true for organic waste streams connected to food and sanitation systems however unlocking the bene ts of resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems re quires innovation and making the right investments not only in infrastructure and business models but also within governance domains in particular advances are needed in policy coherence coordination and collaboration among stakeholders across various sectors and governance levels van leeuwen et al understanding the governance factors that can emerge to facilitate or impede success is essential for implementing resource recovery and hence ce the ce transcends administrative bound aries and requires thinking beyond traditional sectoral governance paths to achieve this adequate governance capacity is necessary to support coordination and collaboration and to overcome impediments against adopting resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems governance capacity for the circular economy our understanding of the ce in this paper is informed by kirchherr et al who describe it as an economic system that is based on business models which replace the endoflife concept with reducing alternatively reusing recycling and recovering materials in productiondistribution and consumption processes to accomplish sustainable development implementing circularity for organic waste streams which form the biological materials cycle ellen macarthur foundation involves recovering water nutri ents energy and other materials which are typically managed within different resource management sectors the conditions that enable success in the different domains of resource management are widely covered across the literature on environmental man agement and governance eg driessen et al newell et al ostrom rist et al however the variety of sectors stakeholders and policies that are associated with these resources across governance levels creates new challenges for the ce which need to be addressed through integrated approaches in the ce literature governance in a multisectoral context is not well explored especially from the perspective of the factors that can facilitate or impede ce implementation this gap remains even though governance capacity is considered a challenge to making a business case for resource recovery velenturf and jopson and governance arrangements are critical to shaping the direction and pace of the transition to circularity flynn and hacking so far the ce literature largely focuses on technology and business models abreu and ceglia recent attempts to explore governance approaches for the ce focus on national and interna tional supply chains and standards flynn and hacking moya et al this focus neglects the governance processes that can create enabling conditions for implementation at the local urban scale furthermore the governance factors that can facilitate or impede ce implementation in the context of low and middle income countries are yet to be explored in the literature to the best of the authors knowledge in this paper we focus on the governance capacity of cities to implement resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems that address resource scarcity and improve natural resource management through a case study of the town of nai vasha kenya we aim to identify key factors that facilitate orimpede the governance capacity to implement circular approaches to the management of organic waste streams in lowincome and middleincome urban contexts particularly in subsaharan africa in section of the paper we present the case study enaivasha kenya in section we describe the methodology used and then describe the results from the case study in section in section we discuss the results providing re ections on transferrable in sights for other urban areas where there is interest in implement ing circularity in the management of organic waste we outline our main conclusions in section case study description naivasha kenya the urban population in the east african country of kenya is expected to grow from million in to million by un desa studies have shown that between and of all excreta in major kenyan urban areas is unsafely managed and is improperly disposed into the environment eg dewhurst furlong b a less than half of the solid waste generated in the cities is collected soezer and that which is collected mostly ends up at dumpsites kaza et al the solid waste generated in kenyas urban areas is predominantly organic in na ture due to the countrys expanding agroindustrial sector nema kenya aspires to deal with its waste challenges by becoming a more sustainable and circular economy according to the draft waste management policy ministry of environment and forestry and proposed climate change mitigation actions soezer however implementation has lagged policy aspirations both at national level and in localities like naivasha naivasha is within nakuru county and is located about km northwest of nairobi kenyas capital it is led by a subcounty administrator who is appointed by the county governor and approved by the countys legislative assembly republic of kenya major areas of service eg public health water environ ment and agriculture have dedicated departments at county level and representative of ces at subcounty level naivashas economy relies on the agricultural and tourism sectors also key revenue sources for the county and the country generally the kenyan ower industry mostly concentrated around the lake naivasha area employs about million people kenya flower council the population of naivasha is expected to grow from people in to in mott macdonald the naivasha water and sanitation company the water and sanitation utility in the subcounty operates the single wastewater treatment plant in the town center with a sewer network to which about of households are connected other households use onsite sanitation and the collected faecal sludge is also discharged at the treatment plant which leads to overloading and ineffective treatment bohnert naivashas solid waste is predominantly disposed at a dumpsite where capacity is almost being exceeded there is interest from local stakeholders in mitigating these chal lenges through circularity and hence generating business oppor tunities that contribute to water energy and food security duma however implementation has so far not gone beyond a few actors operating on a small scale these factors make naivasha an interesting case for understanding how resource recovery fromorganic waste can be implemented locally and perhaps in similar cities

indicators across nine conditions and three dimensions table the knowing dimension addresses the need to be aware understand and learn about the risks and impacts of environmental challenges policy and strategic choices the wanting dimension examines the willingness of stakeholders to cooperate express and act upon their ambitions and commit to using their capabilities to nd solutions the enabling dimension considers the network resources and instruments that stake holders have available to realize their ambitions koop et al the gcf approach was selected for two key reasons first the gcf is derived from an extensive knowledge base on how norma tive principles enabling efforts and adaptive capacity can be used to overcome governance gaps and barriers that result from inef fective policy actions koop et al second since this paper aims to provide insights that may apply beyond the case study it self using the gcfs standardized triangulation approach provides the opportunity for reproducibility and comparability with other cases this can serve as a basis for systematic research in the eld of governance for the ce in urban areas of lowincome and middle income countries previous case studies that applied the framework focused on governance challenges relating to the water sector and were largely in cities outside africa eg brockhoff et al feingold et al kim et al koop et al csteovca et al in this study the gcf is applied to the ce in a context that involves multiple sectors connected to resource re covery from organic waste streams for naivasha we followed the prescribed methodological approach by koop et al but modi ed the information about the indicators to re ect the multisectoral context after developing prede ned questions for the indicators we conducted a desk study with a focus on reviewing scienti c and gray literature related to sanitation waste management and resource recovery in naivasha some literature came from online sources while local stakeholders provided other documents the desk study was guided by the pre dened questions provided in the supplementary material and itresulted in preliminary information and scores on the indicators we then conducted a stakeholder identi cation exercise through a desk study and suggestions by local partners which resulted in a comprehensive list of potential stakeholders to involve in interviews we categorized the stakeholders into various roles types and stage of the sanitation and waste service chain such as waste generation collection and transport treatment and disposal enduse to allow selection of a diverse set of interviewees cate gories of stakeholder types included national public authorities local public authorities private sector research innovation in stitutions nongovernmental organizations ngos cluster or ganizations citizens and user groups selection of interviewees focused on those primarily based in naivasha since some of thoserequested were not able to

indicators most connected to the inter viewees expertise and experience afterwards a summary of each interviewees responses was made and sent to the interviewee so that they could provide feedback and necessary corrections as well as any further substantiation related to the indicators half of the interviewees provided feedback but half had not by the time of analysis the feedback provided was

assessing the capacity to implement resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems in low and middleincome countries earth system governance  decisionmaking prevent fragmented policy and imple mentation rowley van rijswick et al and is an essential element of governance kooiman et al at the same time however there are several existing resource recovery initia tives in naivasha driven by local stakeholders this is similar to cities and towns in other low and middleincome countries where resource recovery from organic waste has been practiced for a long time otoo and drechsel with no reference to the ce discourse in fact human and animal waste have been recycled in ancient societies lthi et al long before cerelated concepts were expressed by eg boulding the apparent disconnect between useful knowledge and ongoing practice on the ground could perhaps be explained by cultural evolution theory henrich and mcelreath whereby practices are transmitted by individuals through social learning processes that involve the copying and imitation of behaviors strategies and techniques over long periods of time sophisticated solutions to everyday challenges can be generated through cultural evolution even when the society does not have theoretical expla nations for why those solutions actually work henrich therefore implementation of ce approaches especially in low andmiddleincome countries needs to take into account existing communities of practice cops and cultural norms connected to resource recovery from organic waste and seek to bridge the gaps between theoretical ce concepts and local knowledge cops arrange for local stakeholders to engage and share different perspectives and needs and ultimately to cocreate knowledge through social learning fulgenzi et al the success of ce approaches depends on the availability of a market for resource recovery products which is in uenced signif icantly by public awareness danso et al otoo and drechsel naivasha has some public awareness about resource recov ery from organic waste based on previous initiatives and this is a good foundation to build on for further implementation of circu larity on the other hand the sense of urgency in implementing initiatives for resource recovery from organic waste streams seems to be relatively low this disconnect between awareness and ur gency for action could perhaps be addressed within stakeholder engagement campaigns stephens and graham public perceptions about the reuse of wastewater and other organic waste streams are the subject of a growing body of litera ture covering issues that include cultural norms and practices the yuck factor perceived resource scarcity and pricing concerns see eg fielding et al polprasert van rensburg resource recovery from waste streams like excreta and wastewater is associated with both risks and bene ts ekane et al and implementation by stakeholders may depend on whether their risk perception outweighs their bene t judgement or vice versa a low sense of urgency by stakeholders could perhaps imply a higher risk perception in relation to dealing with organic waste streams and hence makes it crucial to have strong monitoring systems indica tor that can alleviate both perceived and real risks crosssectoral and multistakeholder collaboration relational resources are needed to operationalize ce concepts in such multisectoral contexts since collaboration is crucial abreu and ceglia moreau et al the importance of collabo ration is also highlighted across the wider governance literature eg kooiman et al phelps and tewdwrjones and in relation to broader ce approaches like industrial symbiosis and collaborative consumption models of renting sharing and bartering ghisellini et al in cities organic waste streams like food waste faecal sludge and wastewater are often handled by different stakeholders velenturf yet synergies can be created bymanaging them together through for example cotreatment and covalorization coe et al this underscores the need for crossstakeholder collaboration in naivasha the present fragmented nature of collaborations however implies that crossstakeholder learning has not yet crossed sectoral boundaries for example stakeholders from the energy and agricultural sector are often not involved in the dis cussions around sanitation and waste management yet they are crucial links in closing biomass material loops the current setup of collaborative arrangements could also create dif culties for new entrants into the resource recovery scene in naivasha espe cially if they are not from the usual sectors already involved in existing networks this highlights a role that could be played by public sector actors to foster crosssectoral collaborations also across governance levels abreu and ceglia velenturf undertaking a social network analysis could more clearly charac terize the interactions among different stakeholders and identify gaps as well as which important stakeholders are being left out of the conversation lienert et al stakeholder engagement and public participation are important elements for enhancing governance capacity kooiman and jentoft pahlwostl the results indicate that participation and engagement are not always effective this could be connected to the level of knowledge and how concepts are framed when pre sented to local stakeholders similar examples exist in the envi ronmental governance literature where stakeholder participation has not achieved intended outcomes due to challenges related to levels of knowledge among stakeholders power relations the language of interaction in the engagement process and the design of institutions and processes rydin and pennington webler et al therefore this indicates a need for mechanisms to ensure that local stakeholders have the capacity to effectively contribute to participatory processes regarding implementation of the ce the roles of the private sector public sector existing resource recovery initiatives in naivasha are mainly being led by private sector stakeholders with the public sector lagging behind while this could be explained as a result of narrow denition and scope of stakeholder mandates it is further exacer bated by the limited capacity of public sector to implement and enforce policy instruments further public sector involvement in resource recovery initiatives could further burden their over stretched capacity resource recovery initiatives are most chal lenged where the capacity of municipalities is constrained otoo and drechsel the lack of enthusiasm by public sector ac tors to be at the forefront of ce initiatives has been identi ed in other low and middleincome countries preston et al and is not unique to naivasha importantly the same can be said of local regions in europe where private sector actors have been at the vanguard of processes like establishing standards for the ce flynn and hacking and leading initiatives for circularity in cities prendeville et al velenturf private sector leadership in resource recovery initiatives is not a panacea however and should not overshadow the crucial roles of the public sector flynn and hacking kooiman and jentoft public sector actors of oading the challenge of implement ing ce approaches to the private sector could be seen as a breach of social contract velenturf and

for cross sectoral stakeholder collaboration and attract investment into their region velenturf in naivasha there are examples of the public sector playing key roles in other areas that could be applied to the ce for example thekenyan government does not manufacture chemical fertilizers but they provide subsidies for fertilizer purchase to farmers moya et al this is a strategy that not only caters for soil fertility objectives but also provides stimulus for stakeholders engaged in the supply chain of chemical fertilizers therefore one way for the public sector to be involved in resource recovery initiatives could be through providing stimuli by extending these subsidies to cover wastederived fertilizers as well the public sector could also play a role in funding resource recovery initiatives that are at the early stage until they have reached a commercially viable level that at tracts private capital national level stakeholders like the national environment trust fund are already providing seed funding for wasterelated business ventures and hence naivashabased ini tiatives can also access this funding policy strategies for the circular economy globally implementation of the ce is still in its infancy and the role of policies to steer the transition is crucial velenturf and jopson besides acting as regulatory mechanisms policies can provide a common vision describing societal level goals which is a necessity for sustainability transitions frantzeskaki et al in naivasha the relatively low level of policy and manage ment ambition condition creates a vacuum whereby local stakeholders lack incentives to drive local action development of policy and regulatory frameworks often trails behind innovation ladu and quitzow in the eu private sector actors are at the fore of establishing standards for the ce and this is seen by some as a way of providing public policy through private means flynn and hacking however implementing the ce requires the articulation of a common vision as noted in the sustainability transitions literature and this can be provided through policy frantzeskaki et al kohler et al schot and geels a vision is a key element of governance kooiman et al and the need for a common vision at a local context is highlighted by velenturf it is even more crucial considering that ce can have different meanings for different stakeholders kirchherr et al at a national and regional level policy packages established in the eu and china have been instrumental in catalyzing ce initia tives mcdowall et al even at local level cities with explicit roadmaps and strategies for circular approaches have incentivized local action and provided inspiration for other cities prendeville et al other urban areas with ambitions for ceimplementation could also establish explicit policy strategies to guide and to stimulate local initiatives a common vision for the ce can consist of multiple strategies and does not have to be created by the public sector alone as emphasized by kohler et al and frantzeskaki et al such visions can be the outcome of contestation and struggle be tween multiple visions and agendas from stakeholders across the public private and civil society sectors and across governance levels each enjoying accessibility and responsiveness indeed a diversity of strategies towards ce implementation is needed and debate about these involving various stakeholders technology users market actors households and grassroots community groups can lead to better outcomes in terms of social environ mental and economic terms beck et al as discussed in section an atmosphere of crosssectoral and multistakeholder collaboration can enable this kind of engagement and co development to occur contributions and limitations the gcf methodology was originally created for the water sector in this study it has been applied to ce implementation in a multisectoral context this shows that the framework can be transferred to other contexts with a few modi cations hence allowing also for comparisons and learning between different sectors the framework provided a structure for a comprehensive assessment and for identifying factors that facilitate or impede governance capacity to implement resource recovery from organic waste streams the breadth of the framework could have been a drawback in the study since some of the indicators seem quite similar for example indicator eentrepreneurial agents and evisionary agents as well as eroom to maneuver and e authority this implies that there was a risk that a score for one indicator could have been assigned based on justi cation that would ideally be more suited for a related indicator however the relation among the indicators provides a form of validation for example with indicators and if there is more room to ma neuver entrepreneurial agents have more opportunities and with and visionary agents are more likely to leave their mark if they have relatively high levels of authority besides the similarities of a few indicators it was challenging to describe some indicators to some of the interviewees the gcf methodology was available in english and some terms did not have accurate equivalents in naivashas local languages for some interviewees who may have had challenges conceptualizing some indicators conclusions in this study we aimed to identify key factors that facilitate or impede the governance capacity to implement ce approaches that recover resources from organic waste streams the governance capacity framework was applied to the ce in a multisectoral context in this study demonstrating the broader usefulness of the framework our results show that there is a disconnect between public awareness about ce approaches and the urgency for action especially within the public sector there is also a disconnect between theoretical ce concepts and ongoing practices by local stakeholders existing initiatives for resource recovery from organic waste streams are largely led by private sector and civil society actors and the public sector stakeholders do not seem to see a need to play a leading role moreover existing platforms for collabora tion are still arranged in silos and stakeholder participation is not always effective to improve overall governance capacity in nai vasha the public sector needs to use its convening power to foster crosssectoral collaboration and build the capacity of locald ddiba et al earth system governance xxx xxxx xxx please cite this article as ddiba d et al governing the circular economy assessing the capacity to implement resourceoriented sanitation and waste management systems in low and middleincome countries earth system governance  to effectively participate in governance processes for the ce examples could be drawn from public sector leadership in other areas to enable the codevelopment of strategies to drive ce implementation in naivasha from an international perspective concepts of ce are predom inantly focused on western societies that have full access to centralized sanitation and waste systems with typically high in vestment costs and which can rely on a relatively wellestablished public sector to monitor risks low and middleincome countries typically have localized systems relying merely on small and me dium enterprises with limited risk monitoring mechanisms a key step would therefore be to strengthen the public sector with adequate risk monitoring guidelines that facilitate safe local ce initiatives communities of practice consisting of multisector public private and civil society local stakeholders plus interna tional publicprivate partnerships and academia may provide a fruitful breeding ground to overcome the mismatch between ce theory and local practices of ce in low and middleincome coun tries it is therefore necessary to map and align with existing resource recovery initiatives norms and practices in local com munities and cocreate tailored knowledge that match with thesecontexts the insights provided in this paper could be of value to other urban areas looking to implement ce approaches both in africa and elsewhere with circumstances akin to those in naivasha credit authorship contribution statement daniel ddiba conceptualization data curation formal anal ysis funding acquisition
