The systems  analysis  performed  with the case studies  shows 
that each CE strategy  developed  at local level leverages  the spe- 
ciﬁc territorial  context.  Maribor,  in an urban setting,  focuses  on 
waste management  and human  well-being;  Central  Germany  lever- 
ages the knowledge  and innovation  potential  of the region to cre- 
ate new business  opportunities  in a circular  bioeconomy;  Scotland  
emphasizes  material  reuse for key local industries  to reduce over- 
all system  costs; Brussels  makes use of its strong local governance  
to directly  involve  citizens  in a continuous  and stakeholder-led  
planning  process;  the Basque  country  is one of the main indus- 
trial hotspots  in Spain and, as a result, its CE strategy  focuses  on 
improving  economic  competitiveness;  ﬁnally in Sicily, networks  of 
companies  are formed  to create trust and initiate  new business  op- 
portunities  by turning  waste into resources  (industrial  symbiosis)  
for the most relevant  economic  sectors  of the island. 
This ﬁnding  highlights  the importance  of including  territo-  
rial drivers  of change,  or localized  feedback  loops in the assess-  
ment of the CE strategies.  Existing  methods  and models  instead  
tend to focus on one or another  area of the CE, as indicated  in 
Section  2 ( McCarthy  et al., 2018 ). 
The main outcome  of the research  performed  is constituted  by 
the general  CLD. This has a dual purpose:  (a) it supports  the un- 
derstanding  of the existing  literature  and (b) it provides  a holis- 
tic framework  to compare  and assess the local and territorial  CE 
strategies  across different  local contexts.  Hence, our CLD might set 
a basis to critically  analyze  various  CE strategies  in an objective  
way.
