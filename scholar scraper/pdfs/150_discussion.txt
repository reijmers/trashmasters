: the role of cities and local governments in the
transformation towards a circular economy
Recent research has indicated that cities and local governments
can play an important role in the creation of closed-loop production
and consumption systems ( Bolger and Doyon, 2019 ;Petit-Boix and
Leipold, 2018 ). In political science, the traditional state-centred
research, which typically sees the national state as a single sover-
eign authority, has been contested by researchers arguing that a
broader perspective on governance is needed to fully understand
the complex functioning of the public sector and to understand the
interaction between public authorities and stakeholders in the
private sector ( Ehnert et al., 2018 ). This movement has led to a
change in perspective from “government ”to“governance ”and as
part of this process highlighted the role of cities and local govern-
ments. The exact role of local governments may differ from country
to country due to the varying relationships between central gov-
ernments and local governments resulting in different degrees of
ﬁnancial interdependence, different administrative structures, etc
(Bulkeley and Kern, 2006 ;
Ehnert et al., 2018 ). Despite these na-
tional differences, there is a clear trend that cities and local gov-
ernments are increasingly de ﬁning policies, taking action, creating
demonstration projects and collaborating in partnerships with
private companies, citizens and knowledge institutions to facilitate
and support the transition towards a circular economy ( Bernhardt
et al., 2018 ;Petit-Boix and Leipold, 2018 ). The so-called gover-
nance perspective not only pays increasing attention to the role of
local governments but also emphasises the changing understand-
ing of the role of local governments, from traditional command-
and-control regulation to non-hierarchical modes of coordination
and decision-making ( Zvolska et al., 2019 ).Table 3
