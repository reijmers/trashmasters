This research aims at  rendering a comprehensive landscape of the body of research on HCW management by  mapping the scientific  development of HCW research,  identifying the prominent HCW research themes and trends, and   providing a research agenda for HCW management towards a circular economy  transition and sustainable  environment. The analysis revealed four dominant HCW research themes:  HCW minimization, sustainable  management, and policy-making;  HCW incineration and its associated environmental impacts;  hazardous  HCW management practices; and  HCW handling and occupational safety and training. The results showed  that the healthcare industry, despite its potential to contribute to the CE transition, has been overlooked in the CE  discourse due to the single-use mindset of the healthcare industry in the wake of the infectious, toxic, and  hazardous nature of HCW streams. The findings shed light on the HCW management domain by uncovering the  current status of HCW research, highlighting the existing gaps and challenges, and providing potential avenues  for further research towards a CE transition in the healthcare industry and HCW management.

The generated healthcare  waste  can highly affect environmental sustainability (Alharbi  et al., 2021 ) and community health . Furthermore,  with an increase in population index and growth in healthcare facilities  , the global generation of HCW follows a growth  rate of 2–3%. The HCW growth rate is even faster in China, which is  expected to reach a volume of 2.496 million tons in 2023 (Li et al.,  2021 ). Therefore, HCW, as a major environmental concern, needs  proper management and adopting suitable treatment strategies before  final disposal to reduce its harmful impacts .  In this vein, safe mechanisms to accurately segregate, collect, transport,  treat and dispose of HCW are pivotal for HCW management to ensure  environmental protection and socio-economic sustainability. However,  properly implementing HCW management policies is facing many  challenges, such as lack of budget allocation by the hospital adminis - tration, unskilled workers handling the infectious waste, and outdated  technologies and methods used to dispose of HCW .  For instance, according to the assessment provided by the World Health  Organization  in 2015, only 58% of the sampled facilities from 24  countries all around the world had proper systems to deal with the safe  disposal of HCW .  A tremendous amount of research on different streams of HCW has  been carried out over the last decade. Efforts within the existing liter- ature have been mainly focused on but not limited to perceived risk and  associated factors of HCW , developing indicators for  HCW management ,  hazardous medical waste ,  HCW incineration ,  sustainable environmental management of HCW ,  HCW treatment technologies , and more recently, HCW  management challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic (de Aguiar  Hugo and Lima, 2021 ). Although delivery of high-quality care is the  main priority for the healthcare industry, waste minimization and  preparation for reuse, recycling, and recovery programs based on the  circular economy  model should be considered to save both envi- ronmental and financial resources . Nevertheless, the  literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of how a CE model can  take in place to deal with HCW due to its infectious and hazardous na- ture, which poses a serious threat to the environment and human health.  On the other hand, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has even  made the disposing of HCW in a sustainable manner more complicated,  with highly infectious waste coming from patients and healthcare  workers . Moreover, due to the fragmented  literature of HCW research, an inclusive framework of HCW research  themes and trends towards a CE transition and sustainable environment  is still blurred, calling for more investigation.  The main purpose of the current research is to provide a compre - hensive image of the body of research on HCW management taking the  CE and environmental sustainability into account. To this end, an  analytical method, combining bibliometric, text mining, and qualitative  content analyses, is employed to address three research questions   as follows.  RQ1. How has the research landscape of HCW management  developed?  RQ2. What are the prominent research themes and areas of HCW?  RQ3. What are the future research directions for HCW management  towards a CE transition and sustainable environment?  The present research is the first broad-based study that employs a  mixed-method approach to render a state-of-the-art review of HCW  streams considering the CE and environmental sustainability to the best  of the authors ’ knowledge. Thus, our review study broadly contributes to  understanding the field of HCW and its main research themes and  subject areas towards a cleaner environment,  providing insightful  guidelines and policies for practitioners and policy-makers involved  within the HCW supply chain to support environmental sustainability  and transitioning towards a CE, and  identifying research gaps and  offering future avenues for research on sustainable HCW management  towards implementing a CE within the healthcare industry.  The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows. Section  ↱2 provides an overview of the current challenges of HCW streams to- wards a CE transition and sustainable environment. The research design  and methodology are presented in section ↱3. The main findings of the  research are analyzed and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 shares the  implications for research by offering future research directions, followed  by section ↱6 that concludes the remarks and highlights the limitations  of the study.  2.Healthcare waste streams: an overview  The concept of HCW refers to any waste generated through the  process of delivering healthcare services by healthcare facilities, such as  hospitals and clinics, or in any other place by individuals or households.  A diversity of classifications exists for HCW, mainly dividing the total  stream into hazardous and non-hazardous fractions, representing  75–90% and 10–25% of the total HCW, respectively , as  illustrated in Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Non-hazardous fraction  of HCW, also known as general HCW, is usually similar to municipal  solid waste and includes paper, plastic, glass, and food residues and  containers, generated mainly from the kitchen, administrative, and  housekeeping activities within the healthcare facilities (Odur - o-Kwarteng et al., 2021 ). In contrast with non-hazardous waste that does  not result in any particular chemical or physical hazard, the hazardous  fraction of the HCW may result in a range of environmental and health  risks . The hazardous HCW is classified into  different categories according to the type, source, and risk factors  related to its handling, transport, storage, and final disposal (WHO,  2017 ). This waste stream includes sharps, infectious waste, obsolete or  expired chemical products, pharmaceuticals, anatomical and patholog - ical waste, and radioactive waste . Notably, the disposal costs  of hazardous wastes are ten times more than non-hazardous waste  . Therefore, when reporting HCW gen- eration rates, adequately identifying the types and quantities of HCW  produced is significantly crucial in proper and safe HCW management  .  The WHO and International Atomic Energy Agency have elaborated  some policy documents and guidelines to support countries in imple - menting better HCW management systems . Furthermore,  many countries have signed and ratified such international conventions  as Basel Convention on Hazardous Waste, Stockholm Convention on  Persistent Organic Pollutants, and Minamata Convention on Mercury. In  addition, most of the developed countries adopted national legislative  and administrative regulations to create a sustainable HCW manage - ment system . Fig. 1 summarizes the various levels of  HCW governance with a focus on European Union countries. Obviously,  in line with the global agreements and conventions set by the WHO and  the International Atomic Energy Agency, European Union has also laid  several legislations, directives, strategies, and action plans to improve  waste management practices in Europe, part of which refers to HCW.  These directives and action plans include but are not limited to the  Waste Framework Directive , European Green  Deal , Circular Economy Action Plan  , and Directive on single-use plastics (EU,  2019 ). Furthermore, at the regional level, the European Commission has  adopted an Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans   and the Green Agenda in the Western  Balkans  to support the green recovery of  the countries of the region. Furthermore, as a regional cooperation M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 3program, the Environmental Partnership Program for Accession was  funded by the European Union for a duration of three years   to support the development in environmental governance in the Western  Balkans and Turkey . These initiatives are followed by laws,  policies, strategies, action plans, guidelines, and steering committees at  the national level in each country and are considered and followed by  local communities, including zero-waste NGOs, business sectors, local  scientific communities, and other local stakeholders.  The status of HCW management systems in most Western Pacific  Region and South-East Asia Region countries is presented in the WHO  reports . Despite some good practices outlined in  these reports, compliance with HCW management remains a significant  challenge in many countries. For instance, some developing countries  use open burning and incinerating in single-chamber incinerators as the  major means of treating waste .  Furthermore, in low- to middle-income countries, HCW is mixed with  general domestic waste and disposed of in municipal waste facilities or  dumped illegally as the main disposal route in these countries (Bald˘e  et al., 2017; UN, 2011 ). Consequently, a proper approach for HCW  management seems to be vital to be adopted in these countries and  continued or improved in countries already considering them.  The CE has been introduced in the literature as a potential approach  to reduce the negative environmental impacts of the HCW (Kane et al.,  2018; van Straten et al., 2021 ). The CE approach refers to a regenerative  system in which, through slowing, closing, and narrowing supply chain  loops, material input, waste, and emissions are minimized (Geissdoerfer  et al., 2017 ). Accordingly, the design framework for the CE is increas - ingly used in industry to build up product circularity in terms of its  multiple-use and recycling   and product sustainability in terms of minimizing its negative impact on  the environment . Some limited CE practices  already exist within the HCW management system in various forms and  maturity levels . For instance, the CE approach has  been highlighted in the literature as a means of reducing HCW through  reusing and recycling durable medical equipment , repairing and recycling hospital instruments and surgical stainless steel  wastes , and replacing disposable products with  reusable ones in medical and dental sectors .  Besides, recovering value from disposables, such as using medical nee- dles in concrete production, has also been stressed in the existing studies  . However, there is a lack of decent academic  discussion regarding the application of CE principles and practices to  increase resource efficiency in the healthcare industry and reduce the  adverse environmental effects of both hazardous and non-hazardous  HCW.  3.Research design  The present research followed a mixed-method approach adopted  from Ranjbari et al.  by employing an analytical method to map  the scientific literature of HCW, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The rationales  behind adopting this mixed-method approach are  unfolding the  theoretical foundations and developments of HCW research by con- ducting an analysis based on a massive database and  taking advan - tage of the ability of bibliometric and text mining analyses to identify  established past evolutions and emerging topical areas (Ertz and  Leblanc-Proulx, 2018 ) within a huge amount of publications in the  literature in a reasonable manner. Data collection and the process of  analyzing the data are explained in the following sections.  3.1. Data collection and preparation  The Web of Science  database, as one of the most trusted  publisher-independent global citation databases in academia, was  selected for collecting data herein. A combination of different keywords  directly addressing the scope of our study was extracted from literature  and elaborated to design the following search string: "healthcare waste"  OR "medical waste" OR "hospital waste" OR "clinical waste" OR "infec - tious waste" OR "sharps waste" OR "pathological waste" OR "pharma - ceutical waste" OR "biomedical waste"   Fig. 1.Various levels of healthcare waste  governance with a focus on European Union countries.  M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 4AND "environment* " OR "sustainab* " OR "circular economy" OR  "circularity" OR "closed loop" OR "reduc* " OR "reus* " OR "recycl* " OR  "hazard* " OR "manag* " (search in the title, abstract, author keywords,  and keywords plus of articles). Only peer-reviewed journal articles in the  English language were considered (i.e., conference proceedings, edito - rial, reports, book chapters, etc., were excluded) with no time limit. The  search process was started in early March 2021 and stopped on June 4,  2021, with a final sample consisting of 708 articles. Table S1 in Sup- porting Information summarizes the search protocol.  Data cleaning was carried out in a reasonable manner on the final  database to prepare the input for the keywords co-occurrence and text  mining analyses . Hence, the singular and plural  forms and the full and short  forms of author keywords  were unified to avoid separately counting words with the same mean - ings. Furthermore, while different words with similar meanings, such as  "social impact" and "social effect" were unified within author keywords,  titles, and abstracts, general words without explicit meaning for the  main focus of the current study, such as "article" and "review" were  removed from the author keywords to enhance the solidity of the ob- tained results from the analyses. The unification of writing styles was  also done to merge the words and terms with a different spelling but the  same meaning, such as "optimisation" and "optimization" or "modelling"  and "modeling" within the author keywords, titles, and abstracts of the  articles.  3.2. Data analysis  As an effort to map the scientific literature of HCW, the present  research employed a mixed analytical method. The applied research  method was informed by incorporating a bibliometric analysis, a text  mining analysis, and a qualitative content analysis to effectively extract  information from a huge database of documents and draw an inclusive  snapshot of HCW evolution, characteristics, practices, challenges, major  research themes and trends, and future perspectives.  The use of large datasets and keyword-based analyses in reviewing the academic literature has been growing over recent years. Bibliometric  analysis is a systemic approach that quantitatively analyzes scientific  literature  to provide the main research trends of a  field of study and measure the research performance of journals, re- searchers, institutions, countries, and research fields within academia  . Scholars have widely used this analysis as a powerful  statistical tool to evaluate the scientific progress of various streams of  waste management research, such as food waste  and  e-waste . The bibliometric analysis herein was con- ducted using the VOSviewer software  (van Eck and  Waltman, 2010) to map the HCW literature taking environmental sus- tainability and the CE into account for the first time. Hence, a compre - hensive overview of the bibliometric status of HCW research, including  publications trends, core journals and articles, scientific co-authorship  networks, bibliographic coupling of documents, and keywords  co-occurrence analysis, are presented herein. Moreover, a text mining  analysis was conducted on the titles and abstracts of the articles based on  a term co-occurrence algorithm to unfold semantic conceptual struc- tures and latent research themes, which best characterize the relevant  literature.  Consistent with the research carried out by Jia and Jiang  and  Ranjbari et al. , a qualitative content analysis was also con- ducted herein as a complementary layer to deepen the provided insights  of the study. Accordingly, due to the high number of articles within the  dataset, a bibliographic coupling analysis was conducted to cluster the  articles with similar characteristics. Consequently, the contents of the  most recent articles over the last five years  within each  cluster of articles were scrutinized to investigate the theoretical orien - tations in HCW management.  4.Results and discussion  The obtained results are presented and discussed in the following  three sub-sections. First, the main findings of the bibliometric analysis  are presented to reveal the general status of HCW research in Section  Fig. 2.Research framework adopted for mapping healthcare waste  management research from 1985 to 2021.  M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 5↱↱4.1. Second, the identified main HCW research themes are analyzed  and discussed through text mining analysis in Section ↱4.2. And finally,  the insights provided by the content analysis are discussed in Section  ↱4.3.  4.1. Findings of the bibliometric analysis  The bibliometric parameters analyzed in this research, including  chronological distribution of publications, analysis of core journals,  influential articles, collaboration networks, funding agencies analysis,  and keywords co-occurrence analysis, are presented in the following  sub-sections.  4.1.1. Chronological distribution of publications  Searching in WoS revealed that a total of 708 articles had been  published between 1985 and June 2021 that fits our search string and  selection criteria. The first research was conducted by Mailhson   and published in American Journal of Infection Control as a critical  review of the draft manual for infectious waste management from the  Environmental Protection Agency. According to Fig. S2 in Supporting  Information , the overall growth of the published peer-reviewed journal  articles has increased since 2006, with some minor dints in the number  of publications up to now.  4.1.2. Analysis of core journals  With respect to the source journals, the 708 articles of our sample  have been published in 314 journals indexed in WoS. Among all the 314  journals, 224 journals only published one article. The top ten most  productive journals in terms of the number of publications in the HCW  research domain, accounting for 32.2% of the total published articles in  our database , are presented in the upper part of Fig. 3.  Based on the results, Waste Management & Research is the most pro- ductive journal with 81 articles, and therefore, plays a significant role in  the HCW research domain. The second and third most productive  journals are Waste Management and Fresenius Environmental Bulletin with  52, and 17 publications, respectively.  The number of articles published by each of the mentioned top ten  most productive journals during the recent five years  is  shown in Fig. S3 in Supporting Information . Waste Management & Research , the leading journal in terms of the publications number in the  whole dataset, has followed a growing trend within the recent 5-year  period and has managed to be the leading journal within this period.  Conversely, Waste Management , the second most productive journal in  our dataset, has not shown a growth rate in terms of productivity during  the past five years, despite publishing five articles in 2017 –2021. Be- sides, although Journal of Hazardous Materials and Journal of Hospital  Infection are ranked 7th and 8th productive journals, respectively, they  have had no record of publication from 2017 onwards in our database.  However, a jump could be observed in terms of the number of publi - cations by Journal of Cleaner Production in 2021, and a considerable  increase in the number of publications by Fresenius Environmental Bul- leting in 2019 and 2020.  Fig. S4 in Supporting Information shows the publication trend of the  journals with at least five articles in the period 2017 –2020 in our  dataset. Reappearing Waste Management & Research , Waste Management ,  Fresenius Environmental Bulleting , Environmental Science and Pollution  Research , Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management , and Journal  of Cleaner Production in Fig. S4 in Supporting Information shows that not  only these journals are among the top ten most productive journals in  this field of study, but also they could retain their success in being  among the most productive journals over the past five years. However,  Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association , Journal of Hazardous  Materials , Journal of Hospital Infection , and Americal Journal of Infection  Control have not appeared in Fig. S4 in Supporting Information . Sus- tainability , Journal of Environmental and Public Health , and Science of the  Total Environment are the recent journals in the list of most productive  journals in the past five years.  On the other hand, the lower part of Fig. 3 shows the top ten most  influential journals regarding the number of citations they have gained  until June 2021 based on the WoS database. With a total of 2302 citations,  Waste Management is the most-cited journal, attracting the great atten - tion of scholars in the HCW research area. The following influential  journals are Waste Management & Research , Journal of Environmental  Management , and Journal of Hazardous Materials with 994, 403, and 377  total citations, respectively.  4.1.3. Influential articles  The number of citations to scientific articles could be used to  Fig. 3.Top ten most productive journals in terms of the number of publications  and top ten most influential journals regarding the number of citations  . M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 6measure their influence on the related research area (Merig ˘o et al.,  2015 ). Table S2 in Supporting Information lists the top ten most influ- ential articles within the HCW research domain in our dataset. As shown  in Table S2, the most influential article with 135 citations is an inclusive  review paper conducted by Windfeld and Brooks  that has pro- vided an overview of medical waste management practices focusing on  the common sources, governing legislation, and handling and disposal  methods. Consistent with the previous article, Jang et al.  carried  out the second highly cited article with 130 citations to present an image  of the current medical waste management practices considering gener - ation, composition, segregation, transportation, and disposal of HCW in  Korea. A system dynamics modeling research developed by Chaerul  et al.  is ranked the third among influential articles, which has  determined the interaction among factors in the HCW system, high- lighting the importance of proper waste segregation and infectious  waste treatment prior to disposal in developing countries. Suitable  toxicity evaluation of HCW  and the issues  regarding safe management of hazardous medical waste generated by  hospitals  are also included in the most influ- ential articles. Moreover, among the top ten most influential articles,  Iranian authors with two case studies from Iranian hospitals were  ranked fourth  and tenth (Taghipour and Mosa - feri, 2009 ), focusing on the characterization of HCW. The Journal Waste  Management with six influential articles out of ten has a considerable  contribution to the HCW research.  4.1.4. Collaboration network analysis and funding agencies  A total of 90 countries contributed to the HCW research in our  dataset. Among all these countries, there were 66 countries connected to  others, constructing a collaboration network, as illustrated in Fig. S5 in  Supporting Information . The size of the circles and the thickness of the  links between each pair of circles in the networks correspond to the  number of articles of a country or institution and the strength of  collaboration between the two entities, respectively.  As shown in Fig. S5 in Supporting Information , India with 108 HCW-  related articles is placed in the topmost position of productive countries.  India is closely followed by China as the second most productive country  with 107 articles. In this vein, the USA, Iran, England, and Turkey are  the following productive countries with 59, 50, 48, and 35 HCW-related  research, respectively. Moreover, with respect to the number of collab - orations with other countries, China with 44 international collabora - tions  is ranked  first. England with 33 and India with 26 international links come next as  the second and third most collaborative countries. On the contrary,  Taiwan with one and Greece and Brazil with three links have the lowest  level of collaboration among the top ten countries in the list.  The results show that developing countries have had a considerable  role in constructing the body of knowledge in the HCW research, since  six out of the top ten productive countries are from these countries,  including India, China, Iran, Turkey, Brazil, Pakistan, and Taiwan.  Nevertheless, HCW management in developing countries has not  received sufficient attention , and many of these  countries still suffer from inappropriate medical wastes disposal and  treatment methods. This issue may be due to the lack of required  infrastructure, technological advancements, budget, regulation, and  legislative enforcement. However, the gap between high scientific  HCW-related production in academia and low adaptation of suitable  HCW strategies in practice to take a sound HCW management system in  place could be an issue of debate for more investigation within the  context of developing countries.  In terms of institutional contribution, a total of 929 institutions in  our database have conducted research in the HCW context. To illustrate  the collaboration network among institutions, the largest set of con- nected institutions consisting of 123 unique institutions were plotted, as  shown in Fig. S6 in Supporting Information . Chinese Academy of Sci- ences with 16 articles and Zhejiang University with 14 articles both from China, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences with 13 articles from  Iran are the most productive institutions in HCW research. Moreover,  the top three actively collaborating organizations in the studied data- base are Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of  Sciences, and University of Northampton with 23, 22, and 19 collabo - ration links, respectively. Iranian institutions appeared as the leading  organizations in shaping the literature of HCW-related research since  four institutions out of the top ten contributing institutions are from  Iran. Tehran University of Medical Sciences is notably highlighted as the  first institution in terms of the number of collaboration links with other  institutions and the third institution in terms of the number of  contributions.  Only 230 out of the 708 articles in our database received funding  supports. However, many of these research projects were funded by  more than one source. More specifically, 311 funding agencies were  involved in supporting these 230 research works. Fig. S7 in Supporting  Information presents the funding agencies supporting more than three  research pieces in our database. Notably, 10 out of these 11 funding  agencies are from China, which significantly highlights the important  role of China in supporting research in the field of HCW management.  National Natural Science Foundation of China, with 49 funding records,  is the leading funding agency in this field, followed by the National Basic  Research Program of China with 11 records, as the second most sup- porting program. Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Univer - sities and the National Key Research and Development Program of  China, each with 9 records of financial support, are ranked third in terms  of funding the research projects in this field of study. European Com- mission, which is the only non-Chinese funding agency on the list of  most supporting funding agencies, comes next with 8 records of funding.  Remarkably, although India has contributed more than China in terms of  the number of publications in this field of research, no Indian program  appeared on the list of top funding agencies. Besides, while the USA,  Iran, England, Turkey, Brazil, Pakistan, Greece, and Taiwan, are ranked  the top ten productive countries, there is no funding agency from these  countries within the top contributing funding agencies.  4.1.5. Keywords co-occurrence analysis  The rationale behind conducting keywords co-occurrence analysis is  that authors ’ keywords can effectively convey the main idea and border  of the scope of articles and their content .  The keywords co-occurrence analysis, as a tool to identify research  hotspots and focal nodes within the context of a particular subject (Gao  et al., 2020 ), has been widely used in recent bibliometric studies.  Co-occurrence of keywords refers to the appearance of two keywords  together in a single publication, indicating that a relationship link exists  between the two concepts .  After data cleaning and unifying keywords as explained in the  methodology section, the top 20 most frequent author keywords used in  the HCW research  are  presented in Table S3 in Supporting Information . On this basis, medical  waste, waste management, HCW, biomedical waste, and incineration  are the top five most frequent keywords with 156, 84, 62, 59, and 43  frequency of occurrence, respectively. The focus of these keywords is  mainly on managing the HCW systems and proper disposal/treatment  methods with an emphasis on the incineration of the hospital and clin- ical wastes. Hospital waste, hospital, HCW management, infectious  waste, heavy metal, medical waste management, environment, haz- ardous waste, knowledge, management, incinerator, segregation,  COVID-19, biomedical waste management, and clinical waste were the  next most frequent keywords in the HCW literature. While "total links"  denotes the number of keywords with which each keyword has a  connection link, "total links strength" shows the number of connection  links each keyword has with other keywords. Therefore, medical waste,  waste management, and HCW have both the highest total links and total  links strength scores in our database, highlighting the significant role of  these keywords within the body of knowledge in HCW research. M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 7The co-occurrence network of the keywords within the HCW  research is visualized in Fig. 4. Due to the large number of keywords,  only keywords with a minimum occurrence of two have been plotted   to increase the visibility of the network  map. As shown in Fig. 4, more occurrences of the keywords are reflected  through larger circles, and thicker links between them show a higher  number of co-occurrence of a pair of keywords. Besides, the colors of  keywords ’ circles moving from blue  to red  are  based on the average publication year in which a keyword occurs.  The top 20 most frequent pairs of keywords that most co-occurred in  HCW research are listed in Table S4 in Supporting Information . The link  between the medical waste and waste management nodes in the co-  occurrence network is the most prominent co-occurrence link with a  strength score of 25, indicating that HCW research has primarily  centered on waste management practices. Moreover, waste management  has appeared six times among the nodes contributing to the top 20 most  frequent co-occurrence links. This shows an overwhelming interest in  academia in the issue of developing effective managerial frameworks for  HCW towards a sustainable environment. The second most co-occurred  nodes are incineration and medical waste with 18 co-occurrences in the  database, highlighting the importance of safe and proper disposal of medical waste to mitigate the adverse effects of incineration on the  environment and public health. Notably, mitigating the environmental-  and health-related consequences of the incineration process is a matter  of the utmost importance for HCW management practitioners and  policy-makers. Adopting proper segregation and collection methods for  biomedical waste, particularly in dealing with hazardous waste, has also  appeared in the most salient nodes and links of the co-occurrence  network of HCW-related keywords.  4.2. Text mining analysis: identifying salient research themes  Having conducted a text mining analysis on the concatenation of the  titles and abstracts of all 708 articles, a total of 14,578 terms was  detected. According to the relatedness of the terms based on a co-  occurrence links algorithm, the extracted terms were clustered. A  threshold of at least five occurrences of terms was applied for more  visibility of the identified themes and their associated terms. As a result,  four main HCW research themes were discovered, including:  HCW  minimization, sustainable management, and policy-making,  HCW  incineration and its associated environmental impacts,  hazardous  HCW management practices, and  HCW handling, and occupational  Fig. 4.Co-occurrence network of the keywords within the healthcare waste  research.

M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 8safety and training. Fig. 5 visualizes the conceptual structure of HCW  research and its four main research themes in the literature. Moreover, a  sample of the most relevant terms included in each research theme and  also some recent exemplary references are provided in Table 1.  One of the four identified dominant HCW research themes is  "modeling approaches towards HCW minimization, sustainable man- agement, and policy-making". The studies corresponding to this research  theme have been mainly focused on the optimization issue for increasing  the performance of HCW management systems, such as routing opti- mization for urban medical waste recycling networks   and infectious waste disposal methods (Wichapa and Khokhajaikiat,  2017 ). On the other hand, multi-criteria decision-making methods have  been widely employed within the first research theme for different  purposes, such as developing assessment models for HCW disposal   and choosing proper locations for infectious waste  disposal as a critical issue in hazardous waste management to decrease  the risk imposed on the environment (Wichapa and Khokhajaikiat,  2018 ). Moreover, optimization methods have been found useful in HCW  management during the COVID-19 pandemic through  developing  cooperative models for the collection of infectious waste generated due  to the pandemic ,  sustainable  multi-trip location-routing problems for medical waste management  during COVID-19 , and  reverse logistics  network design for medical waste management after COVID-19 (Kargar  et al., 2020 ).  The second main research theme within the HCW-related academic  literature is "incineration of HCW and its associated environmental im- pacts". Incineration is the most frequently used treatment technology for  HCW due to its capability to sterilize the pathological and anatomic  waste, reduce the volume and mass, and recover energy (Zhao et al.,  2009 ). However, the incineration process produces solid residues, such as bottom and fly ash, and off-gas cleaning residues containing heavy  metals and inorganic salts . Moreover, waste  incineration due to incomplete combustion may generate by-products  with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are highly carcino - genic, teratogenic, mutagenic, and genotoxic .  Besides, the improper disposal of bottom ash remaining from the in- fectious HCW incineration has caused significant damages to the envi- ronment and public health due to its high contamination effect on the  soil and surface and underground waters . The  articles within this research theme have been mainly focused on  the  influence of incinerated biomedical waste ash, as a fine aggregate  replacement, on the properties of concrete ,   developing effective circulating systems for removing hazardous heavy  metals in medical waste incineration fly ash ,   removal of alkalinity and metal toxicity from incinerated biomedical  waste ash ,  the application of clean and safe  technologies, such as pyrolysis technology , and mi- crowave disinfection in the HCW treatment ,  and  the quantities and characteristics of pollutants emitted during  the incineration of medical waste .  Hazardous HCW, as an increasing environmental concern, has sha- ped a major research theme in HCW research due to its adverse effects  on environmental sustainability and human well-being. The main focus  of the research in the theme "hazardous HCW management practices"  has been on the adequate, proper, and safe identification, quantification,  segregation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous HCW,  which poses a significant risk to the environment and public health.  Hence, scholars have highlighted several issues in dealing with haz- ardous HCW, such as  barriers to taking a proper HCW management  in place, including limited documentation regarding generation,  handling, and disposal of waste, and failure of planning and training, in  Fig. 5.Visualization of the main identified research themes of healthcare waste  research in the literature.  M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 9particular in developing countries (Hassan et al., 2018; Mohamed et al.,  2009 ),  the lack of well-established waste segregation and handling in  many hospitals and medical center, indicating the need for activation  and enforcement of medical waste laws ,  the  role of pharmaceutical waste management in collecting and disposing  the medicinal waste of the population  and making  the public aware of the significance of proper disposal of medications  ,  evaluation of hazardous medical waste  generation from different categories of healthcare facilities (Komilis  et al., 2012, 2011 ), and  developing integrated frameworks for  medical waste management .  The last identified HCW research theme is "HCW handling and  occupational safety and training", which refers to awareness and  adequate knowledge about safe and proper handling and disposal of  infectious and hazardous HCW. The sufficient knowledge and practice of  healthcare workers to sustainably deal with HCW and its potential risks  are indispensable to perform any effective HCW management system  . The effectiveness of educational intervention  programs based on the knowledge, attitude, and practices   framework on hospital waste management  and  assessing the impact of educational training on the behavioral intention  for HCW management  have mainly constructed the  body of knowledge of this research theme. Moreover, developing a KAP  model for implementing biomedical waste management practices in  primary healthcare facilities  and for reflecting  the inadequacies in existing HCW management practices (Behnam et al.,  2020 ) has been widely considered.  The evolution of the selected main subject areas and research topics  within the identified HCW research themes over the recent years is  mapped in Fig. 6, considering their average publication year. Average  publication year calculated based on a binary counting of the terms  refers to the average publication year of all the documents that contain a  specific term in their titles or abstracts. Therefore, more than one  occurrence of a term in an article ’s title and abstract does not result in a  higher weight for the article in the average calculation. Considering the growth of the number of articles on HCW as previously illustrated in  Fig. S2 in Supporting Information , since the number of articles has  notably increased after 2006, the average publication year of the main  terms in this field usually appears after 2006. As illustrated in the  timeline in Fig. 6, research topics such as life cycle assessment, needle-  stick injury, human health risk, social responsibility, objective function,  KAP, radio frequency identification technology, and COVID-19 have  been attracting attention very recently, since their average publication  year is between 2018 and 2021. Based on the results, COVID-19 and  pandemic have been appeared as the most recent research topics with an  average publication year of 2020.647 and 2020.7, respectively. This  result is due to the recentness of COVID-19 and the surge of research to  respond to the urgent call for action against the pandemic (Ranjbari  et al., 2021c, 2021a ). Subject areas focusing on unused medicine,  biomedical waste management, sharps waste, personal protective  equipment, healthcare disposal, pharmaceutical waste, environmental  hazards, medical waste incinerator fly ash, treatment technology, in- fectious HCW, sanitary landfill, and toxicity have been located in the  average publication year period of 2013 –2017. Moreover, incineration,  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, infectious agent, landfilling, waste  management policy, body fluid, bottom ash, pyrolysis, liquid waste, and  combustion have been less attracting attention during the recent years  with an average publication year before 2013.  4.3. Content analysis  In order to deepen the analysis on the database and unfold theoret - ical orientations, a content analysis was carried out herein. To overcome  the obstacle of a large number of articles  for reasonably  conducting a sound content analysis, articles were grouped by  employing a bibliographic coupling as an article clustering technique.  Accordingly, bibliographic coupling analysis based on the number of  references commonly cited by the articles revealed five main clusters of  HCW-related articles as presented in Table 2. Therefore, the most recent  articles of each cluster within the period of 2017 –2021 were collected to Table 1  Main terms included in the identified healthcare waste  research themes in the literature.

Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 10conduct the content analysis for more investigation. As a result, having  checked the relevancy of the selected papers to the main focus of the  present research, a total of 42 recent articles were chosen as the final  sample for the content analysis.  4.3.1. Cluster 1: the application of modeling methods for effective HCW  management systems  Modeling approaches have been widely used in developing HCW  management systems to conceptualize, design, and optimize different  HCW activities and practices, such as designing collection and disposal  networks, transportation routes optimization, selecting the optimal  treatment technologies and locations. Due to the infectious nature of a  portion of HCW, effective planning is required in hospital waste trans - portation. Liu et al.  developed a location optimization model for  urban HCW storage sites based on the immune algorithm to increase the  efficiency of HCW transport from hospitals to disposal stations.  Homayouni and Pishvaee  presented a multi-objective robust  optimization model to design a collection and disposal network of  hazardous HCW to minimize the transportation and operations risks and  costs. Gao et al.  extended an integrated optimization model of  urban HCW recycling network considering differentiated waste collec - tion strategies with time windows. Establishing proper HCW disposal  centers is crucial to reduce the environmental and public risk of HCW  pollution. Yao et al.  proposed a soft-path solution to minimize  risks and mitigate the associated costs by optimizing the HCW disposal  centers ’ location-allocation problem. Torkayesh et al.  proposed a  decision-making model for HCW landfill location selection with a sus- tainable development perspective to identify the most convenient lo- cations for landfilling. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming  model was provided by Nikzamir et al.  to design a logistic  network of infectious and non-infectious wastes to minimize the network costs and the risk of exposure to contamination. Besides, a  multi-objective mixed-integer program for reverse logistics network  design for effective management of HCW in epidemic outbreaks such as  COVID-19 was proposed by Yu et al.  to identify the best locations  for temporary facilities.  Selection of the optimal treatment technology for medical waste is a  complex multi-criteria decision-making problem due to the conflicting  and intertwined quantitative and qualitative evaluative criteria (Hin- duja and Pandey, 2018 ). Hence, an integrated decision support frame - work was developed by Hinduja and Pandey  to assess HCW  treatment alternatives and prioritize and select the optimal treatment  technology among incineration, autoclaving, microwave disinfection,  chemical disinfection, reverse polymerization, and pyrolysis. In line  with the research conducted by Hinduja and Pandey  , Nar- ayanamoorthy et al.  developed a multi-objective optimization  model and showed that autoclaving is the best alternative for biomedical  waste disposal treatment methods. On the other hand, Li et al.   proposed a multi-criteria decision-making method for evaluating HCW  treatment technologies in the emerging economies and indicated that  steam sterilization is the best HCW treatment technology among mi- crowave, incineration, and landfilling.  4.3.2. Cluster 2: HCW management practices  Mismanagement of HCW owing to its potential hazard can signifi - cantly pose environmental and occupational health risks to the global  community. However, implementing effective HCW management prac- tices is not straightforward due to the complexity of its health and  environmental effects, economic aspects, and social impacts (Çetinkaya  et al., 2020 ). For instance, Ali et al.  highlighted the main chal- lenges faced by hospitals in developing countries, including  suffering  from inadequate waste segregation, collection, storage, transportation,  Fig. 6.Timeline of dominant healthcare waste -related subject areas of research.

M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 11and disposal practices,  HCW management regulations and legisla - tions lagging behind , and   the absence of decent training programs for hospital staff. In a survey in  Bangladesh, Hasan and Rahman  stated that 56% of hospital  workers do not receive any form of training to deal with hazardous  waste, and 54% of them do not use any safety equipment or clothing.  Besides, a suitable approach to select an effective HCW treatment  technology, particularly for treating hazardous waste, is still challenging  for municipal authorities . Gunawardana  , in an empirical analysis of 156 healthcare service providers in  Sri Lanka, outlined an urgent need for training the top managers  involved in the healthcare industry to create a positive attitude towards  adopting new HCW treatment technologies and trends.  Proper actions regarding HCW identification, prediction, segrega - tion, collection, transportation, and disposal in hospitals could control  putting the worker’s safety at risk. The importance of timely and pre- cisely determining the quantity and quality of infectious HCW was  highlighted by Yousefi and Avak Rostami  in effective HCW  management systems. Moreover, sustainable HCW management could  be implemented only if an adequate waste generation prediction is  made; otherwise, investment in this sector would be inefficient (Çetin - kaya et al., 2020). In this context, Santos et al. , in a study to  evaluate the HCW management in a Brazilian context, showed that more  than 55.6% of the generated HCW is general waste, followed by infec- tious, sharps, and chemicals wastes, with the shares of 39.1%, 2.9%, and  2.4%, respectively. Mmereki et al.  showed that current HCW  collection and storage facilities in Botswana in Africa do not operate  efficiently, and more focus should be on the segregation of infectious  and non-infectious from general waste, pollution prevention, and re- covery of valuable materials from healthcare facilities. In another study  conducted in 17 representative clinics in Indonesia, Wilujeng   denoted that segregation, collection, and storage of the waste generated  by clinics, comprising of 21% sharps, 42% infectious, and 37% general  waste, did not comply with the government regulatory standard. Eslami  et al.  reported that 14.8% of private hospitals and 24.29% of  government hospitals in Iran lack any treatment devices, and hazardous  HCW is disposed of without any treatment, showing poor hazardous  treatment services. Khan et al.  highlighted the need for replacing  outdated incineration plants with autoclaving, steam sterilization, and  new practices of pyrolysis to avoid the emission of toxic gases in the  Asian developing countries, which lack proper waste segregation,  collection, storage, transportation, and disposal. Developing HCW in- dicators to continuously monitor, handle, and manage HCW generation  and its associated risks significantly improves HCW risk management   and HCW operation systems from identifica - tion at the beginning to the disposal at the end.  4.3.3. Cluster 3: HCW treatment technologies and methods  Implementing effective HCW management practices to a large extent  is determined by the treatment technology applied. The application of  an HCW technology, which is simultaneously inexpensive (Liu et al.,  2019) and environmentally friendly , has been a  subject of research interest over recent years. According to the study  conducted by Jang et al. , HCW treatment technologies such as  steam sterilization, chemical disinfection, microwave sanitation, recy- cling, reverse polymerization, dry heat disinfection, autoclaving, and  incineration are considered as alternatives. Some studies highlight that  due to the advantages of the incineration method, for instance,  destruction of bacteria or viruses, reduction of the waste volume, and  the potential for energy reuse, many countries incinerate HCW (Tre- booniti, 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). Moreover, incineration is used to  dispose of 59–60% of the general HCW worldwide (Li et al., 2017; Zhang  et al., 2020). However, the medical waste incinerator is considered a key  source of hypertoxic PCDDs and PCDD/Fs emission and heavy metals  according to Stockholm Convention. Therefore, various technologies to  remove or reduce these chemicals from bottom ash and fly ash are Table 2  Selected most recent research within main clusters of healthcare waste -related articles from 2017 to 2021.

Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 12actively being developed.  To avoid secondary pollution, the academic discussion is still  ongoing with a focus on the emission characteristics of PCDD/Fs and  heavy metals resulting from the incineration (Ma et al., 2020; Zhang  et al., 2020 ), technologies for the reduction of the emission (Li et al.,  2017; Qin et al., 2018 ), and techniques to remove   or reduce the concentration of heavy metals from the medical waste fly  ash  or detoxify the fly ash (Liu  et al., 2019 ). In particular, various treatment techniques for medical  waste fly ash and their merits, demerits, applicability, and limitations  have been reviewed by Liu et al.  . An effective circulating system  based on using EDTA disodium  was developed by Li et al.   to remove Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Ni from medical waste fly ash.  Shen et al.  proposed a technology to reduce dioxin formation  during the incineration process based on using activated carbon, which  adsorbs dioxin and pelletizes it with adhesive material. The treatment  technology for medical waste incinerator fly ash, which is considered  hazardous, to simultaneously detoxify both PCDD/Fs and heavy metals  through a successive flotation process was proposed by Liu et al.  .  Exploring the possibilities of medical waste fly ash recycling in mortar  mixtures, Ababneh et al.  proposed using ethylene diaminetetra  acetic acid disodium as a chelating agent allowing the reduction of the  heavy metals concentration in medical waste fly ash. In addition, the  study by Anastasiadou et al.  demonstrated the feasibility of using  fly and bottom ash in cement matrices to dispose of them safely in  non-hazardous landfills or even to reuse these materials in the con- struction industry. Another line of studies in academia considered hos- pital wastewater and focused on the pollution of the groundwater near  the biomedical waste treatment facilities , migration  of heavy metals from the biomedical waste autoclave to groundwater  , and hospital wastewater treatment using hydrolytic bac- teria .  Even though recycling is an effective way to reduce the amount of  HCW, there is a lack of academic debate on the segregation techniques to  reduce regulated medical waste at the source of such waste generation.  For example, Shinn et al.  showed that almost 33% of all regu- lated medical waste in Korean hospitals comes from operating rooms.  According to their research, while regulated medical waste notably  consists of disposable packaging and wrapping materials for sterilization  of surgical instruments, the non-regulated medical waste includes  recyclable materials, such as plastics, cardboards, papers, and different  wrapping materials. Therefore, the reduction in HCW generation could  be achieved through the systematic segregation of hospital operating  room wastes. Furthermore, researching the hospital recycling issue,  McGain et al.  argued that due to the lack of appropriate  hospital-related recycling companies, there is a necessity to encourage  local manufacturers to reduce the amount of packaging used or to  change the materials used, which is still challenging.  4.3.4. Cluster 4: pharmaceutical waste  From the waste management perspective, two main streams of  pharmaceutical waste are  pharmaceutical wastes produced by  households and in primary care treatment facilities, including unused,  unwanted, or expired drugs or medicines with vials and syringes, and   pharmaceutical wastes, including at least one type of medical waste,  generated by pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, and other healthcare and  research facilities .  Environmental contamination in the wake of active ingredients in  pharmaceutical waste has become an emerging global concern (Chung  and Brooks, 2019 ) for the environment and eco-system, which calls for  more preventive actions and inclusive environmental stewardship of  pharmaceuticals.  Chung and Brooks  , in an in-street survey in Hong Kong with  1865 respondents, showed that 75% of the population has unneeded medicines at home. They also came to know that each household is  storing on average 138.4 g of unnecessary medicines, of which the main  type is medicines for cold. Based on their research, more than 53% of  people dispose of unwanted or expired medicines in garbage cans along  with the usual solid waste. This highlights the role of households as a  primary source of pharmaceutical pollutants to affect environmental  sustainability adversely. In another study to assesses the public  perception of environmental effects caused by pharmaceutical waste in  Malaysia, Ariffin and Zakili  denoted that while 73.8% of the  respondents believe that their household pharmaceutical waste should  be separated from other households solid waste, only 25.2% return their  unused or expired medicines through the medicine return-back pro- grams. They highlighted an urgent need to develop effective return-back  programs and channels for pharmaceutical waste, particularly house - hold medicine waste, as a safer and environmentally sustainable  disposal method to avoid posing hazardous risks to the environment and  human health. To tackle the "pharmaceuticals in the environment"  problem, Mitkidis and Mitkidis  proposed to redesign current  pharmaceutical takeback schemes and regulations to facilitate the  interdisciplinary research collaborations between the fields of psychol - ogy, law, public health, and medical science to mitigate the problem.  Moreover, the need for developing an integrated treatment system for  pharmaceutical waste  and designing green, effi- cient, and scalable extraction platforms and separation methods to  valorize the active pharmaceutical ingredients from pharmaceutical  waste  have been highlighted as the current chal- lenges faced towards sustainable pharmaceutical resource management.  4.3.5. Cluster 5: knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCW management  Healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes, as  the main producers of HCW, are responsible for segregation, collection,  in-site transportation, HCW pre-treatment, and HCW storage before  such waste is collected by common HCW treatment facility operators  . Therefore, training and monitoring programs  on hazards linked to HCW to increase awareness and responsibility  among healthcare personnel are crucial to implementing effective HCW  practices and management. Gonibeedu et al.  , in a study to  evaluate the knowledge, attitude, practice, and gaps in implementing  the HCW practices in the primary healthcare facilities in India, showed  that the efficiency scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice are 74%  , 63% , and 54% , respectively. They high- lighted the need for retraining all the personnel involved in the  healthcare facility and periodically supportive supervision by health  authorities to foster the implementation requirements. Parida et al.   observed that while only 68% of healthcare workers in an Indian  context know that the most important step in HCW management is waste  segregation, only 49% of them correctly answer the questions regarding  the associated hazards of HCW. Moreover, they found that laboratory  waste handling is the least understood area of HCW management. In  another survey to assess the awareness of biomedical waste manage - ment among dental students in Nepal, Singh et al.  denoted that  although the majority of the studied dental students  have  positive attitudes towards safe management of biomedical waste, more  than half of them have no idea of the guidelines laid down by the  Government. Including mandatory attendance in regular training  workshops in the annual performance evaluation of all staff to increase  compliance, in line with periodic monitoring, is the only way forward to  reinforce knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards achieving sus- tainable HCW management . Woromogo et al.   showed that a good level of knowledge among medical staff more  likely leads to favorable attitudes towards HCW management. Besides, a  good level of both knowledge and attitudes positively affects the asso- ciated HCW management practices, indicating the important role of  knowledge and attitudes in successfully adopting HCW management M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 13policies and strategies. However, Mannocci et al.  outlined the  need for cross-sectional studies to develop a standardized and method - ologically validated tool to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices  of healthcare professionals to better manage HCW activities. Due to the  differences in national legislation, the healthcare industry settings, ed- ucation systems, and cultural contexts, assessing the level of knowledge,  attitudes, and practices regarding HCW management seems challenging  and needs specific customizations on predesigned questionnaires.  5.Future research directions for HCW management towards a  CE transition  In general, despite its potential to contribute to the CE transition, the  healthcare industry has been overlooked in the CE discourse compared  to other sectors, such as food, plastic, and manufacturing industries. This  may be due to the single-use mindset of the healthcare industry setting  in the wake of infectious, toxic, and hazardous nature of different HCW  streams, which makes implementing CE strategies, such as "reuse",  "recycle", and "recover" more challenging than ever.  In particular, based on the results provided in previous sections,  potential research avenues for further research in the future regarding  HCW management towards implementing a CE are presented in this  section and summarized in Fig. 7. Overall, three lines of research were  identified to support the CE transition in the healthcare industry and  HCW management context as follows:   ≡Effective pharmaceutical waste management  From the CE perspective, the pharmaceutical industry has been  mainly focusing on reducing waste generation within the  manufacturing processes over the recent years. In general, the  pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, through the use of current  sustainability models (e.g., environmental quotient, environmental  factor, life cycle assessment, process mass intensity, and green  chemistry model), has reduced waste generation .  However, existing pharmaceutical waste research lacks a compre - hensive study of the role of consumers and their consumption pat- terns towards implementing a CE in the pharmaceutical industry. As  a result, developing a consumer-centric framework in line with CE  principles highly deserves to be considered by researchers in future  research to see how consumers could effectively contribute to  pharmaceutical waste reduction. Hence, some potential directions  would be  designing optimal return-back channels for expired  medicines and  developing medicine sharing platforms under the  required sanitary monitoring conditions for sharing unneeded or  unwanted medicines among local communities to maximize the idle  capacity , prevent the households pharma - ceutical waste generation, and increase the pharmaceutical resource  efficiency.   ≡Developing a CE transition framework for HCW management  activities all together  A few pieces of research regarding the adoption of a CE perspective  for healthcare organizations have been conducted recently. For  instance, Voudrias  highlighted some steps that should be  taken by healthcare facilities, including designing reusable items  instead of single-use materials, adequately measuring waste pro- duction, and taking waste mitigation actions. Moreover, Chauhan  et al.  proposed a smart HCW disposal system enabled by in- dustry 4.0 that takes CE perspectives into account. Nevertheless,  putting an integrated CE model in place to deal with HCW as a whole  is still lacking in the literature. A potential research direction for the  future is designing, developing, and implementing a comprehensive  CE transition model for HCW management as a whole, considering  all activities involved within the waste hierarchy. In particular, the  following five areas are recommended to be addressed in the future of the circular healthcare industry:  setting a clear agenda and  drafting a CE-oriented healthcare industry action plan,  educating  and, more importantly, activating healthcare facilities to change  their routine from single-use mindset to embracing the CE transition,   optimizing healthcare asset sharing platforms among healthcare  facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, and medical centers,  devel - oping CE indicators for the healthcare industry to adequately mea- sure and monitor the progress of HCW management strategies and  actions towards establishing a circular healthcare industry, and   encouraging cross-sectional partnership among medical de- partments, healthcare manufacturers, reprocessing companies, and  suppliers to  close, slow, or narrow healthcare supply chain loops,  and  develop reusing and reprocessing infrastructures towards  achieving a CE.  ≡Innovative solutions for creating circularity within the health - care industry business model  The complex issue of reusing and reprocessing healthcare materials,  products, and instruments has been discussed in the waste management  debate over recent years. On the one hand, disposable and single-use  materials and products are widely used to control infection in the  healthcare industry, increasing HCW generation. Replacing single-use  products with reusable ones can significantly reduce the rate of HCW  produced by healthcare facilities, particularly hospitals. For instance,  Kwakye et al.  denoted that a 1000-bed hospital is estimated to  reduce 15,500 waste kg/year and save 175,000 US$/year only by using  reusable sharp containers instead of disposable ones. On the other hand,  although reprocessing of single-use products by healthcare facilities,  which refers to reusing single-use products after repairing, cleaning, and  sterilizing, could save costs and reduce waste, it faces many challenges,  such as ethical, legal, and patient safety issues . The CE  discourse in the healthcare industry is still in its infancy stage and highly  needs more innovative approaches towards creating circularity and  closing the loops in delivering high-quality healthcare services with  fewer materials used and less HCW produced. Therefore, investigating  innovative solutions for creating circularity within the business model  and supply chain of the healthcare industry through policy incentives  and technological advancements is recommended as another potential  future research avenue. In this vein, three identified research areas to  support the CE transition in the healthcare industry are:  technolog - ical and methodological advancements for safely recovering as much  value as possible from HCW. Hence, various solutions should be devel - oped and investigated at different scales to ensure maximal energy re- covery from HCW streams. These solutions should be thoroughly  scrutinized using advanced sustainability assessment tools, which have  been effectively employed in various sectors of the waste management  and valorization domain, such as life cycle assessment (Khoshnevisan  et al., 2020; Rajaeifar et al., 2017 ), exergy analysis (Barati et al., 2017;  Tabatabaei et al., 2021 ), exergoeconomic analysis (Aghbashlo et al.,  2019b; Soltanian et al., 2019 ), and exergoenvironmental analysis  ;  optimizing trade-offs between  single-use and reusable healthcare materials, products, and instruments  to replace as much single-use as possible with reusable ones to close the  supply chain loops and maximize the healthcare resource efficiency; and   policy incentives to encourage financing in the HCW management  sector and enforcing authorities ’ regulations to foster the CE transition,  in particular within the context of developing countries.  6.Concluding remarks  The present research, as an attempt to map the past evolution and the  current status of HCW research and discover its main research themes  and trends, was conducted by following a mixed-method approach on  708 articles in WoS from 1985 to 2021. Having scrutinized the M. Ranjbari et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Hazardous Materials 422  126724 14literature, our study particularly contributes to the existing body of  knowledge of the HCW management domain by  providing a  comprehensive overview of HCW management research and its associ - ated research themes and trends, and  identifying research gaps and  proposing future avenues for research on sustainable HCW management  towards implementing a CE within the healthcare industry.  Based on the results, four main research themes of HCW manage - ment were identified, including  HCW minimization, sustainable  management, and policy-making,  HCW incineration and its associ - ated environmental impacts,  hazardous HCW management practices,  and  HCW handling, and occupational safety and training. Despite its  great potential to contribute to the CE transition, the findings showed  that the healthcare industry has been overlooked in the CE discourse  compared to other industries, such as food, plastic, and manufacturing.  This may be due to the single-use mindset of the healthcare industry  settings in the wake of infectious, toxic, and hazardous nature of  different HCW streams, which makes the implementation of CE strate - gies, such as "reuse", "recycle", and "recover" more challenging than ever.  Three research avenues were provided for further research towards  putting a CE in place for the healthcare industry and HCW management,  including  effective pharmaceutical waste management through  reduction of household pharmaceutical waste,  developing a CE  transition model for the healthcare industry and its associated HCW  management practices and activities as a whole, and  providing  innovative solutions for creating circularity within the business model  and also supply chain of the healthcare industry through policy in- centives and technological advancements.  The theoretical/practical implications of this inclusive review for  researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers involved in the healthcare  industry and HCW management practices are outlined herein. Re- searchers and scholars are served by  rendering a comprehensive  image of HCW management developments over time,  identifying the  most influential articles and journals that mainly have directed this field of study,  mapping collaboration networks of contributing countries,  institutions, and funding agencies,  providing hotspots in the HCW  management through employing keyword-based analyses,  unfolding  prominent research themes and subject areas which have shaped the  main body of knowledge in HCW management, and  drafting a  research agenda for the healthcare industry and accordingly HCW  management in line with CE principles. For practitioners, policy-makers,  and official authorities, the findings of the present study can be used as a  guideline to  increase the understanding of different HCW manage - ment practices, from waste identification and prediction to waste  disposal and incineration, and their impacts on the environment, human  health, and workers safety,  support implementing effective HCW  management practices according to CE principles towards a cleaner and  sustainable environment.  The present study is no exception to the limitations, which can be  addressed for further developments. Firstly, the non-English research  was excluded from the database used herein, although they may add  more value to the obtained results and provided insights. Secondly, the  WoS database was the only database of the current study, leading to  missing some relevant research in this area. And finally, we employed  bibliographic coupling as the data clustering technique to group the  articles for conducting content analysis in this research. Applying other  methods and algorithms to cluster articles might help improve the  clustering results and, accordingly, content analysis for future studies.
