Applying the principles of sustainable development in Romania involves a new  approach to ecological waste using basic concepts of circular economy to weigh accurately the  proposed projects in this area taking into account existing environmental resources and zero  waste objectives . The paper is focused on: quantitative and qualitative measures of waste  prevention in Romania, the changing status of the waste by selling it as product, the  mechanisms for paying for treatment and / or disposal which discourage waste generation and  the use of financial resources obtained from secondary raw materials for the efficiency of waste  management.  1.  Introduction  According to Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, Hans Bruyninck"circular  economy concept has advanced in European policy decision as a positive perspectives, based on  solutions for achieving economic development while respecting environmental limits”. Romanian  European Environment Agency is ready to support the transition towards a circular economy through  analyses and evaluations.  Unlike traditional perspective of linear economy, circular economy is trying to respect  environmental limits by increasing distribution of renewable or recycled resources and reducing the  consumption of raw materials and energy. Thus, both the emissions and resources wasting will be  reduced. Also, concepts such as eco design, distribution, reuse, repair, recycling of products and  materials will play an important role in maintaining the use and value of products, components and  materials. It is essential to move to a circular economy in order to meet the resource efficiency agenda  established under the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth . It can get  higher performance and sustainable efficient use of resources, which can bring major economic  benefits.  In the industrial sector, is already recognizes that improving resource productivity is a strong  business case. It is estimated that improving resource efficiency along the value chain could reduce  material needs with 17% -24% by 2030  and a better use of resources should be a general potential  saving of 630 billion per year for European industry  .  2.  Waste generation  Waste generation is highly dependent on local consumer habits, the type of buildings, general living  conditions and the type of industry and commerce. For example, in areas with individual fireplaces  with wood, coal or coke, waste is considerably more and denser in winter compared to buildings with  20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf.

In some societies waste are very wet in the autumn time and has a hig h  content of organic matter due to conservation of vegetables. This can be problematic for waste  incineration installations which may need additional fuel. Homes, with a relatively low income,  produce less waste but more organic than homes with a relatively high income. The single  measurement of waste generation there is made by weighing platforms from the landfill, recycling  stations and treatment facilities with quality recording of waste type and transport origin. Based on  these statistics, there are recorded quarterly/ or seasonal waste variations and can do prognosis.  2.1.  Waste classification  In terms of nature and places of production, waste is classified as follows:  1. Household waste  - waste from the household sector or other similar sectors (including hazardous  waste they contain) and can be taken by our current pre-collection systems or villages collection  systems;  2. Street waste  - specific waste of public traffic routes, from the daily activity of the population, city  green spaces, animals, deposition of solids in the atmosphere;  3. Similar waste with municipal waste  - waste from small or large industry, commerce, public and  administration sectors, which presents similar composition and properties to household waste and can  be collected, transported, processed and stored with them;  4. Bulky waste  - solid waste from different sources, which due to its size, cannot be taken with the  usual pre-collection or collection systems, but requires a differentiated treatment.  5. Construction waste  - waste from demolition of industrial and civil constructions;  6. Hazardous waste  - toxic, flammable, explosive, infectious waste or otherwise, which after was  introduced into the environment, can harm plants, animals or humans;  7. Agricultural waste  - waste from agricultural and livestock units (manure, animal waste from  slaughterhouses and meat industry);  8. Industrial waste  - waste from technological processes;  9. Hospital waste  - waste from the hospitals activities and health units which are incinerated in  crematoria;  Depending on specific local conditions, could be other types of waste that requires special attention,  for example, marine ballast  and mining waste.  2.2.  The main objectives of solid waste management  The main objectives of solid waste management are:  protect public health; protect the environment;  maintaining cleanliness in public for these places to be aesthetically acceptable; conservation of  natural resources through waste reduction policies and recycling. All these objectives are achieved  through a good collection and waste safe treatment, a proper waste storage and disposal. By my  opinion integrated waste management is vital for the community, for the following reasons:  1. The deposits capacity decreases continuously  -Location and construction of new deposits is a  difficult and expensive process.  2.Many waste materials are rare natural sources, imposing their recovery, decreasing the  environmental impact and increasing humans’ life quality.   3.The materials found in waste volume may be an opportunity to start a business.  4.A system that does not rely on one alternative is more flexible to economical, technological and  legislative changes.  5.The investors or creditors favour capital projects that are part of a carefully eco -designed strategy.  Local authorities are in an advantageous position in assessing the proposals for a new facility, when  they have the chance to thoroughly examine the entire system. Pollutant emissions from industry are  very rich and very diverse. In very vast area, some principles are advanced only to reduce emissions of  pollutants that need to be adapted for each industrial branch separately.  20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 161 012086 doi:10.1088/1757-899X/161/1/012086 2             3.  Industrial Product Life Cycle Stages  Life cycle approach means considering the environmental impacts and resources used throughout the  lifecycle of products .   Approaching life cycle helps us to identify sensitive points and aspects of a product which can be  improved as lower environmental impact, a reduced use of resources along the life cycle stages or  compromises between different options on products. Sensitive issues can arise at any stage of the life  cycle, from raw material extraction and conversion, and manufacturing and distribution, to customer  use and / or consumption.   It ends with reuse, recycling, energy recovery and final disposal. The key objective of lifecycle  based approach is to contribute to decisions or express any managerial transfer of responsibility. This  means minimizing impacts on the environment in a life cycle stage or in a geographic region or a  certain category of impacts, while helping to avoid environmental impacts increase elsewhere. For  example, saving energy during the use phase of a product without simultaneously increase the amount  of material required for its delivery and impacts associated with this supply.  At each stage of the life cycle there are raw materials consumed and chemicals are released as  emissions. They contribute to different environmental impacts and issues like resource scarcity.  4.  Measures to reduce waste, in order to achieve a circular economy in Romania  Circular economy approaches, exclude concept of waste and usually involve innovation along the  value chain, rather than rely on solely solutions for the life cycle end of a product. For example, these  approaches may include:  1. Reducing the amount of material required to provide a given service;  2. Extending the useful product life cycle ;  3. Reducing the use of energy and materials within production of use phases ;  4. Reducing the use of hazardous materials or difficult to recycle into new products and production  processes ;  5. The creation of markets for secondary raw materials, based on standards and public acquisitions  ;  6. Designing products that are easily maintained, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled  ;  7. Development of services that consumers need to reduce waste ;  8.Stimulating and supporting the activities of waste reduction and quality separation, made by  consumers;  9. Stimulating the separation and collection systems that minimize the costs of recycling and reuse;  10.Facilitating group activities to prevent the transformation in waste of industrial products  (industrial  symbiosis) and encouraging the expansion and consumers choice improvement. In this case the  customer could use leasing and exchange of services as an alternative to holding of products. We need  to protect consumers’ interests (in terms of cos t, protection, information, contract terms, issues related  to insurance, etc.).  In order to show the relationship between industrial product lifecycle and industrial emissions, I  have realized a matrix named “ Eco-friendly methods for reduction of industrial pollutant emissions –  Industrial Product Life Cycle Stages Matrix” table 1.  According with Luminiţa I. POPA and VasileN.POPA ,the Industrial Product Life Cycle Stages are  the follows: market needs; research and development; idea generation; opportunity identification and  concept definition; research design and development; prototype &production; distribution and  manufacturing; marketing; sales; maintenance &service; products feed-back; removal& disposal. As  we can see in the matrix”  research and development ” and “research design and development “ lifecycle  stages have the highest score: 7.  Another two lifecycle stages , have a  high score: 6. In this case, the industrial company managers have to take in consideration that these  three metrics are very important, because they could affect the entire industrial product life cycle. Also  20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 161 012086 doi:10.1088/1757-899X/161/1/012086 3             another three metrics,”Eco -friendly production output” ,’Eco -friendly operational life cycle”   and”Implementing TQM method”  are the most important w ays to reduce the cost  of green acquisitions.

European Union Resource efficient Scoreboard  The Resource Efficiency Scoreboard presents indicators covering themes and subthemes of the  Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe . The scoreboard aims to monitor the implementation of the  roadmap, to communicate the link between resources and economy and to engage stakeholders.  Indicators are arranged in three groups – lead, dashboard and theme-specific indicators.  For several  indicators it is more meaningful to view the data at country level rather than at EU-28 level. The  scoreboard by default presents the data for Belgium, the first country in the Member States list (sorted  in protocol order). Data for the EU and other Member States were selected from the country list.  6.  EU indicators:  “Turning waste into a resource”   6.1.  Waste excluding major mineral wastes  20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 161 012086 doi:10.1088/1757-899X/161/1/012086 4             The indicator shows trends in waste generation, both EU-wide and for individual EU countries. It  covers both non-hazardous and hazardous waste from: all sectors of the economy ;  households . It does not cover mineral wastes or soil. Over 90% of these come from the  mining and construction sectors, which are subject to considerable fluctuation over time. Waste  generation from which major mineral wastes are excluded reflects general trends more accurately  than statistics on total waste generated. The indicator shows the amount of waste generated annually in  the EU as a whole and in individual countries, expressed in kilos per inhabitant.  It is based on data  collected in the way stimulated by the Waste Statistics Regulation and is available for every second  year as of reference year 2004  (source: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/waste/generation- of- waste-excluding-major-mineral-wastes  ).  6.2.  Landfill rate of waste excluding major mineral wastes  The indicator is defined as the volume of waste landfilled  in a country per year  divided by the volume of the waste treated in the same year. Waste taken into account excludes major  mineral wastes, dredging spoils and contaminated soils. This exclusion enhances comparability across  countries, as mineral waste accounts for high quantities in some countries due to economic activities  such as mining and construction. One exception, however, is that the indicator explicitly includes  combustion wastes and solidified, stabilised and vitrified wastes, despite them being completely or  partly mineral. The indicator is derived from the two-yearly reporting of the countries according to the  Waste Statistics Regulation. It covers landfilling of hazardous  and non-hazardous  waste from  all economic sectors and from households, including waste from waste treatment (secondary  waste)..  6.3.  Recycling rate of municipal waste  The recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste divided by the total municipal waste  arising. Recycling includes material recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion. Municipal waste  consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, but may also include similar wastes  generated by small businesses and public institutions and collected by the municipality; this latter part  of municipal waste may vary from municipality to municipality and from country to country,  depending on the local waste management system. For areas not covered by a municipal waste  collection scheme the amount of waste generated is estimated.   .  6.4.  Electrical and electronic equipment waste   WEEE poses on the one hand a risk to the environment , on the other hand it  has a high potential for recycling to replace raw materials by secondary raw materials, such as  precious metals and other highly valuable special materials. For the calculation of recycling rates it is  crucial to know the volume of end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment. As this is for many  devices and many countries difficult to deduct, the volume of put on the market during the previous 3  years  is considered as proxy for the volume of WEEE in the reference  year . The collection rate is calculated  as the collected volume of WEEE in the reference year, divided by the average sum of EEE put on the  market in the three previous years. The ‘recycling rate of e -waste’  equals the ‘total  collection’ in the present year divided by the average of the ‘put on the market’ of the three preceding  years multiplied with the ‘reuse and recycling rate’ , considering that the total  amount of collected e-waste is sent to treatment / recycling  facilities..        20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf.

Using th e indicator ”Recycling rate of e-waste ”  for Romania and EU, it is made an average of  three  as following:  Romania: 13,125; European Union: 31,433; it is chosen this period of  time because there is after 2007, the year in which Romania has become full member of European  Union.This relevant indicator shows that Romania is 2,4 times less efficient in the field of „Recycling  rate of e- waste” than EU countries. Using the indicator “Recycling rate of municipal waste”    for Romania and EU, it is made an average of three years  as following:  Romania:  13,125; European Union: 56,425; it is chosen this period of time because there is after 2007, the year  in which Romania has become full member of European Union.This relevant indicator shows that  Romania is 4. 3 times less efficient in the field of „Recycling rate of municipal waste” than EU  countries .

Comparison of domestic material consumption indicator. Romania vs. European Union   Domestic Material Consumption  is based on the Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts   . Comparison of domestic material consumption indicator ,“Romania vs. European  Union ”is shown in the table 3. The classification of materials used in EW-MFA and for which DMC is  calculated is a Eurostat based system. EW-MFA includes the material categories:  1.Biomass and biomass products;  2.Metal ores and concentrates, raw and processed;  3.Non-metallic minerals, raw and processed;  20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 161 012086 doi:10.1088/1757-899X/161/1/012086 6             4.Petroleum resources, raw and processed;  5.Other products;  6.Waste imported for final treatment and disposal.  It is important to note that the term "consumption" as used in DMC denotes apparent consumption and  not final consumption. DMC does not include upstream hidden flows related to imports and exports of  raw materials and products. The indicator is a Resource Efficiency Indicator. It has been chosen as a  lead indicator presented in the Resource Efficiency Scoreboard for the assessment of progress towards  the objectives of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative on Resource Efficiency. The DMC is defined as  the total amount of material directly used in an economy and equals direct material input  minus  exports Domestic material consumption –is represented in “tonnes per capita”.

Conclusions  The transition benefits towards a circular economy in Europe could be considerable by reducing  environmental pressures reducing drastically Romanian economy dependence on imports which, if  gradual increases, can become a source of national vulnerability.   Increasing global competition for natural resources has contributed to increased prices and  volatility. Also circular economy strategies applied could have as effect of reducing costs and  increased competitiveness of Romanian industry by net benefits which consist of job opportunities.  Creating a circular economy in Romania requires fundamental changes in the value chain, from  product design and production processes to new models of circularity business and consumption  patterns.   In this manner, recycling will turn waste into a resource, and product life extension facility will  contribute to reducing natural resources consumption.  20th Innovative Manufacturing Engineering and Energy Conference  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 161 012086 doi:10.1088/1757-899X/161/1/012086 9             Some Romanian companies are already are experimenting new circularity business models such as  those based on functions and services of collaborative consumption model specific for circular  economy. For the future Romanian managers could take some measures for waste reduction: the  changing status of the waste by selling it as product; the mechanisms for paying for treatment and / or  disposal which discourage waste generation; the use of financial resources obtained from secondary  raw materials for the efficiency of waste management.
