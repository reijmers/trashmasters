and future research  
The plastic companies  in the country  reuse/reprocess  the scrap 
left from the production  lines. This prevents  the scrap to end-up  
in landﬁlls  and damage  environment.  Nevertheless,  the reprocess  
means more energy  is needed  to recover  material  through  post- 
industrial  pellets.  Thus, more analysis  is needed  to evaluate  the to- 
tal damage  done to the environment  between  the two choices  by 
life cycle assessment,  which is a systematic  analysis  of the envi- 
ronmental  impact  of products  during their entire life cycle (pro- 
duction,  use and disposal  phases).  
This ﬁrst attempt  to demonstrate  the mechanical  recyclability  
of EPS single use products,  in Ecuador,  proves the potential  for the 
development  of a circular  economy  around  this type of waste ma- 
terial. However,  more trials are need to be set in place to diminish  
the difference  in values for weight  and resistance.  In practice,  un- 
fortunately,  remelting  and forming  new post-consume  resin often 
degrades  the properties  of the recycled  items products.  Thus, the 
amount  of virgin resin shall increase  to keep the quality  of the ﬁ- 
nal product  and some waste will always be created.  
Also, in order to develop  a circular  economy  around  domes-  
tic waste, people need to participate  in the process  of separa-  
tion. Studies  indicate  that when made available  people will use 
the colored  recycle  bins. Government  intervention  is important,  
to surveillance  and reinforcement  of already  made policies,  for 
managing  possible  recycling  items. Also, reprocess  companies  must 
have the technology  to decontaminate  the polymers  before melting  
and resell high quality  recycled  plastic raw material  to the manu- 
facturers.
