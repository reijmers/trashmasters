4.1. Data and method's gaps
Quilombola communities in Brazil are mostly located in rural areas;
therefore, they are often neglected with respect to provisioning services,
including solid waste management. Lima and Paulo (2018) veriﬁed that
the residents of these communities are, among other hazards, exposed to
risks associated with open air burning of solid waste, when the munici-
pality does not provide some type of waste collection service. It was
conﬁrmed in this study that besides social risks, the residents are exposed
to major environmental risks when more than 70% of the residents still
practice open air burning. Even with big changes in the scenario, that is, a
very optimistic approach, the population is still exposed to high envi-
ronmental burdens. The results presented here can be extrapolated to
rural areas of Brazil in general, as the conditions are similar across the
country as veri ﬁed by Andrino et al. (2018) .
We veri ﬁed that the current scenario results in high normalisedenvironmental burdens in all impact categories, which can be inferred to
be the current situation in most rural communities globally. The human
toxicity category, with 51,112 mPE per ton of waste, represents a large
amount of toxic substances that may affect human health in the form of
different types of diseases. As for freshwater ecotoxicity, 9940 mPE has a
signiﬁcant impact on freshwater ecosystems, caused by toxic elements in
air, soil, and water. These examples show how important a change in
waste management scenario is for these communities, because not only
can human health be affected, but also our water ecosystems, etc.
Published research on waste LCA in rural areas is scarce globally and
generally very speci ﬁc, making it dif ﬁcult to compare results across
different studies. Yadav and Samadder (2018) assessed the impacts of
open burning of waste in an urban context in India. They obtained
9420 kg CO 2eq. for a scenario that also includes open dumping and
landﬁlling, which is higher than our result due to the additional contri-
butions, but it nevertheless illustrates how impactful this practice is.
Open burning can trigger a variety of health impacts, such as acute and
chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, in
addition to impacts on local climate. The smoke that is emitted contains
PM, carcinogenic dioxins, and numerous other harmful pollutants such as
nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), and
non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) ( Das et al., 2018 ).
Therefore, it is important that the communities that still perform this
practice are not neglected with regard to providing adequate waste
disposal means; on the contrary, they require special attention to mini-
mise the social and environmental impacts they are exposed to.
Even though land ﬁlling has its own restrictions and is associated with
high environmental burdens ( Lima et al., 2018 ;Yadav and Samadder,
