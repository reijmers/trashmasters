s and discussion
The results are ﬁrst presented for the functional unit of 1 t of house-
hold FW treated, starting with the environmental impacts and followed
by the life cycle costs. The environmental and economic implications of
managing household FW at the UK level are discussed in Section 3.3 .
3.1. Life cycle environmental impacts
The environmental impacts of the four waste management routes
for the treatment of 1 t of food waste are presented in Fig. 4 and
Table S7 in the SI. The results refer to the average, minimum and maxi-
mum inventory values in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7 . The minimum and maxi-
mum values have been used in the uncertainty analysis to estimate the
90th and 10th percentile values of the impacts, shown as error bars in
Fig. 4 .
As can be inferred from Fig. 4 , in the average case, anaerobic diges-
tion has the lowest impacts for 13 out of 19 categories, including global
warming potential. Incineration has the best values for marine eutro-
phication and agricultural land occupation, and land ﬁll for terrestrial
acidiﬁcation, particulate matter formation and natural land transforma-
tion. In-vessel composting is overall the worst option, with 12 impacts
being higher than for any other method. However, its urban landoccupation is the lowest among the alternatives considered. Land ﬁlling
leads to the highest global warming potential, alongside human toxicity,
marine eutrophication and urban land occupation. Incineration is the
least preferred method for metal depletion, freshwater eutrophication
and particulate matter formation. These results are discussed in more
detail in the following sections.
3.1.1. Primary energy demand (PED)
For the average case, AD has a net-negative PED of −1.93 GJ/t FW.
This is primarily attributable to the grid electricity displaced but also
to the avoided production of mineral fertilisers. Incineration with en-
ergy also has a net-negative PED ( −0.9 GJ/t FW) for the average case,
but this is highly dependent on the ef ﬁciency of energy recovery and
parasitic use. For example, in the 90th percentile case, the electricity
from FW cannot cover the parasitic load and the system becomes a
net user of energy (0.07 GJ/t FW). The modest recovery of energy
from the land ﬁll gas is not suf ﬁcient to exceed the energy demand of
the land ﬁll process and, in the average case, it is a net consumer with
a PED of 0.14 GJ/t FW. In the 10th percentile case, where land ﬁll gas cap-
ture rate approaches the upper range of 85%, the process becomes a net
saver of PED at −0.15 GJ/t FW. IVC has the highest PED, with 1.31 GJ/t
FW in the average case and ranging from 0.82 to 1.99 GJ/t FW. This is
due to the energy-intensive air handling system required for theTable 5
