less studies than other regions Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Introduction The principal premises of a circular economy CE have emerged as closed and slowing loops in which closed loops pertain to post consumer waste recycling slowing refers to product value reten tion through maintenance repair and refurbishment and rema nufacturing to produce ef ciency improvements in the ordinary linear economy Bocken et al a Kirchherr et al A CE emerges when the value of resources materials and products is preserved as long as possible in the economy and the generation of waste serves as a tactic to develop lowcarbon resource ef ciency and competitive sustainability Pires and Martinho Waste management particularly solid waste management SWM andmunicipal solid waste management MSWM is the foundation for a CE to achieve more waste prevention and better resource man agement by extending and closing the material cycles that account for waste inputoutput to create inventories of economic ows Kalmykova et al Zeller et al However the relation ships between MSWM and CE entities are blurred in the existing literature and these concepts are diffuse since they were proposed by different viewpoints in different elds Geissdoerfer et al Corresponding ways of theoretical understanding remain unclear because of deliberation regarding MSWM and CE concepts Anshassi et al Blomsma and Brennan Bocken et al b Nevertheless geographic advantages are achieved through supplementary ef cient material cycles and reverse logistics with synergistic proximity to municipal waste sources and potential industrial source involvement Van Berkel et al For instance Zeller et al argued that adequate resource mea sures for effective market supply and demand and the ability to form municipal organizations

regional CE knowledge is needed to foster environmental outcomes and the total resource management chain Understanding MSWM in a CE at the regional level is necessary to improve practices As previously mentioned MSWM in a CE remains limited and qualitative and quantitative approaches and analyses are lacking Korhonen et al a Pires and Martinho Zeller et al There are challenges and opportunities for the development of MSWM in a CE since MSWM is increasingly complex and a CE has problems in practice while a systematic literature examination indicates that the contributions of MSWM in a CE remain unrevised and need to be clari ed Sys tematic qualitative and quantitative approaches provide an over view of the state of the art of MSWM in a CE for future study directions and improvements in practice The objectives of this study are as follows CTo describe MSWM in a CE and map the eld with proposed indicators from valid data sources CTo explore the knowledge gaps in geographical regions based on a proposed hybrid approach Quantitative and qualitative approaches are proposed to enhance the outcomes of the systematic review A hybrid method including bibliometric analysis the fuzzy Delphi method and the entropy weight method is proposed Bibliometric analysis is used to visualize an overview of the bibliometric status and to reveal the indicators of MSWM in a CE from the data of all publications in the Scopus database and the results are presented as visual informa tion Shukla et al The fuzzy Delphi method aims to screen out unnecessary indicators based on expert judgments due to the complexity of a CE and the diversity of problems Tseng Tseng and Bui The entropy weight method is applied to transform the indicator frequency data into comparable weights to determine the performance of regions on the indicators and to identify the critical indicators for improvement in this study Wang et al Tseng This study contributes to identifying important knowledge to assist further studies and the implementation of practices delivering guidelines regarding the directions of future studies by reviewing the bibliometric status of MSWM in a CE and identifying the critical indicators that need further examination and addressing the challenges and gaps among geographical regions to provide local viewpoints of MSWM in a CE The second section discusses related literature on a CE and MSWM The third section more clearly presents the data collection process methodologies and proposed analytical steps The results are revealed in the fourth section The fth section identi es future challenges and discusses regional comparisons of MSWM in a CE Finally conclusions are drawn in the last section Literature review Municipal solid waste management MSWM is de ned as complex procedures comprising waste collection routes transfer station locations treatment and energy recovery strategies and waste treatment techniques are the core means to achieve objectives including human health and envi ronmental protection economic development and ful llment of social and regulatory requirements Dewi et al Sharholy et al claimed that ef cient MSWM requires support from both authorities and citizens where the latter are individuals with evolving community awareness and societal interest Soltani et al presented that MSWM is a complex procedure involvingmultiple decisive factors such as environmental effects related economic outlays and bene ts regional features and political and social issues Therefore sustainable MSWM is necessary for all stages of the system from design scheduling and neutralization to the preservation of environmental quality for future development goals Pires et al It is necessary to identify planning and monitoring methods for SWM to reduce the generated amount of waste to recycle some waste with high economic value and to dene indicators that support that a suitable direction is important Arkan et al For solid waste intervention in a CE Lee developed a recycling investment sustainability framework that involves un certain petitions and nonlinear recycling expenses to balance existing manufacturing restrictions production bene ts and recycling investments for a sustainable CE Tisserant et al presented waste treatment and waste footprint scales to design and assess policy instruments for a CE Murphy and Pincetl showed that material ows are rounded up in a CE with mate rials being used repeatedly to optimize consumption with no wasted materials the products are reused repaired or redis tributed within the system at the end of life If they cannot bereused or repaired products can be recycled or recovered from waste and used as inputs replacing the need to exploit natural resources Song et al Ghisellini et al andRicha et al suggested that a CE aims to prevent and eliminate waste by cycling materials or used products within a closedloop scheme to obtain energy and resource effectiveness and pro tability Ness and Xing proposed that a CE aims to have no remaining in uence on the ecosystem by recovering resource procurement damage while minimizing the waste produced through manufacturing and product life cycles Waste reduction through recycling is stressed under the principal points of reducing raw material consumption designing products in an ecodesign manner lengthening product lifetimes through maintenance and repair and recycling and using products and raw materials recovered from waste ows However theoretical developments are not coherent for this concept and do not align with MSWM and a CE because zerowaste perceptions are limited as even in closedloop systems resources are consumed and at least some waste is certainly produced Blomsma and Brennan Niero and Kalbar In lieu of this discussion the role of MSWM in a CE is irreplaceable and important for guaranteeing the precision of this supplementary approach Circular economy A CE is a business operationalization concept whose imple mentation for sustainable development has been much debated The concept stems from the Earth s limited capability to acclimatize to contamination in reaction to the necessity of economic devel opment and resource consumption along with environmental in uences Korhonen et al a Jiao and Boons indicated that the concept involves the actions of reducing reusing and recycling in the progression of production consumption and cir culation Van Buren et al proposed creating a triple bottom line with the social environmental and economic dimensions of a CEMendoza et al stated that a CE should take full advantage of resource ef ciency including conserving and improving natural wealth by monitoring nite stocks and assessing renewable resource ows optimizing resource utility products processes and materials within technological and biological circularity and promoting ef cient coordination by disclosing and controlling undesirable externalities Ness and Xing suggested that a CE aims to achieve more value and to reduce material throughput by involving resource utilization and management closedloop ap proaches adaptation strategies and sharing economy modelsFM Tsai TD Bui ML Tseng et al Journal of Cleaner Production In contrast waste prevention in a CE includes reuse refurbish ment and remanufacturing of material ows Pires and Martinho The fundamentals surpass a reuse loop and include rema nufacturing recycling and reprocessing to recover secondary components and return them to the same usage Some endoflife products and materials might shift to other processes such as ex ports for reuse in another location change to lower applications downcycling or be discharged from the system in the form of waste Korhonen et al a Palomar et al The increasing growth in prior studies informs an evidencebased formulation of a CE and its implications for innovation Kirchherr et al conceptualized a model from the most frequent depictions of a CE by reviewing de nitions Reike et al explored con troversies in a CE through a focus on reviewing the literature and resource value retention options to provide a heuristic that is useful in practice Lacson et al revealed uoride networks and a CE as potential models for sustainable development because discard ing of existing waste is reliant on incineration and the problems posed by land lling in a linear economy model worsen environ mental problems The initial uncertainty and con icts regarding a CE remain due to various practical activities Identifying CE challenges in a sustainable global network scheme is an urgent problem Korhonen et al a A systematic review of MSWM in a CE is still lacking in the literature MSWM in a CE from regional perspectives Geographic advantage is achieved through supplementary ef cient material cycles and reverse logistics Adequate resource proximity measures for market supply and demand effectiveness and the shaping capability of municipal planning and regulation frameworks are considered fundamental to a region s unique po sition in a CE system Zeller et al For instance the European Union is currently leading in policy implementation and endorsing new ambitious procedures to promote a CE with the most modern waste legislation European Commission The concept in volves reusable products and recyclable materials such as metals plastics paper and glass and producing goods from organic waste Zeller et al Performing CE functions to upcycle waste management is pigeonholed by the use of materials labor and capital in each speci c region and its technology andor innovation level Omoloso et al In North America including the United States a CE highlights waste reduction reuse and recycling over disposal Van Ewijk and Stegemann Japan and China are the key players in Asia to of cially present a CE Geng et al worked on CO reductions for situations of municipal symbiosis in Kawasaki Japan Fang et al indicated carbon footprint and resource savings in Chinese national pilot cities More nuanced grading with tinier decision loops such as restructuring refur bishing and repurposing to enable resource value retention over multiple product life cycles has recently been emphasized in a CE Reike et al Stahel argued that a CE of reused products and recycling materials is ordinary in lessdeveloped regions where the CE begins with an endoflife product that is utilized to yield new con sumption under a gravetocradle assessment thus this approach reduces both the volume of waste generated in the lower value chain and the demand for virgin resources in the upper value chain However Diaz claimed that the original causes of low levels of a CE in countries such as those in Latin America and the Carib bean and Africa are weak political motivation a lack of national waste management policy and legislation inadequate budgets to implement a CE and a lack of professional expertise training and education at all levels These causes led to the occurrence of informal reuse recycling and recovery markets and raised variousquestions regarding the CE concept Therefore exploring MSWM in a CE is expected to improve the economy conserve the environ ment and protect social fairness by offering an alternative model that is cyclical and reformative and that replaces traditional linear processes

Proposed analytical steps This study provides a datadriven bibliometric analysis from a literature review identifying indicators for improving further studies and for accurately determining the differences in the status of research on MSWM in a CE in different regions The analytical steps followed are as follows The search terms are identi ed and the publication database is ltered using the Scopus website Bibliographic analysis is then conducted to nd the indicators of MSWM in a CE from the database using VOSviewer software The fuzzy Delphi method is adopted to re ne the essential in dicators Experts opinions from a questionnaire are used to assess the proposed indicators The frequencies of the indicators are generated and the entropy weight method is applied to transform the entropy of the in dicators into comparable scales In this study regional com parisons are carried out The critical indicators are identi ed by subtracting the global weight of the fuzzy Delphi method from the entropy weight to examine the study gaps The details of the analytical process are described in Fig Data collection Appendix A presents the literature review of studies on a CE or MSWM that engaged in a systematic analysis approach The Scopus database is employed in this study due to its wider coverage of publications and greater amount of relevant bibliometric data than those of other databases He et al Jin et al Meho and Rogers The collected data consist of several identi ers the title abstract citation record author author af liation author keywords country and year of

components including food paper plastics metals textiles and glass it differs based on different cultures policies and legislation and depends on the main economic features of regions Burnley Solid waste refers to the waste generated by local communities industrial zones com mercial areas conventional construction sites demolition pro cesses and civic services Ngoc and Schnitzer It contains all products associated with daily activities such as packaging bottles discarded food newspapers equipment devices batteries and dyes Municipal solid waste refers to waste in a solid form produced in the course of daily activities by households and industrial institutional and commercial establishments waste from schools ofces institutions stores hotels and supermarkets and from communal services such as yards markets hospitals entertain ment venues and street cleaning Arkan et al Yukalang et al As a result the following search terms were usedFM Tsai TD Bui ML Tseng et al Journal of Cleaner Production circular economy or circular economic and solid waste or urban waste or ewaste or electronic waste or construction waste or household waste or demolition waste or plastic waste or medical

publication additionally the results were limited to only English articles and reviews A total of articles and reviews were generated with the rst published in proving that MSWM in a CE is a concept from the last decade Bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis investigates the formal properties of knowledge domains by using mathematical and statistical methods Fahimnia et al referred to bibliometric analysis as a tool that provides powerful network analysis to identify established and emerging topical areas based on study topic author and institu tional characteristics Zupic and CCater proposed that the method is a quantitative technique to handle increasing amounts of existing literature In particular bibliometric analysis provides in formation about a study eld and helps make handling a largenumber of publications easier and more reliable deeply ana lyzes the relationships among articles citations cocitations and keywords and provides strong visualization ability which helps readers easily and clearly identify future research interests in aeld Feng et al Therefore this method has the potential to be applied to explore CEs as a knowledge sphere that has not yet been fully understood Ertz and LeblancProulx The bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer software van Eck and Waltman The VOSviewer open source software tool offers suf cient features to scienti cally map the literature through document grouping that categorizes documents into expressive relationships by grouping documents that are related to each other into one cluster to describe the network among them In the academic eld VOSviewer has been applied to map knowledge in arti cial intelligence Shukla et al green building construction Wuni et al and SWM Deus et al Thus VOSviewer is appropriate for visualizing a biblio metric network and identifying the MSWM indicators in a CE in this study through bibliographic coupling among the nodes this coupling denotes the topic area and represents the countries and the linkages in the keywords of previous studies This study uses this software to generate bibliometric information including Fig Analytical procedure Note ofmsw Organic

et al First a content analysis as a tool to study documents and communication objects based on systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts Hodder was employed for regional consistency checks of the codes independent of particular regions To avoid repeating the same completed coding and to enhance the reliability of the results all coding was tracked in a parallel Excel le The indicator frequencies for each region were counted by searching regional data generated from publications on MSWM in a CE using country codes shown in Appendix B For instance the search term

Equations e The entropy weight method is used to re ect the utility value of an indicator and gives reliable weights when reviewing imperfect data The entropy weight method uses entropy to represent the size of information Entropy is a measure of how disorganized a system is when weighting an indicator an indicator with a large entropy meansthat it has a great diversity of responses and a more signi cant inuence on the system Tseng et al The greater the value of an indicator is the more information that it contains This means that the larger the entropy value is the smaller the entropy weight He et al The smaller the entropy weight is the more in formation that is contained in the indicator Hence this study uses the weighted average method to identify the level of information contained in the indicators for each region If the weight is greater than the average the indicator shows a need for improvement Fig Cooccurrence of author keywords by publication year Fig

waste is disposed of either by land lling or through incineration In fact waste incineration has recently become a fascinating treatment method Continuous increases in waste generation the absence of funding for land lls and their environmental and public health impacts have prompted anincreased interest in incineration Sebastian et al Inciner ation is a process of burning municipal solid waste to sterile ash with little environmental impact In optimal energy recovery and ecological sustainability incineration decreases the amount of waste by and the volume of mass by it also provides a possibility of recovering energy in the form of electricity Joseph et al Sebastian et al Ashraf et al proposed a clean closedloop incineration procedure that utilizes municipal solid waste residues and helps reduce expensive land ll taxes The feasibility of municipal solid waste incineration is determined by the composition of the municipal solid waste which is the most crucial criterion in contrast the sustainable MSWM selections that are made pose a threat to the environment AlSalem et al Although incineration is supposed to be a pathway to sustainable MSWM it may not always be a feasible discarding technique as it largely depends on the waste characteristics which are dependent on the indigenous demography sociocultural differences seasonal changeability and landscape Rajaeifar et al Incineration is a multifaceted complicated process with tradeoffs among numerous dimensions with a costintensive requirement for an extensive practicability assessment of implementation In practice the possibility of using incineration outputs such as ash carbon dioxide and energy to make cementing material through novel production stages allows a reproduction process

indicator helps to evaluate ecological effects there is a scarcity of information about how where and to what extent it is applicable to MSWM Laurent et al a As a result some speci c worst practices have arisen in isolated stages of LCA such as repeated neglect in performing the primary objectives of LCA at a substantiated level and a lack of transparency among system possibilities Laurent et al a Another de ciency is that LCA is strongly depen dent on local site situations which have diverse system boundaries curtailing in uencing factors and causing dif culties in inventory performance because of a lack of information on the local waste composition and a failure to perform sensitivity and uncertainty evaluation Laurent et al b Furthermore this method has not been extensively adopted for waste prevention and is limited to solid waste categories such as household and construction waste Das et al There is still potential to improve LCA in the context of MSWM in a CE An amended LCA approach that in tegrates environmental economic social legal institutional and technological aspects is still necessary for the sustainable man agement of solid waste Pereira and Fernandino Plastic waste Plastic waste exists in the construction packaging and auto motive sectors as well as in other sectors It is one of the most prevalent types of waste as a consequence of its popular use and short lifetime Ragaert et al Most plastic wastes are non biodegradable and take dozens of decades to degrade naturally All kinds of this waste can begin to degrade by breaking down the chemical bonds thus releasing free radicals and speeding up polymer chain degradation causing unsanitary land lls and aggregating environmental in uences Singh et al In terms of the consumption of large plastic

lack of information on the types of products and applications and the polymers and contamination in plastic waste limits the ability to identify the recycling potential thus chal lenging the design of recovery facilities system improvements and overall waste management systems Faraca and Astrup Although plastic waste recovery has been acknowledged infor mation about the composition and characteristics of problematic plastic waste is scarce and unavailable There are still gaps that make it challenging to replace disposable plastic products with environmentally friendly products in an optimal solution The result is an important turning point in the context of rising costs and a lack of recycling for developing real solutions to address the rapid rise of global plastic consumption

environment after being discharged Furthermore current legislation is not environmentally friendly Sorting solid waste Municipal solid waste is rich in various valuable recyclable materials such as plastic glass paper and metal Effective MSWM can facilitate valuable recyclable material recovery and reduce environmental damage Waste sorting is a crucial stage in MSWM for material recycling and should receive more attentionGundupalli et al Minelgait e and Liobikien e t o develop and test a sorting and quality assessment method Thus the general reason for studying the quantity and quality of solid waste is to reduce the number of items disposed Hossain and Roy The quality of waste sorting is insuf cient and different types of waste are mixed together additional separation processes are always essential for waste recycling Leeabai et al The role of social in uence is particularly important for handling the uncertainty of personal recycling responsibility It is essential to understand

hold solid waste has received signi cant global attention and waste sorting is regarded as an effective tool to reduce the waste disposal volume A comparison of motivation eintention ebehavior in regard to household solid waste sorting has been carried out to enhance our understanding of the determinants of household solid waste sorting behavior Fan et al Winwin results in waste sorting behavior were suggested to identify differences in waste separation performance among handling systems Nguyen and Watanabe As a precondition for the cumulative circularity of resource ows in the economy waste is preserved in discrete resource varieties to improve the effectiveness and cost of different waste treatment and sorting mechanisms Nainggolan et al However in developing and developed countries low recycling levels of solid waste are evident There is no clear concept of quality assessment and the results of solid waste sorting are very uncer tain Nrup et al It is necessary to identify processes that promote waste separation in effective ways as well as proposed methods to identify precise waste thus the potential for enhancing collection is essential There are still gaps for further study on thepotential for minimizing and separating waste Research on the completion of waste sorting equipment lines the development of recycling the minimization of waste at the source and at transfer points before sorting and treatment processes and sorting without dedicated activities is needed to focus and deploy SWM at many levels to meet the requirements of daily life Sustainability CE thinking highlights reduction reuse recycling and recovery including energy recovery through waste incineration with a focus on the net environmental or sustainable output over the nal discharge Chen et al a b Kirchherr et al Malinauskaite et al Silva et al However regional and local waste information systems are often not available or reliable and cannot be restricted to assist decisionmaking processes and to handle the challenges of integrated management Although sustain ability practices have been implemented many regions and localities still present poor waste management As unsustainable MSWM has increased concerns overoverconsumption and its consequences have grown signi cantly da Silva et al Nevertheless less infor mation has been obtained from the cultural perspective and changes in the generation of socioenvironmental problems have been ques tioned in the eld of MSWM de Souza Melar Cee ta l Martinez Alier Pereira and Fernandino In addition the continuous escalation of MSWM has brought serious global attention to management of waste in a sustainable manner and to SWM decisions Pujara et al MSWM is a crosscutting problem that affects all sustainability domains triple bottom line and emphasizes the position of combining its political precedence Rodi Cc and Wilson The use of sustainability in dicators for calculations by public administrators and metropolitan employees is also common Pereira and Fernandino evalu ated the MSWM quality in a coastal metropolis and tested the implementation of a system of indicators A relevant set of sus tainability indicators was selected to investigate MSWM in large and mediumsized cities worldwide and was applied in three municipalities da Silva et al An overview has been provided to an extensive range of existing MSWM strategies with the main purposes of designating present technologies innovative strate gies and monitoring assessments that prevail in waste manage ment situations in different regions as well as possible approaches to sustainable solid waste recycling and utilization Das et al Based on existing studies holistic approaches to monitoring MSWM on a global scale are still lacking The major challenges suchas waste generation collection transportation and logistics treat ment and disposal remain gaps for further investigation Baawain et al Hietala et al Hassan et al Loan et al Mmereki et al Regional discussion on MSWM in a CE This study shows that Europe has the highest number of pub lications in the eld of MSWM in a CE followed by Asia and Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean In contrast Africa and North America currently have fewer studies indicating that there is still plenty of room for further exploration Africa addresses wideranging and multifaceted MSWM prob lems Municipal solid waste is normally disposed of without any consideration of its ecological and human health effects Dumpsites are basically uncontrolled or poorly managed However current waste treatment technologies are incapable of being applied in this region due to their high cost Hietala et al Most African cities are now facing challenges from poor public service management due to insuf cient and failing infrastructure caused by underinvestment Furthermore even adequate MSWM infrastructure cannot cope withthe excess waste leading to excessive leakage of plastic waste into the natural environment including through some onsite plastic waste locations especially along the coastlines Das et al This situation has contributed to common unsanitary events such as poor solid waste and wastewater disposal resulting in heavy pollution of heavy metals persistent organic contaminants and biological ef u ence in water resources North America has fewer articles even though the region is composed of rich and developed countries The region s approach to SWM has evolved over time from open discarding to integrated waste management moving in the direction of a proactive approach Hettiaratchi In North America effective waste reduction is largely driven by policies and legislation combined with suitable technologies and economic procedures Hence the status quo is not necessarily improved High living standards and income per capita are connected to high rejection rates resulting in very large amounts of waste Mmereki et al Indeed cities have stopped recycling municipal waste due to its high cost and the low pro ts from recy cling activities The region sends its waste to other regions and often achieves extremely poor waste management performance Barnes The result is an important crisis that requires reconsidering the policy of exporting waste over long distances to develop real solutions under the situation of escalating global consumption Dauvergne Under such circumstances dif cult challenges still endure Elements of ecological superiority municipal wellbeing and consciousness resource crises and alternative energy in sus tainable waste systems should receive more attention Overall the concept of MSWM in a CE has received extensive attention over the last decade and has become a principal point for progressing towards achieving regional sustainable development Nainggolan et al UNIDO As a result the uncertainties and complexities are growing deeper and faster than the extent to which decision makers are capable of responding The improve ments are inadequate in the face of such escalating challenges and a lack of quality assessments is causing a large number of problemsthat need to be solved to exploit the potential of MSWM in a CE Concluding remarks This study presents a review of a bibliometric analysis of MSWM in a CE identi es indicators for improvement and provides a regional stateoftheart comparison This study proposes a hybrid approach to enhance traditional bibliometric analysis The pro posed hybrid method includes bibliometric analysis the fuzzyFM Tsai TD Bui ML Tseng et al Journal of Cleaner Production Delphi method and the entropy weight method VOSviewer soft ware is used in the bibliometric analysis to visualize an overview of the bibliometric status by applying data obtained from the Scopus database and presenting the results as visual information The fuzzy Delphi method aims to screen out unnecessary indicators based on expert judgments The entropy weight method trans forms the indicator frequencies into comparable weights to deter mine the performance of different regions on the indicators and to identify the critical indicators This study contributes to the litera ture as follows A datadriven systematic review is presented Bibliographic coupling analysis identi es keywords and indicators are accepted as critical concerns based on expert evaluation The following top ve indicators are chosen incineration LCA plastic waste sorting waste and sustainability are potential avenues for further investigation and offer the opportunity to identify priorities for speculation A total of countriesterritories are included which are then rearranged into regions Asia and Oceania Europe North America Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean The results show that Europe has the highest number of publications in the eld of MSWM in a CE followed by Asia and Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean In contrast Africa and North America have fewer publications than the other regions The challenges and gaps among different geographical regions not only contribute local viewpoints for investigation but also offer the global state of the art of MSWM in a CE Hence this study can serve as a reference for the decision making of MSWM and CE actors The government and professionals can nd useful information for policy design and practical planning from different regional perspectives to promote innovation Africa and North America are con rmed to have fewer publications In particular Africa is in urgent need of improvement since current waste treatment technologies cannot be applied in this region due to their high cost This study provides overall insights into the complex study background and intensively broadens the scope of MSWM in a CE Future studies need to align quality incentives for solid waste processing to CE practices as well as a focus linked to production and consumption perspectives and develop the gaps in MSWM in a CE to improve the roles of rms governments and professionals in fostering innovative implementations Future studies should examine incineration intensi cation as a sustainable instrument for assessing sustainable development practices LCA approachesshould be amended to integrate conceptual CE aspects for the sustainable management of solid waste Future studies corre spondingly need to focus on and deploy SWM methods including relevant differences regarding CE consumption behaviors to meet daily life requirements Plastic waste issues should be better emphasized in future research as a precedence to frame a clearer link between a CE and sustainability due to largescale environ mental disputes and Elaboration of MSWM and CE effects in terms of sustainability such as a reduction in carbon emissions or the curbing of waste and pollution should be given further consideration Nevertheless this study entails certain limitations Although Scopus has a broad scope with regard to indexing publications there are some limitations in regard to the inclusion of lowimpact sources and updating the latest articles Shukla et al This discussion may not be detailed enough to perform a quality assessment and future research should employ more condensed data for better results This study provides an indepth technique for datadriven analysis and future research should examine both academic and practical investigations in this eld CRediT authorship contribution statement Feng Ming Tsai Writing review editing TatDat Bui Writing original draft Writing review editing nal check MingLang
