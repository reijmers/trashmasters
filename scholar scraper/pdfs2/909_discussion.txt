3.1. MCI Calculation
Results from the MCI calculations for various product types are presented in Table 2 .
A graphical comparison of the calculated MCI for PET, PE, PP , ﬁlm, and mix washed and
milled products produced from MSW and separate waste collection is presented in Figure 5 .
For MSW washed and milled goods, the highest calculated MCI was for PE goods with
a MCI of 0.84, followed by PP , PET, ﬁlm and mixed goods with MCIs of 0.8, 0.78, 0.71,
and 0.62, respectively. On the other hand, for separately collected washed and milled
goods, the highest calculated MCI was for PP washed and milled goods with a calculated
MCI of 0.86, followed by PET, PE, mix, and ﬁlm goods with MCIs of 0.82, 0.81, 0.8, and
0.78, respectively.
