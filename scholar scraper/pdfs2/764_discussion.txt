4.1. LCA matrix model and waste pre-treatment
In the LCA matrix model, four main polymer categories were
identiﬁed. The ﬁrst are the complex plastics (engineering and high
performance plastics) that have lowest environmental impactthrough primary recycling (dissolution or closed-loop mechanical
recycling). Due to the high environmental impacts of the produc-
tion phase, recycled quantities and quality of the output increases
the environmental performance of the primary recycling technol-
ogy signiﬁcantly. However, there are strict boundary conditions
for treating the input waste stream with primary recycling tech-
nologies. For this the products from the waste streams have to
be either pure or well sorted monostream equivalents. In the case
studies, the sorting efﬁciency negatively affected the recycling
treatment in various manners, including exclusion of speciﬁc recy-
cling treatments (closed loop mechanical recycling) or decreasing
