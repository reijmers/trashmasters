This section provides a discussion of future study challenges and
implications for the status of different regions.
5.1. Future challenges and directions
This subsection discusses challenges and future study gaps
based on the top ﬁve indicators, which were determined to be
incineration, LCA, plastic waste, sorting solid waste, and
sustainability.
5.1.1. Incineration
Municipal solid waste is disposed of either by land ﬁlling or
through incineration. In fact, waste incineration has recently
become a fascinating treatment method. Continuous increases in
waste generation, the absence of funding for land ﬁlls and their
environmental and public health impacts have prompted anincreased interest in incineration ( Sebastian et al., 2019 ). Inciner-
ation is a process of burning municipal solid waste to sterile ash
with little environmental impact. In optimal energy recovery and
ecological sustainability, incineration decreases the amount of
waste by 90% and the volume of mass by 70%; it also provides a
possibility of recovering energy in the form of electricity ( Joseph
et al., 2018 ;Sebastian et al., 2018 ).Ashraf et al. (2019) proposed a
clean closed-loop incineration procedure that utilizes municipal
solid waste residues and helps reduce expensive land ﬁll taxes. The
feasibility of municipal solid waste incineration is determined by
the composition of the municipal solid waste, which is the most
crucial criterion; in contrast, the sustainable MSWM selections that
are made pose a threat to the environment ( Al-Salem et al., 2014 ).
Although incineration is supposed to be a pathway to sustainable
MSWM, it may not always be a feasible discarding technique, as it
largely depends on the waste characteristics, which are dependent
on the indigenous demography, sociocultural differences, seasonal
changeability and landscape ( Rajaeifar et al., 2017 ). Incineration is a
multifaceted, complicated process with trade-offs among
numerous dimensions with a cost-intensive requirement for an
extensive practicability assessment of implementation.
In practice, the possibility of using incineration outputs such as
ash, carbon dioxide, and energy to make cementing material
through novel production stages allows a reproduction process
within incinerator facilities ( Ghouleh and Shao, 2018 ). Eco-cement
production is based exclusively on municipal solid waste inciner-
ation residues to maximize the recycling potential. A simulation of
solid waste incineration on an advanced technology-driven pack-
aging bed with corrected boundary circumstances, homogeneous
responses and control methods for pyrolysis products has been
introduced ( Gu et al., 2019 ). Knowledge of changes in the amount of
feed waste and waste characteristics is a tool to determine the
economic and environmental feasibility of incineration technology
(Milbrandt et al., 2018 ). However, this process remains unpopularTable 3
