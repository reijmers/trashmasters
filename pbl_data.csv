Integral Circular Economy Report 2023 Assessment for the Netherlands,18-04-2023,"Every two years, the Integral Circular Economy Report (ICER) provides an overview of the status of the desired transition towards a circular economy in the Netherlands. PBL is producing this report at the request of the Dutch Government and in cooperation with other Dutch knowledge institutions.","The Dutch Government intends to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050 and to halve the use of primary abiotic raw materials by 2030. It sees monitoring as an important way of tracking the progress of the transition. This report is intended as a knowledge base for the societal and political debate on the transition towards a circular economy. It covers both physical trends in Dutch resource use, its effects on the environment and security of supply, as well as the activities undertaken by companies, citizens and government authorities to accelerate the transition. Beside the current situation around the transition towards a circular economy in the Netherlands, the report also offers tools to accelerate that transition.
The transition aims at using material resources more efficiently and in radically smaller amounts. A focus on more circular use of material resources, materials and products can reduce the negative environmental impacts, such as climate change, environmental pollution and biodiversity loss as well as the supply risks (see Figure 1).

	Dutch material resource use and its impacts
The ICER 2023 provides information on the international and Dutch trends in material resource use and their associated impacts. This includes a focus on the input of material resources in the Netherlands, product use phase, and, once products leave the chain, on the losses in the form of waste.
This report shows amongst other things that the material resource use — in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the production chain — has decreased between 2018 and 2020. This was mainly due to the lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a decrease in commuter and air travel and, therefore, to a decrease in the use of fossil energy carriers. This decrease, however, is not a structural phenomenon, and no clear decrease can be seen for the use of minerals and metals.

	Transition process towards a circular economy
To track the progress of the transition process, we look at the activities various stakeholders in society are undertaking to make their production and consumption processes more circular as well as the resources they are deploying to do so. The framework in Figure 2 shows the eight key processes underlying the analysis.
So far, there is no noticeable acceleration in the transition to a circular economy in the Netherlands. Circular companies still make up no more than about 6% of the total number of Dutch companies, and financial support for circular activities has been constant for years, with about 10% of total support from the schemes surveyed. Many circular initiatives are still in an early phase, without many scale up or breakthrough activities. As yet, substantial market demand for and supply of circular products and services is lacking.
This publication contains the main findings and summary of the Integral Circular Economy Report 2023. The full Dutch report with results in more detail and further substantiation of the main findings can be found on the PBL site (see link to the right).

Plastic futures and their CO2 emissions,07-12-2022,"A circular bioeconomy can dramatically rein in the fast-growing plastic sector’s climate, pollution, and resource consumption impacts. Under current policies, global plastic production will likely triple by the year 2100. Today, the plastic sector is responsible for almost 5% of all greenhouse gas emissions. By providing a circular, bio-based plastic industry with emissions-free electricity, and by avoiding waste incineration, the sector may even grow to become a form of carbon sink.
	That is the conclusion of an article in the journal Nature, published recently by researchers from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), Utrecht University, the Netherlands Association for Sustainable Energy (NVDE) and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).",
Addressing international impacts of the Dutch circular economy transition,09-05-2022,"The Netherlands has the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. This policy brief discusses the risks and opportunities of the Dutch circular economy transition for low- and middle-income countries that are connected to the Dutch economy through international supply chains. The conclusions are relevant not only for Dutch circular economy policy, but also for development cooperation in which achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is central.","The policy brief is written at the request of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It puts the circular economy transition in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby taking a broader perspective than the Dutch Government’s focus on environmental impact and security of supply. The analysis builds on the main insights from two case studies published in 2021 that focused on electronics and textiles, trade data and environmental footprint analyses from the Integral Circular Economy Report (ICER 2021), as well as on an assessment of various stakeholder perspectives on the role of low- and middle-income countries in the circular economy of the Netherlands and European Union.

	Risks for low- and middle-income countries determined by both local and Dutch policies
Whether the Dutch circular economy transition presents mostly opportunities or mainly risks for low- and middle-income countries is determined not only by the policies and practices in these countries themselves, but also by Dutch circular economy policies. Possible risks include increased pressure on food systems and nature due to increased use of biomass, and loss of employment in the extraction of raw materials and in the manufacturing industry as a result of declining demand for goods and stricter product standards. In addition, there is a risk that adverse effects of the current linear economy, such as poor working conditions and pollution during the processing of discarded items, will be repeated in the circular economy.

	Safeguards and coherence in policy are required 
The policy brief concludes that mitigating risks and capitalising on the opportunities for low- and middle-income countries requires safeguards and enhanced coherence between circular economy policies, trade policies and development cooperation. Specific policy actions include investing in knowledge and data on trade and impacts, integrating the circular economy in existing policies and programmes, and involving low- and middle-income countries in designing and implementing circular economy policies."
Circular Economy Progress Report 2022,14-04-2022,"This Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 provides an update of the progress and transition towards a circular economy. It builds on the conclusions published by PBL in January 2021 in the Integral Circular Economy Report (ICER 2021). A number of indicators from the ICER monitoring framework have been updated, for this purpose. In addition, this progress report looks more closely at the possible role of the circular economy in tackling the various challenges within the human environment.","Update of certain indicators
PBL will publish a limited progress report in the years in-between ICER reports. This year, the progress report provides an update for a number of indicators. The update shows no changes in the relative magnitude of circular corporate activities, in terms of value added and employment, and this is also the case for the share in tax and subsidy schemes directed to circular initiatives. Most projects subsidised under these schemes concern recycling. The actions in the Circular Economy Implementation Programme 2019–2023 do show a slight shift towards higher level circularity strategies, such as rethink and reuse. This update has not led to many changes in the conclusions drawn in the ICER 2021, with respect to the progress made towards a circular economy in the Netherlands.

	Societal issues and the role of the circular economy
Producing and consuming in a more circular way can make a relevant contribution to addressing various societal challenges, such as combating climate change, reducing pollution, halting biodiversity loss and limiting the risks to security of supply. Emissions to the environment and the use of natural resources, such as land and water, can be minimised by making radically more efficient use of natural resources, materials and products throughout production and consumption chains — from extraction to disposal. This progress report shows that, depending on the goal to be achieved, certain natural resources and materials are more relevant than others."
Possible objectives for a circular economy,17-12-2021,"At the request of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, PBL identifies possible objectives for a circular economy. Changes in the way raw materials are used may contribute substantially to solving various major social issues, such as the impact of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution of air, water and soil, and supply risks related to raw materials.","This is the English version of the summary of the Dutch policy brief 'Mogelijke doelen voor een Circulaire Economie'. The study analyses which raw material flows and product groups are most relevant, in this respect. The policy brief outlines the next steps towards a framework for setting more concrete targets for a circular economy.
The study was conducted in cooperation with Statistics Netherlands (CBS), the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and Rijkswaterstaat (RWS, the government service for roads and waterways) and is intended to support a process to work out the details of the general objectives of a circular economy for 2030 and 2050, carried out by the ministry in consultation with stakeholders."
Potential effects of Dutch circular economy strategies on low- and middle-income countries: Cotton production and post-consumer textiles,18-11-2021,"The Netherlands has the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. At the request of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we explore what such a transition could mean for low- and middle-income countries that are connected to the Netherlands through international value chains. In this report, we focus on textiles. More specifically, we examine cotton production in West Africa and post-consumer textiles processing in Pakistan.","Trade data was used to visualise trade in cotton, garments and post-consumer textiles to and from the Netherlands. Literature review and expert interviews were used to qualitatively assess socio-economic and environmental impacts in low- and middle-income countries. The study is part of a broader project that analyses transboundary effects of the circular economy transition in the Netherlands.

	Current impacts
In 2018, more than 50% of Dutch clothing was made from cotton, with Bangladesh being the largest supplier. Cotton is an important cash crop for West African farmers, providing a source of income for many smallholders. Export from the top-5 cotton producing countries in West Africa account for around 40% of Bangladeshi imports of cotton. Nonetheless, local value addition in West Africa is negligible and cotton production is linked to a range of sustainability issues, including land degradation, pollution, and health and safety risks. In 2018, more than 50% of Dutch post-consumer textiles was incinerated, while around 60% of total collected volumes (both domestically and imported) was exported for reuse and recycling abroad. Pakistan is an important destination for post-consumer textiles, where they are sorted, graded, and resold or recycled. Still, little specific information is available on post-consumer textiles processing in Pakistan and related impacts.

	Effects of a circular economy transition
The Dutch circular economy transition is likely to affect the amount and composition of new clothing imported, as well as of post-consumer textiles exported. The effects on low- and middle-income countries depend on 1) the type of circular economy strategies implemented; 2) whether or not and, if so, how low- and middle-income countries will become part of the Dutch circular economy; for instance, by implementing specific sustainability standards or using Dutch discarded textiles in new clothing; and 3) the local conditions of the countries in question. To avoid negative impacts in cotton production, policies with minimum requirements or exclusions in production standards need to take in account challenges and opportunities within the local context. For post-consumer textiles, it is important to implement labour rights standards and monitoring and reporting policies throughout the value chain.

	Preconditions for a just transition
With the right preconditions, the circular economy transition can contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This requires monitoring beyond environmental impacts, understanding global networks of trade in discarded garments for reuse, recycling or refurbishment, alignment of circularity targets with impact targets abroad, coordinated efforts across the various stages in the global supply chain, and inclusion of stakeholders from the Global South in policy discussions."
Extended Producer Responsibility,09-07-2021,"Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a widely used policy to support the transition to a circular economy in the European Union. In these two reports, PBL and CPB analyse the design, functioning and effects of EPR, based on a survey of the literature and on case studies on batteries, end-of-life vehicles and medicines in the Netherlands.","Effects of EPR are determined by its design
EPR employs various policy instruments to make producers — financially, and sometimes also organisationally — responsible for the collection, sorting and treatment of end-of-life products. The reports focus on two key elements of EPR design: the mix of EPR instruments used, and whether producers fulfil their obligations individually or collectively. The most common EPR instruments are take-back requirements, advance disposal and recycling fees, and deposit-refund systems.
Existing EPR designs have generally increased collection rates, promoted recycling and shifted financial responsibility from municipalities to producers. While knowledge gaps exist, there is likely ample room to steer EPR design towards promoting reuse, high-quality recycling and eco-design.

	Wider use of deposit-refund systems and differentiated fees can help
Deposit-refund systems are well-positioned to promote reuse and improve the quality of recycled material. Differentiated (modulated) fees can also encourage improvements in the quality of secondary material and stimulate eco-design. Coupling these instruments with incentives to increase demand for used products by consumers and demand for recycled material by producers can increase their effectiveness.

	Scope of EPR is key for its environmental effectiveness
In practice, producers’ financial responsibility is limited to separately collected product streams. A wider policy implication of our studies is to expand the scope of EPR to end-of-life products that are not separately collected. This applies to both products that are improperly disposed of in the EU, but also used products exported to third countries where EPR is not implemented. Introducing EPR to other products groups, including medicines and motor vehicles beyond cars and vans, is likely to prevent environmental damages from littering and illegal dumping, and to direct more material flows towards reuse and recycling.

	EPR is no panacea
The circular economy aspires to more than what EPR can deliver on its own. Just as its effects depend on other (waste) policies, EPR will always require accompanying policies — mostly targeted at the production and consumption phases of a product’s lifecycle — to facilitate the transition to a circular economy."
Potential effects of Dutch circular economy strategies on low- and middle-income countries: the case of electrical and electronic equipment,19-02-2021,"The Netherlands has the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. In this report, we analyse what such a transition could mean for low- and middle-income countries that are connected to the Netherlands through international value chains, focusing on transboundary trade in discarded electrical and electronic equipment. We identify conditions for positive impact and discuss opportunities, risks and dilemmas. This study is part of a broader project that analyses transboundary effects of the circular economy transition in the Netherlands.","Current impacts of transboundary trade
Around one fifth of discarded electronics - second-hand electrical and electronic equipment and e-waste - in the Netherlands is exported, around one quarter of which illegally. For receiving countries, the main drivers are socioeconomic benefits such as consumer demand for affordable, high quality products and the ability to earn a living from trading and processing electronics. At the same time, as a result of unsafe processing in those countries, this also results in environmental pollution, public health risks and material losses.

	Effects of a circular economy transition
The Dutch transition towards a circular economy is likely to affect the amount and composition of the discarded electronics that is exported to low- and middle-income countries. The effects for the receiving countries could be both positive and negative, depending on 1) the type of circular economy strategy in the Netherlands; 2) whether or not and, if so, how low- and middle-income countries will become part become of the Dutch circular economy; for instance, due to lifetime extension, refurbishment and e-waste processing in those countries; and 3) the way e-waste is processed there. Negative effects may be limited through investments in safe and environmentally sound e-waste management in the receiving countries; robust registration, reporting and monitoring systems for exports of discarded electronics; and effective enforcement of existing international regulations as well as greater restrictions on the export of worthless and hazardous parts.

	A just transition requires an inclusive approach
Circular economy strategies that fail to address the interlinkages between human development, pollution and resource efficiency, will at best miss an opportunity for an inclusive transition, and at worst undermine the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Instead of trying to replace informal jobs on which many people in receiving countries depend, the local waste collectors, dismantlers and recyclers can be supported and encouraged to adopt safer techniques and to gain access to better equipment. Transforming the existing informal networks of e-waste management is key, while putting mechanisms in place that ensure the livelihoods of workers are not negatively affected."
International Workshop on Targets for a Circular Economy - summary,24-02-2020,"In preparation for The Annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in January 2020, PBL Netherlands and Utrecht University, in consultation with PACE, organized an international workshop on targets for a circular economy on the 17th of January 2020.","The workshop was attended by more than 30 leading actors from public, private and civil society in Europe. The goal of the workshop was to discuss key dimensions for circular economy targets that go beyond the input of resources and generation of waste. Furthermore, the need for coordination, harmonization and alignment was identified, and a basis was set for further collaboration among the participants with next steps. The  recommendations were discussed with Stientje van Veldhoven (Dutch Minister of Housing and Environment) and used as an input to shape the discussion on circular economy metrics at the WEF."
Outline of the circular economy,29-05-2019,"In many countries, governments are looking for ways to change their economy into one that is circular, or to improve the level of resource efficiency (e.g. see the EU programme ‘Closing the loop’ or the World Circular Economy Forum). To do so effectively, having an overview of the current state of circular activities in the economy is important. To date, such an overview has been lacking. This PBL report provides an outline of the current state of the circular economy in the Netherlands.",
