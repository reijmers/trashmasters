reviewed and clarified in particular the terms food surplus waste and losses this work highlights why the clarity of these definitions is crucial for the sustainability of future food waste management systems especially in the context of circular economy through a simple matrix definition s are linked to the concept s of edibility and possi bility of avoidance leading to six distinct categories of food waste i edible ii naturally inedible pits iii industria l residue iv inedible due to natural causes pests v inedible due to ineffective management and vi not accounted for category i encompasses surplus food only category ii v food waste and c ategory vi food losses based on this an updated pyramid for food waste hierarchy is proposed distinguish ing surplus food and a new category for material recycling in order to reflect the future food waste biorefineries in the circular bioeconomy nutrient and energy recovery are two separate categorie s and the terms recovery and recycling are clarified finally a circular economy framework is presented for food surplus and waste considering closing the loop throughout the whole food supply chain in connection with the concept of strong and

food waste in australia in parallel t he growing need for energy and materials to supply the demands of a fast growing and res ource intensive p opulation is forcing a shift from a linear to a circular economy circular economy treats waste as a secondary resource ellen macarthur foundation the eu has implemented an action plan for the circular economy which includes also a commitment to meet the global sustainable development goal sdg to halve per capita food waste at the retail and consumer level and reducing food losses along production and supply chains includin g post harvest losses by flanagan et al circular economy is redefining the framework conditio ns for the waste management of food waste and for other types of waste creating new business opportunities food waste can be used to produce various biomaterials mirabella et al bioenergy dahiya et al as well as high value products strati and oreopoulou teigiserova et al yet being at the inflection point between the linear and circular paradigms it is important to ensure that any new management model for food prevention and food wast e usage will be sustainable ie stay within planetary boundary guardrails rockstrm et al steffen et al adopting the concept of strong sustainability for european bioeconomy instead of weak sustainability can be a crucial step in this endeavor however there are several challenges towards food waste prevention and towards a sustai nable food waste management system within the emerging circular bioeconomy the journal preproofjournal preproof first one considers the variable definitions of food waste and therefore the possibility of developing coherent regulatory metrics for quantification accounting actual glob al losses are an estimate parfitt et al the existing data include high uncertainty corrado et al and different scopes for measurement s making extrapolation and comparison of data very challenging the second challenge lies in a failure to distinguish food waste into appropriate categories that could be linked with a corresponding waste hierarchy the current waste hierarchy is not properly distinguishing terminology in accordance with sustainable management the terms used in the hierarchy do not have a clear scope and are often used as synonyms such as food loss and food surplus recycling and reuse recycling and recovery unep bernstad saraiva schott et al a food waste hierarchy distinguishing food surplus and waste but not clear endoflife eol pathways was proposed by papargyropoulou et al while garcia garcia et al expanded eol the most but with no distinctions of surplus waste and loss and us epa classified industrial use in their hierarchy dou et al although there is an agreement on the prevention and avoidance of disposal there is a continuing discussion and confusion in other eol treatments there is a need for clarification and harmonization combining feedstock specifics surplus food and food waste as a secondary resource and its eol treatments as waste hierarchy is used in policies this lack of clarity can result in regulation s that are not aligned such as european marketing standards that lead to wastage of nutritious food that could have been prevented priefer et al in light of these issues the goals of this article are as follows summarize current food waste terminology and definiti ons and propose a clear cutting categorization for the various types of food waste losses and surpluses journal preproofjournal preproof update the food waste hierarchy and link it to the categories of food waste developed in introspect current policies and framework affecting food surplus and waste circular economy efforts in the european union and their relation to strong and weak sustainability propose a framework for food waste management in a circular economy in the context of strong sustainability complementing the existi ng one for non organic waste definitions food waste according to regulation and science community as many times pointed out the definitions of food waste differ significantly in the literature and require harmonization in order to accomplish effici ent quantification to assess the wastage of food hamilton et al thyberg and tonjes xue et al hartikainen et al ec the difference in the definitions result s in a wide range of food waste estimates bellemare et al with limited comparability and usefulness in relation to measuring the distance to sdg several initiatives attempted to harmonize methodologies and definitions for fw such as the fusio ns quantification manual tostivint et al the refresh project wunder et al flw flw through its flw quantification ranking tool and champions which inc ludes monitoring indicators to achieve sdg flanagan et al in europe definitions from european policies are considered vague and left to interpretation by the member states in order to adapt them for national circumstances and priorities hcwh europe ec a to illustrate this lack of harmonization a key eu directive namely the waste framework directive wfd ec does not journal preproofjournal preproof differentiate fw from other types of organic waste such as garden waste european parliament a recent study by the international food policy research institute ifpri highlights the urgency for common definitions throughout the whole food supply chain fsc including preharvest losses ifpri among others the distinction between agricultural waste and food waste needs to be clearer as to how exactly these wastes differ and in this respect how to refine definitions to eliminate their overlap as stated in the widely used definition of the landmark eufunded project fusions pre harvest waste including not mature crops and dead animals does not coun t as food waste meaning that all preharvest waste is quantified as agricultural waste stergren et al yet animals and fish can be consumed before they reach maturity for the market they are intended hartikainen et al argue that these should be counted as food waste as they can be slaughtered at any stage of maturity and used for food ie introduced in the fsc the study also argues that the inedible part should not be included in the food waste definition one rationale for this is that only edible parts of food can be considered for prevention and redistribution to malnourished however there is no universal standard of what is edible and w hat is not distinguishing inedibility and edibility is rather subjective and differs not only from country to country but also by consumers preference for example dishes prepared from chicken feet are consumed in asian regions while in european countr ies it is generally considered inedible within the same region kiwi peels may be eaten by some individuals while being consider ed inedible by others the common terminology should support both social and environmental goals distinguishing edible which is meant for prevention and redistribution to malnourished and inedible for further eol valorization such as animal feed or bio based product s journal preproofjournal preproof clarifying terminology a variety of terms have been used to describe waste in connection to food in particular the terms food loss food waste and surplus food the most common definition of these three main terms and their connection to the fsc are represented in table here five stages of the fsc are distinguished agricultural production postharvest activities processing and manufacturing retail and wholesale consumption and services agricultural production consist s of pre harvest primary production which is usually excluded from food waste as only postharvest activities are include d food loss often refer s to the postharvest and processing stage fao thyberg and tonjes but sometimes include s food loss at any stage of the fsc that is still suitable for human consumption albeit unmarketable for aesthetic reasons kantor et al it can refer to an unintentional loss in quality or quantity however the term food waste a nd loss is often used as one category therefore leading to o verlap ping fao girotto et al the definition of food loss has major implications as the term is used in polici es notably the eu common agricultural policy cap argues that only food loss and not fw is generated during primary production european court of auditors this implies that any food items wasted at the pre harvest agricultural stage would be part of food loss with no fw reported while food waste and losses would be reported at the other stages surplus food represent s the leftover edible food fit for human consumption it can often refer to the retail and consumption stage s of the fsc garrone et al but also to overproduction at the agricultural eg primary production stage papargyropoulou et al parts of the surplus food and food loss become food waste either due to naturally inedible parts or to un consumed parts that degrade papargyropoulou et al journal preproofjournal preproof institutions and scientific communit ies use the term s food surplus loss and waste presented in table to form boundaries and scope for research methodologies and accounting as presented in table different boundaries for the terms and definitions of food waste lead to results that are very challenging to compare or use to feed action plans or specific interventions from this point onwards the acronym fswl will be used to represent the overall food surplus losses and waste for which the single t erm food waste is often used here this work propose s that surplus food only encompass es the nutritional surp lus of food fit for human consumption to reflect that people are inclined to eat leftovers but less likely to eat what is considered waste even though surplus food is ori ginating primarily after the agricultur al stage there are cases when food can be consumed prior to post harvest activities such as consumption of not mature animal mentioned by hartikainen et al food waste is the n food that cannot be expected to be eaten by humans due to either natural inedibility or inedibility due to the management of food throughout whole fsc as proposed in ifpri and bellemare et al in this context and in the perspective of complete material flow assessments food loss should only refer to the streams that are truly lost ie inexplicable whether because not accounted for or disappearing from the accounting examples include the discrepancies of the fw stream when transporting food items reported outputs no t matching the initial inputs insert table and here clarifying and updating hierarchy for food surplus waste and loss expanding the levels of the waste hierarchy the waste hierarchy is built upon strategies introduced in the s by the european parliaments directive on waste european parliament council and the european journal preproofjournal preproof commission s second environment action program european commission later refined into the waste hierarchy in the eus legislation european parliament council the waste hierarchy provides a guide to choose the most environmentally efficient eol treatment european parliament counci l since the hierarchy is a very general way for prioritization of eol treatment actors and institutions can interpret its meaning in different ways to achieve their goals which is mainly a consequence of the unspecific terms used in the hierar chy for instance feeding to animals can belong to the reuse and recycling category and biobased products can belong to both recycling and recovery unep bernstad saraiva schott et al moreover eurostat states the only reasonable treatment of b iowaste is comp osting or anaerobic digestion eu open data portal this assumption points towards a lack of databases for sharing waste information and technologies adopting a separated waste hierarchy for f swl is perceived as promising to increase the efficiency of prevention and reuse european of court auditors wunder et al but has not been adopted by the new waste framework directive official journal of the european union as for the waste hierarchy prevention is found on top of the fswl pyramid this means that the greatest efforts are to be placed on keeping edible food edible prevention can be achieved via various pathways at the source either through better logistics and management tools production processing and retail level or targeting consumers education behavior and consumption habits consumer level papargyropo ulou et al garrone et al in particular these efforts are to be targeted first and foremost on the most resource intensive and polluting food items in particular red meat and dairy products hedenus et al stollkleemann and oriordan searchinger et al in other words it weight s more to prevent eg beef to reach the fswl management chain than preventing eg vegetables to reach the fswl journal preproofjournal preproof the second level represents reuse for human consumption surplus food is the only fraction that can be directly reuse d for human consumption and is often part of the prevention strategies or studies mourad garrone et al due to foods highly degradable nature reuse of surplus food is tied to strict safety and hygiene norms which can limit the quantity of reused food and by consequence increase fw priefer et al as the animal feed sector has its own food safety rules it is a distinct re use category coming after re use for humans for obvious ethical reasons in this perspective the vi sion is that surplus food is re used exclusively for humans while food waste may be re used by animals and never by humans the safety precautions for reusing food waste for animal feed needs to ensure prevention of incidents such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse and foot and mouth disease fmd tomley and shirley henningsson et al the european commission has recently p ublished the guidelines for fw to animal feed ec b with a restriction on the reuse of the meat waste and its residues if this fraction would be heattreated it could be used for feed ing omnivorous non ruminants wunder et al increasing considera bly the amount of animal feed available heat treatment can be expensive and if not incentivi zed the application of other cheaper technologies will be prioritized by the industry such as incentivized biomass to energy wunder et al the latter is often a consequence of targets to reach high shares of overall renewable energy in europe by and by european council moving down the hierarchy recovery and recycling are often used interchangeably even though they are two separate categories for example anaerobic digestion ad is sometimes included in recovery as energy recovery in braguglia et al and other times in recycling unep as ad involves not only biogas but also digestate production it is considered by the eu waste legislation as a recycling valorization ec a re journal preproofjournal preproof distribution of food is sometimes referred to as recovery garrone et al while fw used as animal feed can be counted as recycling mourad therefore nutrient and energy recovery are to be in two separate categories for the reason that these are two distinct services with foreseen differentiated importance in the future especially in the context of safe operatin g space where biogeochemical flow boundary of nitrogen cycle has been already surpassed rockstrm et al and the concerns about the depletion of phosphate ro ck van vuuren et al the specific case is anaerobic digestion ad of food waste which provides both fertilizer as degassed biomass eg digestate and en ergy as methane or storable hydr ocarbon and therefore can fit either of the categories here the intended service of ad energy or nutrient ie the one that justifies why ad takes place should be the one determining to which categor y ad belong s for the case considered as the digestate represent s a large portion of the material output about of incoming biomass pehme et al hamelin et al it is considered primarily as nutrient recovery if applied as fertilizer if fertilizer is not applied due to various reason such as local regulation th en ad belong s to energy recovery further food waste is regarded as a secondary material resource for the economy just as plastic glass or metal scraps t his means that eg recycling refers to material recycling that does not involve complete degradation as is the case of energy and nutrient recovery in doing so recycling then targets products that can be re introduced into the economy taking into acc ount economic value such as market price including the economic value into the hierarchy has been urged by a number of economists rasmussen et al papargyropoulou et al thus recycling consider s higher value products such as biobased chemicals and product s that range around usdkg teigiserova et al but excludes fertilizer compost and other land application valorization with low er economic value andor market size in a nutshell surplus food is prevented first followed by reuse for human consumption reuse h journal preproofjournal preproof while food waste is considered for reuse for animal feed reuse a to be prioritized over the material recycling followed by the nutrient recovery and finally used for the energy recovery with the disposal avoided these suggestions are represented as a revised food waste and surplus pyramid in figure insert figu re here categorization of food surplus waste and losses depending on the ambient conditions and foods nature some part s of the food are bound to become a waste however there is a difference between natural inedibility of food such as bones and pits and inedibility as a consequence of food degradation such as rotten food both cannot be expected to be eaten by humans but while the first one cannot be avoided the second one can be avoided to some extent making it partly avoidable table provided a clarified overview of the terminology used for fswl its use in earlier studies in table using these definitions further a matrix is developed table connecting fswl to the conce pts of edibility and avoidance this allows categorizing of fswl according to six useful and distinct categories category i encompasses all edible food that is fit for human consumption hence the surplus food category ii cannot be avoided due to foods natural inedibility category iii on the other hand can be minimized by process optimization though it also cannot be avoided fully categories iv and v cover cases where inedibility cannot be avoided completely due to foods high perishability category v or due to unpredicted conditions damages by we ather or pests category iv especially when transporting or dealing with large quantities some of the food is bound to be damaged such waste can include mold formation due to inappropriate storage defects from handling etc further category v is differentiating the situations where the lack of resource s poor functioning of the fsc prevent s efficient management to those where inefficient management is due to negligence the former are the situation s where the actors cannot easily make a direct chang e due to the unavailability of appropriate infrastructure cold journal preproofjournal preproof storage institutional and legal frameworks etc mostly but no t exclusively associated with monetary resources the latter situation represents cases where actors have all the reso urces to implement changes but edible food has been spoiled damaged or left uneaten after preparation finally t he last category vi belongs to previously discussed loss or amounts not accounted for insert table here surplus food can be decreased on each level of the fsc dahiya et al and thus prevented figure while food was te cannot at the consumer stage partly avoidable food waste can be defined on the basis of consumer habits such as bread crumbs or potato peels that are naturally edible and therefore it is considered as surplus food on the retail stage of the fsc surplus food is often not re distributed in time due to transportation and distribution costs despite the best prevention efforts in fact most food items need to be reuse d immediately but the distribution usually waits until the quantity of food is high enough to cover the costsgenerate a profit buzby et al therefore when prevention fails surplus food category i becomes food waste category v the inedible fraction of food categories ii v represents a big potential for material recycling which can be seen from the increased interest from the scientific community on industrial use of food waste as a secondary resource input for biorefineries mirabella et al galanakis material recycling is unlikely to happen for consumer mixed waste as these streams are would require heavy processing t o extract higher value products in the perspective of material recycling avoidable and partly avoidable waste is thus interesting due to large quantities of homogeneous waste that can be used as a secondary resource according to the hierarchy presented in figure material recycling should be considered as a preferred treatment for food waste when it cannot be used for animal feed hence developing strategies for recovering streams from unavoidable category ii and iii and partly unavoidable category iv and v food waste could generate economic and environmental journal preproofjournal preproof benefits as these streams are always present for instance in the unforeseen event of a storm or a frost large amounts of category iv waste could be generated which could feed existing mater ial recycling facilities the use of category v waste for material recycling appears less plausible though not to be excluded the moment large quantities are generated in some cases partly avoidable fw may be reduced upon intensifying short value chains kneafsey et al michalopoulos as exemplified in the horizon project decisive decisive ensuring regenerative circular bioeconomy for fswl importance of s trong sustainability for the target goals and decision making reintroducing and re circulating streams through the economy also referr ed to as closing the material resource flow loop is generally perceived as sustainable yet there is a need to differentiate weak and strong sustainability and to anticipate externalities in the future circular economy pizzol et al lopes et al sustainability science and industrial ecology often distinguish between natural human and manufactured capital and a large body of work ha ve studied their interrelations weisz et al in a nutshell manufactured capital represents material goods services or infrastructu re beyond those found directly in nature while natural capital encompasses natural resources and ecosystem services alongside these terms sustainability science also distinguishes between strong and weak sustainability weak sustainability ws sees nat ural and manufacture d capital a s substitutable strong sustainability ss sees them as complementary and highlights the need to conserve critical natural capital pelenc and ballet ang and van passel prevention and environmental impacts are difficult to translate into economic measures as opposed to direct economic saving s therefore regulatory instruments are needed to enforce journal preproofjournal preproof the changes towards strong sustainability to ensure strong sustainable development restoration and conservation of natural resources by staying inside the ecological ceiling o f a safe operating space for humanity mea r ockstrm et al eu decision no eu european parliament one example of such regulatory instruments is the use of taxes and subsidies as proposed by the lancet commission and ipcc specific examples of measures affected by these taxes and subsidies include sustainable cultivation of crops and their inclusion into health y diets subsidies for purchase of suboptimal such as misshaped vegetable food or its sale in separate category in shops for lower prices aschemann witzel et al donations of food for food banks searchinger et al and general prioritization of restorative business models and payment for ecosystem s ervices ipcc kummu et al argued that around of the total use of water cropland and fertilizers are used to produce surplus food ending as food waste which could have been avoided upon adopti ng environmental and social ly responsible business models according to the strong sustain ability principles effective or strongly sustainable application of sdg on surplus food prevent ion would imply a need for policy regulations t hat incentivize the implementation of upcycling technologies ensuring that the exchange s between the technosphe re and the natural environment lead to healthy ecosystems this touches upon sdg that calls fo r a reduction in the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air wa ter and soil pollution and contamination the vision is that the implementation of upcycling technologies needs an integrated plan for eliminating micro pollutants and their recirculation or concentration back to the technosphere conservation of healthy soil ecosystems eg sdg target is needed to avoid externalities on human health connected to the micro pollutants exposure such as heavy metals thomsen et al pizzol et al journal preproofjournal preproof yet to be more than a mere concept ss needs to be measured which in turns requires metrics and indicators the european union plans to develop indicators for measuring resource efficiency in the circular economy including food waste ec a ec b to this end t he conventional use of current eus waste codes ewc by the member states is not sufficient as it does not captures separate categories and classification o f fw and therefore must be expanded and updated to improve fw data in eus member states further support in de cision making was suggested by the co mmission as a way to monitor the progress of circular economy by means of ten indicators divided into four thematic areas production and consumption waste management secondary raw materials and competitiveness and innovation eurostat all four areas can help to a ddress fswl and monitor its use as a secondary resource for instance the thematic area secondary raw materials consist of three indicators that can help integrate fw into ce contribution of recycled materials to raw materials demand circular mate rial use rate trade in recyclable raw material ensuring strong sustainability in eus legislation in the eu until very recently fswl as a policy issue was not explicitly defined and there fore neither properly addressed blakeney european of court auditors the landfill directive is a driver for putting the waste hierarchy forward while the waste framework directive is the cornerstone of the circular economy the largest step in recognizing the food waste issue was the adopti on of a key non legislative act namely the roadmap for a resource efficient europ e in which established that by the disposal of edible food waste should have been halved in the eu ec now expressed in the sdg target for the whole world more recently the circular economy package included legislative proposals on food waste ec a as part of mobilizing the actions for the reduction of fswl and its use as a secondary resource while t he circular journal preproofjournal preproof economy policy package ec aims to close material loops through the r ecycling and reuse of products the bioeconomy strategy ec a is a research and innovation vision aimed at enhancing the exploitation of b iomaterials while restoring natural resources and ecosystem health it has recently been suggested to combine these two strategies into the concept of circular bioeconomy eea a circular bioeconomy would address ecosystem health restoring resource flows biodiversity aspects and nutrient cycles local fsc and biorefineries to diversify income and contribute to the substitution of emission intensive fossil based production systems by biobased chemicals ingredients and products eea the european commission intend s to implement authorization procedures for over a hundred of safe recycling processes including food contact materials to ensure food safety and reduce food waste ec c table provides examples of frameworks and policies that have taken steps towards strong sustainability when it comes to fswl throughout the fsc a more detaile d overview of policies that touch upon fswl has been provided by the eu project refresh wunder et al focusing on sdg insert table here furthermore while many of the currently used quantification s are proxy from the project fusions data from and older there are some quantification estimates from portugal medeiros and swatuk italy availa ble in i talian garrone et al france avai lable in french garot and hungary bori and the estimates using values from eurobarometer european parliament news this highlights the need for more recent quantifications at national level especially in light of the prevention efforts even though the generation of food waste is predicted to rise prevention can be efficient in decreasing food waste as proven by the example of the united kingdom searchinger et al lipinski et al t here are several examples of governmental initia tives in eu to decrease fswl see table italian legislation focuses on food donation throughout the journal preproofjournal preproof whole fsc gonzlez vaqu et al denmark danish veterianry and food administration belgium eesc and france chrisafis concentrate on retail level even though french legislation support s battle against food waste overall with loi n du fevrier relative a la lutte contre le gaspillage alimentaire gonzlez vaqu et al several states such as germany portugal and hungary suppo rt tax deduction on food donation eesc insert table here proposal of circular economy pathways expanding commonly used figure for the circular economy see figure in ellen macarthur foundation which is coherent for materials like electric and electronic waste weee closing the loop for fswl engages all levels of fsc figure represents the summary of possible circular pathways within the fsc it distinguishes inedible and edible fractions for eol options in accord ance with the updated food waste hierarchy figure the pre condition for edible streams to enter the framework of figure is that prevention of becoming food surplus failed edible surplus food is proposed for the reuse mostly at the consumption service stage food banks retail stage when food is div erted directly from retailers to the secondary retailer such as wefood in denmark wefood but also at the consumption and service stage redistribution of leftovers from catering and restaurants inedible food waste that can be used for animal feed m ay stem from the agricultural production postactivities or processing manufacturing stage a s illustrated on the right hand side by dotted lines all other inedible streams are generated and recirculated at all stages of the fsc where recirculation op tions involving material recycling yellow flows have precedence over those going straight to nutrient and energy recovery orange flows for instance large quantities of mango peels from mango processing can be used as semolina for pasta ajila et al tomato processing waste can be used for carotenoids production a journal preproofjournal preproof colorant that extends the shelf life of food and has many health benefits strati and oreop oulou the vision of f igure is to illustrate how the various stages of the fsc can generate and use fswl and how it can be linked to the food waste hierarchy proposed in figure and the notion of edibility it should also be highlighted that although the inedible streams can be used for material recycling within the fsc as illustrated in figure they can also be used for materials outside the fsc eg as bioplastics teigiserova et al shoes piatex in ramchandani and coste maniere or chemicals mika et al insert figure here in order to prevent eventual rebound effects ie not to encourage any additional generation of fswl as input to feedstock dependent biorefineries left side of fig ure there is a need to establish distinct degrees of priorities for inedible streams for which the fswl categories are very useful the priorities are illustrated in figure the vision is to ensure that additional fswl generation is prevented there fore the partly avoidable food waste streams inedibility due to natural conditions or poor management categories iv v are found at the bottom priorit y streams such as those stemming from dairy and red meat productio n represent the lowest priority priority the rationale is the same as explained for prevention in the food waste pyramid figure namely to target the most resource intensive and polluting food items like those for which preventing rebound effect s is the most important waste com ing from processing industry category ii such as rice husks and category iii may be more interesting for biorefineries given the potential volumes and uniform streams it can generate hence it is proposed as priority and the vision is that priori ty and streams enter biorefineries only after enforcing optimization efforts to minimize their generation in the first place insert figure here journal preproofjournal preproof discussion limitations the challenge of measuring fswl our work introduced several new terms to make it easier to deal with food waste in the upcoming era of the circular economy yet the boundaries of wording clarification and concepts categorization must also meet those of quantification when it comes to implementing concrete policies and evaluate their efficiency up till now consistently with the famous adage you cannot manage what cannot be measured most studies have focused on quantifiable recycling and recovery strategies eriksson et al vea et al galanakis the complexity of quantifyi ng prevention the top priority policy wise has already been acknowledged in fact it has been highlighted as the least measurable among the waste hierarchy treatments mourad prevention from the primary production to the retail can be achieved by more efficient management however the consumer stage is pa rticularly challenging to influence and measure as it involves many factors that interact together these factors include economic motives soci al drivers and cultural pressure as well as individual preference s while economic reasons eg saving money are a driving force for behavioral change thyberg and tonjes socio psychological motivations such as conservatism misinformation and bureaucratic resistance can rep resent up to of difficulties for waste prevention henningsson et al economic factors are further influenced by geographic cultural political and personal reasons linked to food waste generation thyberg and tonjes with different countries having different waste generation patterns this being said searchinger et al highlighted different generic easy tooperate strategies for prevention such as smaller portion sizes in r estaurants at a different price and avoiding journal preproofjournal preproof misleading sell by dates in retail stores as already practi sed in the united kingdom lipinksi et al distinguishing the terms proposed in tab le can be a challenging task mainly surplus food and partly avoidable food as surplus food refer s to edible food this varies per region as well as per individual preference each country and region have their own eating habits and partly avoidab le food waste can largely vary therefore countries should aim to make a list of inedible items considered inedible by the majority in order to improve the quantifications of the waste for instance by engaging expert s and performing questio nnaires for consumer preference this should be parallel with developing an understanding of where and why fswl occurs as highlighted by searchinger et al generally being nondigestible by humans is a valid criteria for inedib ility such as pits and bones but there are food items that are known to be eaten by some while not eaten by others such as mentioned chicken feet and kiwi peels if incentives should be established to reduce this stream at the consumer level clear boundaries at the management scale local regional would need to be established along with clear measurement metrics quantifications of the consumers waste can sometimes be based on consumers data such as diaries weighting source separation and similar therefore consumers understanding of the definitions is important using the term surplus food with the clarification of how it differs from food waste is highly relevant to increase the reuse by humans garrone et al accordin g to th e results of the study by papargyropoulou et al the distinction between surplus food and food waste is also an important food security issue food loss on the other hand was here defined by its intrinsic ch aracteristic of never been measured by using very efficient quantification methods food loss is ideally zero with all surplus food journal preproofjournal preproof redistributed and reused and all food waste reused for animal feed material recycling or nutrient and energy recovery interpreting the proposed framework s for multi valuable output processes proposed fswl hierarchy figure updated circular economy model figure and prioritization for the use of fw in ce figure are guidance tools and as often the case with such tools generic rules covering all cases are almost impossible to establish while material recycling prime s over nutrient and energy recovery i n practice exceptions should be allowed w ith a pr oper evaluation to confirm t he exception status other options might be more environmental fswl is not independent of the developments happening in the other sectors of society and should not be considered in silo this can especially be the case when cascading production takes place and multiple outputs challenge the priorities presented in our proposed fswl hierarchy figure for instance a certain food waste stream may be driven to ad as a result of increasing investments into renewable gas triggered by other streams although energy recovery comes at the bottom of the fswl pyramid such case is not necessarily to proscribe especially taking into account that it also generate s a digestate that can be refined into eg biopesticides cerda et al here considered as material recycling the gas may similarly be refined into plat form molecules for eg the chemical sector another example of multi functional eol technologies generating environmentally valuable co products can include those where biochar elkhalifa et al andor activated carbon zhao et al are generated such as pyrolysis the activated carbon and biochar can uptake heavy metals thereby improving the regenerative nature and health of the soil according to ipcc certain biochars can be used not only for carbon sequestration but also to improve water holding capacity and nu trient use efficiency in soil and even increase the yield in tropics however any management strategies for fswl would need to journal preproofjournal preproof be evaluated by tools such as life cycle assessment to prove their environmental performance when compared to the alternative treatments within a specific context food waste categories some streams may be seen as classifiable into more than one of the categories presented in table for instance orange peels stemming from juice production could belong to categori es ii and iii at the same time but peels being inherently inedible belong to category ii this could pose problems in an accounting context and would require further categorization principles for instance it could be decided to classify unavoidable food waste streams into category ii first and then category iii processing additional work could also consider combining these catego ries with the stages of the fsc in a step wise decision tree for classifying fswl time dimension short value chains for fswl management as fswl is highly degradable short management cycles are of tremendous importance particular ly in the context of a warmer climate ipcc food waste processed immediately for any eol could be considered as minimization of lowquality waste generation figure short fswl management cycles in fact prevent the degradation of the content in the unavoidable and partly unavoidable waste category ii iv in table to be reintroduced as the new materials in the case of recyc ling fw in the short chains the costs for transportation treatment of waste costs of raw material energy need and others costs are furthermore generally decreased chertow short management cycles of fswl are likely to be favored in industrial symbiosis or decentralized systems where geographic proximity allows immediate use of the waste fraction eu examples are presented in short et al among others on the prevention side searchinger et al propose to establish additi onal local food banks combined with third party scheduled retrieval journal preproofjournal preproof services making re distribution shorter and easier from farms and retail stores to food banks internet apps informing food banks of the availability of surplus food in near real time do exist lipinski et al and can further enhance the efficiency of this prevention strategy perspectives our analysis of selected european framework and policies showed th at steps towards ss have been taken but need further refining to achieve ss in the european law for instance decreasing waste of animal origin needs improved legislation on its re use european council while ce derived fertilizer need s stronger limits for heavy metal content to ensure healthy soil systems european parliament european parliament euwide initiatives such as the circular economy indicators mentioned in table eurostat and initiatives mentioned in t able are helping to promote fswl prevention reuse recycling and recovery on each stage of the fsc further there is an issue with the meaning of the word prevention the waste framework directive defines prevention as measures taken before a substance material or product has become waste that reduce s a the quantity of waste including through the reuse of products or the extension of the life span of products b the adverse impacts of the generated w aste on the environment and human health european parliament strictly applying this official definition implies that using fw directly in the short chains eg in the industrial symbiosi s can be counted as prevention ie preventing waste usable for applications at the top of the hierarchy pyramid to become waste of lower quality for use at the bottom of the pyramid a distinction between the two types of prevention of beco ming fswl in the first place and becoming food waste of lower quality than already is could be the topic for more exploration as highlighted throughout this study definitions need to be very clear and transparent in order to support the strong sustainable circular economy journal preproofjournal preproof the suggested clarified food waste hierarchy and closed loop framework as well as our proposed categories of food are seen as important stepping stones towards sustainable management of fswl these categories can provide business and po licy decision support on how to reach the sdg target and further transition towards the circular economy it can be further used by policy makers and managers to prioritize the efforts and analyze the trends and efficiency of the circular econom y in europe for food waste conclusion this article has summarized categorized and clarified the common definitions and terms for food waste here referred to as food surpluses waste and losses fswl the term food loss is proposed to only refer to not accounted for surplus food to all edible food fit for human consumption and the rest belonging to food waste introducing the term surplus food into the waste hierarchy has been stressed out as important for prevention and reuse of food for hum an consumption three useful tools that can improve quantification methods have been introduced category matrix for fswl updated food waste hierarchy and circular economy framework for fswl linking edibility and degree of possible avoidance resulted in six categories for food which can be used to measure fswl more efficiently and contribute to knowledge on unavoidabilityedibility of the waste at each part of the fsc the levels of the food waste hierarchy have been expanded by material recy cling due to economic potential of unavoidable food waste with nutrient and energy r ecovery as separate categories due to importance of addressing nitrogen flows and other nutrient s these clarified eol treatments can support faster intervention which is critical for highly perishable wastage in strong sustainability context the prioritization framework for the use of fswl into biorefin eries was introduced this article stressed out that emission intensity of food waste prevention or journal preproofjournal preproof used for biorefiner ies should also be considered ce framework can improve and uncover valorization of food wa ste in the supply chain with many examples sho wcasing closed loop pathways included proper implementation of transparent fswl valorization need s to be supported by policies even though steps towards ss have been taken mostly by launching of the circular economy framework and to some extent the bioeconomy strategy policies need to be harmonized towards the common goal of prevention and eol accor ding to the fswl hierarchy implementation of the proposed tools can help to harmonize objectives of reduction and regulation of fswl in policies acknowledgement the authors would like to give a special thanks to michele marini for his help the
