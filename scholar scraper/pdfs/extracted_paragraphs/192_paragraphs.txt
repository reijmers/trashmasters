The current literature has yet to be fully developedgiven the complexity of the corresponding concept and knowledge. Traditional bibliometric analysis lacks the ability to screen out important keywords for future directions, and the keyword frequencies are described numerically. This study applies the entropy weight method to convert the frequencies toweights and performs regional comparisons based on a database; hence, this study contributes to the literature by providing potential future directions. The database includes 413 published articles, and 41 indicators are listed. The results are used to identify valid indicators for improvement and provide aregional state-of-the-art comparison. The top 5 indicators for future study are incineration, life cycleassessment, plastic waste, sorting solid waste, and sustainability. A bibliographic coupling analysis provides a comparison of 5 regions and reveals that Africa and North America have less studies than other regions. ©2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The principal premises of a circular economy  have emerged as closed and slowing loops, in which closed loops pertain to post- consumer waste recycling; slowing refers to product value reten- tion through maintenance, repair and refurbishment, and rema- nufacturing to produce ef ﬁciency improvements in the ordinary linear economy . A CE emerges when the value of resources, materials and products is preserved as long as possible in the economy, and the generation of waste serves as a tactic to develop low-carbon resource ef ﬁciency and competitive sustainability . Waste management, particularly solid waste management  andmunicipal solid waste management , is the foundation for a CE to achieve more waste prevention and better resource man- agement by extending and closing the material cycles that account for waste input-output to create inventories of economic ﬂows . However, the relation- ships between MSWM and CE entities are blurred in the existing literature, and these concepts are diffuse since they were proposed by different viewpoints in different ﬁelds . Corresponding ways of theoretical understanding remain unclear because of deliberation regarding MSWM and CE concepts (Anshassi et al., 2019 ;Blomsma and Brennan, 2017 ;Bocken et al., 2017b ). Nevertheless, geographic advantages are achieved through supplementary ef ﬁcient material cycles and reverse logistics with synergistic proximity to municipal waste sources and potential industrial source involvement . For instance, Zeller et al.  argued that adequate resource mea- sures for effective market supply and demand and the ability to form municipal organizations and strategy are perceived as critical*Corresponding author.

Pires and Martinho  argued that an understanding of regional CE knowledge is needed to foster environmental outcomes and the total resource management chain. Understanding MSWM in a CE at the regional level is necessary to improve practices. As previously mentioned, MSWM in a CE remains limited, and qualitative and quantitative approaches and analyses are lacking ( Korhonen et al., 2018a ;Pires and Martinho, 2019 ;Zeller et al., 2019 ). There are challenges and opportunities for the development of MSWM in a CE since MSWM is increasingly complex and a CE has problems in practice, while a systematic literature examination indicates that the contributions of MSWM in a CE remain unrevised and need to be clari ﬁed. Sys- tematic qualitative and quantitative approaches provide an over- view of the state of the art of MSWM in a CE for future study directions and improvements in practice. The objectives of this study are as follows: /C15To describe MSWM in a CE and map the ﬁeld with proposed indicators from valid data sources /C15To explore the knowledge gaps in geographical regions based on a proposed hybrid approach Quantitative and qualitative approaches are proposed to enhance the outcomes of the systematic review. A hybrid method, including bibliometric analysis, the fuzzy Delphi method, and the entropy weight method, is proposed. Bibliometric analysis is used to visualize an overview of the bibliometric status and to reveal the indicators of MSWM in a CE from the data of all publications in the Scopus database, and the results are presented as visual informa- tion . The fuzzy Delphi method aims to screen out unnecessary indicators based on expert judgments due to the complexity of a CE and the diversity of problems ( Tseng, 2009 ; Tseng and Bui, 2017 ). The entropy weight method is applied to transform the indicator frequency data into comparable weights to determine the performance of regions on the indicators and to identify the critical indicators for improvement in this study ( Wang et al., 2015 ;Tseng, 2017 ). This study contributes to  identifying important knowledge to assist further studies and the implementation of practices,  delivering guidelines regarding the directions of future studies by reviewing the bibliometric status of MSWM in a CE and identifying the critical indicators that need further examination, and  addressing the challenges and gaps among geographical regions to provide local viewpoints of MSWM in a CE. The second section discusses related literature on a CE and MSWM. The third section more clearly presents the data collection process, methodologies, and proposed analytical steps. The results are revealed in the fourth section. The ﬁfth section identi ﬁes future challenges and discusses regional comparisons of MSWM in a CE. Finally, conclusions are drawn in the last section. 2. Literature review2.1. Municipal solid waste management MSWM is de ﬁned as complex procedures comprising waste collection routes, transfer station locations, treatment and energy recovery strategies, and waste treatment techniques are the core means to achieve objectives, including human health and envi- ronmental protection, economic development, and ful ﬁllment of social and regulatory requirements .Sharholy et al.  claimed that ef ﬁcient MSWM requires support from both authorities and citizens, where the latter are individuals with evolving community awareness and societal interest. Soltani et al.  presented that MSWM is a complex procedure involvingmultiple decisive factors, such as environmental effects, related economic outlays and bene ﬁ ts, regional features, and political and social issues. Therefore, sustainable MSWM is necessary for all stages of the system, from design, scheduling and neutralization to the preservation of environmental quality for future development goals . It is necessary to identify planning and monitoring methods for SWM to reduce the generated amount of waste, to recycle some waste with high economic value, and to deﬁne indicators that support that a suitable direction is important . For solid waste intervention in a CE, Lee  developed a recycling investment sustainability framework that involves un- certain petitions and nonlinear recycling expenses to balance existing manufacturing restrictions, production bene ﬁts, and recycling investments for a sustainable CE. Tisserant et al.  presented waste treatment and waste footprint scales to design and assess policy instruments for a CE. Murphy and Pincetl  showed that material ﬂows are rounded up in a CE, with mate- rials being used repeatedly to optimize consumption with no wasted materials; the products are reused, repaired or redis- tributed within the system at the end of life. If they cannot bereused or repaired, products can be recycled or recovered from waste and used as inputs, replacing the need to exploit natural resources .Ghisellini et al.  andRicha et al.  suggested that a CE aims to prevent and eliminate waste by cycling materials or used products within a closed-loop scheme to obtain energy and resource effectiveness and pro ﬁtability. Ness and Xing  proposed that a CE aims to have no remaining in ﬂuence on the ecosystem by recovering resource procurement damage while minimizing the waste produced through manufacturing and product life cycles. Waste reduction through recycling is stressed under the principal points of reducing raw material consumption, designing products in an eco-design manner, lengthening product lifetimes through maintenance and repair, and recycling and using products and raw materials recovered from waste ﬂows. However, theoretical developments are not coherent for this concept and do not align with MSWM and a CE because zero-waste perceptions are limited, as even in closed-loop systems, resources are consumed and at least some waste is certainly produced ( Blomsma and Brennan, 2017 ;Niero and Kalbar, 2019 ). In lieu of this discussion, the role of MSWM in a CE is irreplaceable and important for guaranteeing the precision of this supplementary approach. 2.2. Circular economy A CE is a business operationalization concept whose imple- mentation for sustainable development has been much debated. The concept stems from the Earth ’s limited capability to acclimatize to contamination in reaction to the necessity of economic devel- opment and resource consumption along with environmental in- ﬂuences .Jiao and Boons  indicated that the concept involves the actions of reducing, reusing, and recycling in the progression of production, consumption and cir- culation. Van Buren et al.  proposed creating a triple bottom line with the social, environmental and economic dimensions of a CE.Mendoza et al.  stated that a CE should take full advantage of resource ef ﬁciency, including  conserving and improving natural wealth by monitoring ﬁnite stocks and assessing renewable resource ﬂows;  optimizing resource utility, products, processes, and materials within technological and biological circularity; and  promoting ef ﬁcient coordination by disclosing and controlling undesirable externalities. Ness and Xing  suggested that a CE aims to achieve more value and to reduce material throughput by involving resource utilization and management, closed-loop ap- proaches, adaptation strategies, and sharing economy models.F.M. Tsai, T.-D. Bui, M.-L. Tseng et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 275  124132 2 In contrast, waste prevention in a CE includes reuse, refurbish- ment, and remanufacturing of material ﬂows ( Pires and Martinho, 2019 ). The fundamentals surpass a reuse loop and include rema- nufacturing, recycling and reprocessing to recover secondary components and return them to the same usage. Some end-of-life products and materials might shift to other processes, such as ex- ports for reuse in another location; change to lower applications , or be discharged from the system in the form of waste . The increasing growth in prior studies informs an evidence-based formulation of a CE and its implications for innovation. Kirchherr et al.  conceptualized a model from the most frequent depictions of a CE by reviewing 114 de ﬁnitions. Reike et al.  explored con- troversies in a CE through a focus on reviewing the literature and resource value retention options to provide a heuristic that is useful in practice. Lacson et al.  revealed ﬂuoride networks and a CE as potential models for sustainable development because discard- ing of existing waste is reliant on incineration and the problems posed by land ﬁlling in a linear economy model worsen environ- mental problems. The initial uncertainty and con ﬂicts regarding a CE remain due to various practical activities. Identifying CE chal-lenges in a sustainable global network scheme is an urgent problem . A systematic review of MSWM in a CE is still lacking in the literature. 2.3. MSWM in a CE from regional perspectives Geographic advantage is achieved through supplementary ef ﬁ- cient material cycles and reverse logistics. Adequate resource proximity measures for market supply and demand effectiveness and the shaping capability of municipal planning and regulation frameworks are considered fundamental to a region ’s unique po- sition in a CE system . For instance, the European Union is currently leading in policy implementation and endorsing new ambitious procedures to promote a CE with the most modern waste legislation . The concept in- volves reusable products and recyclable materials, such as metals, plastics, paper, and glass, and producing goods from organic waste . Performing CE functions to upcycle waste management is pigeonholed by the use of materials, labor, and capital in each speci ﬁc region and its technology and/or innovation level . In North America, including the United States, a CE highlights waste reduction, reuse and recycling over disposal . Japan and China are the key players in Asia to of ﬁcially present a CE. Geng et al.  worked on CO 2reductions for situations of municipal symbiosis in Kawasaki, Japan. Fang et al.  indicated carbon footprint and resource savings in Chinese national pilot cities. More nuanced grading with tinier decision loops such as restructuring, refur- bishing, and repurposing to enable resource value retention over multiple product life cycles has recently been emphasized in a CE . Stahel  argued that a CE of reused products and recycling materials is ordinary in less-developed regions, where the CE be-gins with an end-of-life product that is utilized to yield new con- sumption under a grave-to-cradle assessment; thus, this approach reduces both the volume of waste generated in the lower value chain and the demand for virgin resources in the upper value chain. However, Diaz  claimed that the original causes of low levels of a CE in countries such as those in Latin America and the Carib- bean and Africa are weak political motivation; a lack of national waste management policy and legislation; inadequate budgets to implement a CE; and a lack of professional expertise, training and education at all levels. These causes led to the occurrence of informal reuse, recycling and recovery markets and raised variousquestions regarding the CE concept. Therefore, exploring MSWM in a CE is expected to improve the economy, conserve the environ- ment and protect social fairness by offering an alternative model that is cyclical and reformative and that replaces traditional linear processes . 3. Methods This section more clearly presents the data collection process, bibliometric analysis, fuzzy Delphi method, entropy weight method, and proposed analytical steps. 3.1. Proposed analytical steps This study provides a data-driven bibliometric analysis from a literature review, identifying indicators for improving further studies and for accurately determining the differences in the status of research on MSWM in a CE in different regions. The analytical steps followed are as follows: 1. The search terms are identi ﬁed, and the publication database is ﬁltered using the Scopus website. 2. Bibliographic analysis is then conducted to ﬁnd the indicators of MSWM in a CE from the database using VOSviewer software. 3. The fuzzy Delphi method is adopted to re ﬁne the essential in- dicators. Experts ’opinions from a questionnaire are used to assess the proposed indicators. 4. The frequencies of the indicators are generated, and the entropy weight method is applied to transform the entropy of the in- dicators into comparable scales. In this study, regional com- parisons are carried out. 5. The critical indicators are identi ﬁed by subtracting the global weight of the fuzzy Delphi method from the entropy weight to examine the study gaps. The details of the analytical process are described in Fig. 1 . 3.2. Data collection Appendix A presents the literature review of studies on a CE or MSWM that engaged in a systematic analysis approach. The Scopus database is employed in this study due to its wider coverage of publications and greater amount of relevant bibliometric data than those of other databases ( He et al., 2017 ;Jin et al., 2018 ;Meho and Rogers, 2008 ). The collected data consist of several identi ﬁers: the title, abstract, citation record, author, author af ﬁliation, author keywords, country, and year of publication. A coding framework was developed for an iterative search process based on the authors ’ initial knowledge and the preliminary literature review. Municipal solid waste covers numerous components, including food, paper, plastics, metals, textiles, and glass; it differs based on different cultures, policies and legislation and depends on the main economic features of regions . Solid waste refers to the waste generated by local communities, industrial zones, com- mercial areas, conventional construction sites, demolition pro- cesses and civic services . It contains all products associated with daily activities such as packaging, bottles, discarded food, newspapers, equipment, devices, batteries and dyes. Municipal solid waste refers to waste in a solid form produced in the course of daily activities by households and industrial, institutional and commercial establishments: waste from schools, ofﬁces, institutions, stores, hotels and supermarkets and from communal services such as yards, markets, hospitals, entertain- ment venues, and street cleaning ( Arıkan et al., 2017 ;Yukalang et al., 2017 ). As a result, the following search terms were used:F.M. Tsai, T.-D. Bui, M.-L. Tseng et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 275  124132 3 “"circular economy ”or “circular economic" ”and “"solid waste ”or “urban waste ”or “e-waste ”or " electronic waste ”or “construction waste ”or “household waste ”or “demolition waste ”or “plastic waste ”or “medical waste" “. The inquiries were performed on September 12, 2019, with no chronological restrictions. The search results were generated from the titles, abstracts, or keywords, with no constraints imposed on the date of publication; additionally, the results were limited to only English articles and reviews. A total of 413 articles and reviews were generated, with the ﬁrst published in 2008, proving that MSWM in a CE is a concept from the last decade. 3.3. Bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis investigates the formal properties of knowledge domains by using mathematical and statistical methods .Fahimnia et al.  referred to bibliometric analysis as a tool that provides powerful network analysis to identify established and emerging topical areas based on study topic, author and institu- tional characteristics. Zupic and /C20Cater  proposed that the method is a quantitative technique to handle increasing amounts of existing literature. In particular, bibliometric analysis provides in- formation about a study ﬁeld and  helps make handling a largenumber of publications easier and more reliable;  deeply ana- lyzes the relationships among articles, citations, co-citations and keywords; and  provides strong visualization ability, which helps readers easily and clearly identify future research interests in aﬁeld . Therefore, this method has the potential to be applied to explore CEs, as a knowledge sphere that has not yet been fully understood . The bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer 1.6.11 software . The VOSviewer open- source software tool offers suf ﬁcient features to scienti ﬁcally map the literature through document grouping that categorizes docu-ments into expressive relationships by grouping documents that are related to each other into one cluster to describe the network among them. In the academic ﬁeld, VOSviewer has been applied to map knowledge in arti ﬁcial intelligence ( Shukla et al., 2019 ), green building construction , and SWM ( Deus et al., 2018 ). Thus, VOSviewer is appropriate for visualizing a biblio- metric network and identifying the MSWM indicators in a CE in this study through bibliographic coupling among the nodes; this coupling denotes the topic area and represents the countries and the linkages in the keywords of previous studies. This study uses this software to generate bibliometric information, including Fig. 1. Analytical procedure. Note: ofmsw - Organic fraction of MSW.F.M. Tsai, T.-D. Bui, M.-L. Tseng et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 275  124132 4 keywords, titles, and abstracts, to capture potential indicators from the database. 3.4. Fuzzy Delphi method Ishikawa et al.  proposed the combination of fuzzy set theory and the Delphi method to obtain a decision group to deal with the fuzziness of experts ’decisions and to improve the quality of questionnaires. The combination ’s advantages of reducing the number of respondents and the inquiry period provide an ef ﬁcient assessment of expert knowledge that is appropriate for trans- forming expert opinions into accurate data to obtain additional beneﬁts regarding decision-making time and cost . In this study, 30 experts were approached face-to-face to ensure the reliability of the evaluation processes. The experts in the group had more than 10 years of experience working in and studying MSWM; the group included 15 experts from academia, 8 experts from government agencies and 7 experts from practical wastemanagement organizations. The signi ﬁcance value of the indicator bwas evaluated by expert aasj¼ðx ab;yab;zabÞ, where a¼1;2;3;…;nand b¼1;2;3;…;m; the weight jbofbisjb¼ðxb;yb;zbÞ, where xb¼minðxabÞ,yb¼ ðYn 1yabÞ1=n, and zb¼maxðzabÞ. Then, the linguistic references and triangular fuzzy numbers were converted into linguistic values, as presented in Table 1 .

Entropy weight method This study analyzed the differences in geographical regions us- ing the entropy weight method. The entropy weight method re- ﬂects the utility value of an indicator and gives more reliable indicator weights when revising information . The method quanti ﬁes the disorganization of a system that isapplied in weight measurement by using an indicator with a large entropy mean, and a great diversity of responses makes the indi- cator have a more substantial impact on the system reaction ( Tseng, 2017 ;Wen et al., 1998 ). First, a content analysis, as a tool to study documents and communication objects based on systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts , was employed for regional consistency checks of the codes independent of particular regions. To avoid repeating the same completed coding and to enhance the reliability of the results, all coding was tracked in a parallel Excel ﬁle. The indicator frequencies for each region were counted by searching regional data generated from publications on MSWM in a CE using country codes . For instance, the search term “TITLE-ABS-KEY ( “Argentina ”or“Bolivia ”or “Brazil ”or “Chile ”or “Colombia ”or “Ecuador ”or “Mexico") ”was used to collect the regional data for Latin America and the Caribbean. Then, the entropy weights were calculated, and the method involves the function fi:½0;1/C138/½0;1/C138, which ful ﬁlls the following three constraints to monotonically increase the range of x2ð0; 0:5Þ:  fið0Þ¼ 0,  fiðxÞ¼ fið1/C0xÞ, and  fiðxÞ. The largest value of this function occurs at x¼0:5, and the value ðv0:5/C01Þ makes the result fall in the range ½0;1/C138. εrepresents a coef ﬁcient identi ﬁed with a value between zero and one, and the value is generally set to 0.5 as follows: t0;i¼Xn m¼1wmε0;iðmÞfor i¼1;2;3…m  where each determined weight ðwm;Pwm¼1Þis computed using the entropy method. The computational process of the entropy weight method is as follows: Calculating the total coef ﬁcients in all arrangements for each indicator: Cj¼Xn i¼1εiðjÞ  Determining the entropy weight of each indicator: ej¼kXn j¼1we  εiðjÞ ej!  where werefers to the indicator frequency determined by the content analysis.

Results A bibliographic coupling analysis of MSWM in a CE was con- ducted based on the literature. The fuzzy Delphi method and en- tropy weight method results are shown. The critical indicators for future investigations are examined in this section. 4.1. Bibliometric analysis results This study undertakes a co-occurrence bibliographic coupling analysis of author keywords extracted from Scopus (presented in Table 2 ). There are 41 keywords that occur at least 5 times in the analysis, with CE , recycling (occurrence weight equal to 63), waste management , municipal solid waste , e-waste , and sustainability (occurrence weight equal to 22) having the most occurrences among the pub-lications. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of author keywords in the bibliographic coupling analysis. The visualization reveals that the “circular economy ”node represents the central keyword and has network linkages among the rest of the keywords. From this central position, the CE node directly links to the smaller main nodes of municipal solid waste, waste management, sustainability, recy- cling, e-waste, and life cycle assessment , representing the fundamental contributors to the establishment of a CE as an implementation concept for sustainable development through waste reduction, reducing and recycling material throughput by involving closed-loop approaches in production, and circulation progression . The concept was con ﬁrmed to be oriented towards value conservation by covering those MSWM activities based on reuse loops consisting of recycling, remanufacturing, and reprocessing to return them to the usage cycle . The purple nodes comprising waste electrical and electronic equipment, e-waste, environmental waste, and solid waste are related to a CE andMSWM, and this ﬁnding is helpful for explaining the fundamental development of a CE from the waste management viewpoint. The green nodes, comprising recycling, reverse logistics, recovery, municipal solid waste, waste management, sustainability, LCA, and packaging, represent the next phase in the study of CEs as an expansion of production lines and supply chain management. The yellow nodes, comprising plastic waste, biowaste, biogas, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, and developing countries, show the latest keywords of publications in this ﬁeld. There are 69 countries/territories that have accumulated a minimum of 1 document. The bibliographic coupling results by year are shown in Fig. 3 , and the most productive countries/terri- tories include the United Kingdom, China, Italy, the United States, and Spain. The countries that were ﬁrst concerned about CEs included China, Japan, Ghana, Norway, Switzerland, Slovenia, Kenya, and Vietnam, with their earliest years of publication occurring prior to 2017. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, and Brazil followed later, with publication years ranging from 2017 to 2018. The latest publications came from Israel, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, and Qatar, with their earliest years of publication occurring since 2019. Then, the 69countries/territories were separated into ﬁve geographical regions according to the United Nations  for further evaluation . 4.2. Fuzzy Delphi method results From the bibliometric analysis, 41 keywords are proposed for evaluation by the fuzzy Delphi method. The evaluation is based on expert experience and judgments, and linguistic terms are con- verted into corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers, as shown in Table 1 . Then, a technique is implemented to screen out the critical indicators of MSWM in a CE  and ) with the threshold g¼0.613, as presented in Table 4 . A total of 18 keywords are accepted as indicators, including anaerobic digestion, biowaste, developing countries, extended producer responsibility, incinera- tion, industrial ecology, land ﬁll, LCA, material ﬂow analysis, pack- aging, plastic recycling, plastic waste, resource recovery, reverse logistics, sorting, sustainability, waste electrical and electronic equipment, and waste-to-energy. These indicators are considered critical in the MSWM and CE study topics and are listed and numbered in Table 5 . Table 2 List of co-occurrences of author keywords.

Entropy weight method results Table 6 presents the comparable entropy weights of the in- dicators for each region e). The entropy weight method is used to re ﬂect the utility value of an indicator and gives reliable weights when reviewing imperfect data. The entropy weight method uses entropy to represent the size of information. Entropy is a measure of how disorganized a system is when weighting an indicator; an indicator with a large entropy meansthat it has a great diversity of responses and a more signi ﬁcant inﬂuence on the system . The greater the value of an indicator is, the more information that it contains. This means that the larger the entropy value is, the smaller the entropy weight . The smaller the entropy weight is, the more in- formation that is contained in the indicator. Hence, this study uses the weighted average method to identify the level of information contained in the indicators for each region. If the weight is greater than the average, the indicator shows a need for improvement. Fig. 2. Co-occurrence of author keywords by publication year. Fig. 3. Bibliographic coupling of countries/territories by year.F.M. Tsai, T.-D. Bui, M.-L. Tseng et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 275  124132 7 Table 7 shows that Europe has provided the highest amount of information in the ﬁeld of MSWM in a CE, followed by Asia and Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast, Africa and North America show less information. According to the fuzzy Delphi method, the most important weight of each indicator is converted to the global weight. The critical indicators for future challenges are identi ﬁed by subtracting the global weight of the fuzzy Delphi method from the entropy weight. Table 8 shows the indicator rank scores. The top ﬁve indicators are chosen for further discussion, with plastic waste  ranked ﬁrst in the indicator list, showing its urgent need for development as an MSWM and CE study topic. Incineration  and sustainability  rank second and third, followed by sorting solid waste  and LCA  in the fourth and ﬁfth positions, respectively, repre- senting potential research ﬁelds in the future. 5. Discussion This section provides a discussion of future study challenges and implications for the status of different regions. 5.1. Future challenges and directions This subsection discusses challenges and future study gaps based on the top ﬁve indicators, which were determined to be incineration, LCA, plastic waste, sorting solid waste, and sustainability. 5.1.1. Incineration Municipal solid waste is disposed of either by land ﬁlling or through incineration. In fact, waste incineration has recently become a fascinating treatment method. Continuous increases in waste generation, the absence of funding for land ﬁlls and their environmental and public health impacts have prompted anincreased interest in incineration . Inciner- ation is a process of burning municipal solid waste to sterile ash with little environmental impact. In optimal energy recovery and ecological sustainability, incineration decreases the amount of waste by 90% and the volume of mass by 70%; it also provides a possibility of recovering energy in the form of electricity ( Joseph et al., 2018 ;Sebastian et al., 2018 ).Ashraf et al.  proposed a clean closed-loop incineration procedure that utilizes municipal solid waste residues and helps reduce expensive land ﬁll taxes. The feasibility of municipal solid waste incineration is determined by the composition of the municipal solid waste, which is the most crucial criterion; in contrast, the sustainable MSWM selections that are made pose a threat to the environment . Although incineration is supposed to be a pathway to sustainable MSWM, it may not always be a feasible discarding technique, as it largely depends on the waste characteristics, which are dependent on the indigenous demography, sociocultural differences, seasonal changeability and landscape . Incineration is a multifaceted, complicated process with trade-offs among numerous dimensions with a cost-intensive requirement for an extensive practicability assessment of implementation. In practice, the possibility of using incineration outputs such as ash, carbon dioxide, and energy to make cementing material through novel production stages allows a reproduction process within incinerator facilities . Eco-cement production is based exclusively on municipal solid waste inciner- ation residues to maximize the recycling potential. A simulation of solid waste incineration on an advanced technology-driven pack- aging bed with corrected boundary circumstances, homogeneous responses and control methods for pyrolysis products has been introduced . Knowledge of changes in the amount of feed waste and waste characteristics is a tool to determine the economic and environmental feasibility of incineration technology . However, this process remains unpopularTable 3 List of bibliographic coupling of productive countries/territories according to region .

Most previous viability studies have not assigned the appropriate weights to factors such as the environ- mental impact, energy recovery and economic operation indecision-making processes . With the intensi ﬁcation of incineration as a waste treatment technique, an increased emphasis on the demand for all-inclusive instruments for assessing municipal solid waste incinerability has been exploited by both researchers and practitioners. Composite indicators to quantify municipal solid waste incinerability are needed, and methods to measure the fundamental effects are required. 5.1.2. Life cycle assessment LCA is an effective instrument to assess environmental sus- tainability by measuring the resources used and environmental effects related to a product or service with an extensive set of inﬂuencing quanti ﬁcation categories . The ISO standards of LCA involve principles, frameworks, requirements andguidelines ( International Organization for Standardization, 2006a , 2006b ). This indicator is used to capture the causal relationships between resource consumption and the environmental effects of a precise service or manufacturing process and to assess uni ﬁed MSWM systems. ( Hellweg &Mil/C18a i Canals, 2014 ;Liu et al., 2017 ; Yay, 2015 ). LCA is employed to assist in the adoption of environ- mental sustainability of advanced regionalized waste treatment technology for greater environmental bene ﬁts . In the sustainable management of solid waste, LCA has ﬂaws with regard to the speci ﬁcity of a particular location, rendering its use questionable in certain cases .Table 4 Fuzzy Delphi method screening out for indicators.

Through LCA, the social cost of waste polyester recycling has been con ﬁrmed to have environmental effects on climate change, fossil resource shortages, noxiousness and poisonousness to humans, water consumption and global ecotoxicity . For instance, the envi- ronmental effects related to two distinct scenarios of waste man- agement in olive oil production were determined through an LCA comparison between anaerobic digestion and disposal in soil. An attritional LCA of divergent recycling technologies was conducted for postindustrial and postconsumer polylactic acid waste treatment along with chemical recycling and solvent-based recycling . Plastic waste manage- ment options were determined through an LCA of plastic waste recovery for recycled materials, fuel and energy. Using LCA for MSWM in a CE, previous studies have attempted to take a tech- nological system perspective on waste resources ( Huysman et al., 2017 ;Mik et al., 2016 ;Nainggolan et al., 2019 ;Scheepens et al., 2016 ). Although LCA contributes to investigating a waste life cycle, itTable 6 Regional entropy weights.

Although this indicator helps to evaluate ecological effects, there is a scarcity of information about how, where, and to what extent it is applicable to MSWM . As a result, some speci ﬁc worst practices have arisen in isolated stages of LCA, such as repeated neglect in performing the primary objectives of LCA at a substantiated level and a lack of transparency among system possibilities ( Laurent et al., 2014a ). Another de ﬁciency is that LCA is strongly depen- dent on local site situations, which have diverse system boundaries, curtailing in ﬂuencing factors and causing dif ﬁculties in inventory performance because of a lack of information on the local waste composition and a failure to perform sensitivity and uncertainty evaluation . Furthermore, this method has not been extensively adopted for waste prevention and is limited to solid waste categories such as household and construction waste . There is still potential to improve LCA in the context of MSWM in a CE. An amended LCA approach that in- tegrates environmental, economic, social, legal, institutional, and technological aspects is still necessary for the sustainable man- agement of solid waste . 5.1.3. Plastic waste Plastic waste exists in the construction, packaging, and auto- motive sectors as well as in other sectors. It is one of the most prevalent types of waste as a consequence of its popular use and short lifetime . Most plastic wastes are non- biodegradable and take dozens of decades to degrade naturally. All kinds of this waste can begin to degrade by breaking down the chemical bonds, thus releasing free radicals and speeding up polymer chain degradation, causing unsanitary land ﬁlls and aggregating environmental in ﬂuences . In terms of the consumption of large plastic products, minimizing the im- pacts of plastic waste generation on the environment throughrecycling, reuse and applications in new products is necessary . Previous literature has discussed how to minimize the impact of plastic waste ( Dahlbo et al., 2018 ;Hahladakis et al., 2018 ;Milios et al., 2018 ). A cleaner and more sustainable thermal separation process that converts metal plastic waste into high-quality aluminum and hydrocarbon fuel gas was presented ( Yin et al., 2019 ). A preliminary assessment of the antimony concentrations in plastic fractions was made for different classi ﬁcations of plastic waste derived from waste electrical and electronic equipment . Plastic waste was taken from espresso coffeecontainers to study different categories of degradation and to determine the effect of exposure on material properties ( de Bom ﬁm et al., 2019 ). An LCA perspective on plastic waste treatment was provided by putting a plant ’s capacity into an LCA system to compare the environmental in ﬂuences of plastic waste scenarios. Agricultural solid waste on land associated with different crops and plastic applications in rural zones was measured using a speci ﬁc set of plastic waste indicators . However, the lack of information on the types of products and applications and the polymers and contamination in plastic waste limits the ability to identify the recycling potential, thus chal- lenging the design of recovery facilities, system improvements and overall waste management systems . Although plastic waste recovery has been acknowledged, infor- mation about the composition and characteristics of problematic plastic waste is scarce and unavailable. There are still gaps that make it challenging to replace disposable plastic products with “environmentally friendly ”products in an optimal solution. The result is an important turning point in the context of rising costs and a lack of recycling for developing real solutions to address the rapid rise of global plastic consumption ( Barnes, 2019 ;Dauvergne, 2018 ). Plastic alternatives still face questions regarding the avail- ability of raw materials, whether they will be inexpensive enough to be accepted by the market and their harm to the environment after being discharged. Furthermore, current legislation is not environmentally friendly. 5.1.4. Sorting solid waste Municipal solid waste is rich in various valuable recyclable materials, such as plastic, glass, paper, and metal. Effective MSWM can facilitate valuable recyclable material recovery and reduce environmental damage. Waste sorting is a crucial stage in MSWM for material recycling and should receive more attentiont o develop and test a sorting and quality assessment method. Thus, the general reason for studying the quantity and quality of solid waste is to reduce the number of items disposed ( Hossain and Roy, 2019 ). The quality of waste sorting is insuf ﬁcient, and different types of waste are mixed together; additional separation processes are always essential for waste recycling . The role of social in ﬂuence is particularly important for handling the uncertainty of personal recycling responsibility. It is essential to understand the factors that in ﬂuence sorting behavior to suggest tools that can most effectively contribute to promoting wasteTable 8 Indicators ranking.

Tsai, T.-D. Bui, M.-L. Tseng et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 275  124132 11 separation and contribute to an enhanced and more operative application of recycling programs. The continuous rise in house- hold solid waste has received signi ﬁcant global attention, and waste sorting is regarded as an effective tool to reduce the waste disposal volume. A comparison of motivation eintention ebehavior in regard to household solid waste sorting has been carried out to enhance our understanding of the determinants of household solid waste sorting behavior . Win-win results in waste sorting behavior were suggested to identify differences in waste separation performance among handling systems ( Nguyen and Watanabe, 2019 ). As a precondition for the cumulative circularity of resource ﬂows in the economy, waste is preserved in discrete resource varieties to improve the effectiveness and cost of different waste treatment and sorting mechanisms . However, in developing and developed countries, low recycling levels of solid waste are evident. There is no clear concept of quality assessment, and the results of solid waste sorting are very uncer- tain . It is necessary to identify processes that promote waste separation in effective ways, as well as proposed methods to identify precise waste; thus, the potential for enhancing collection is essential. There are still gaps for further study on thepotential for minimizing and separating waste. Research on the completion of waste sorting equipment lines, the development of recycling, the minimization of waste at the source and at transfer points before sorting and treatment processes, and sorting without dedicated activities is needed to focus and deploy SWM at many levels to meet the requirements of daily life. 5.1.5. Sustainability CE thinking highlights reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery , with a focus on the net environmental or sustainable output over the ﬁnal discharge ( Chen et al., 2017a ,2017b ;Kirchherr et al., 2017 ; Malinauskaite et al., 2017 ;Silva et al., 2017 ). However, regional and local waste information systems are often not available or reliable and cannot be restricted to assist decision-making processes and to handle the challenges of integrated management. Although sustain- ability practices have been implemented, many regions and localities still present poor waste management. As unsustainable MSWM has increased, concerns overoverconsumption and its consequences have grown signi ﬁcantly . Nevertheless, less infor- mation has been obtained from the cultural perspective, and changes in the generation of socioenvironmental problems have been ques- tioned in the ﬁeld of MSWM ( de Souza Melar /C19ee ta l . ,2 0 1 7 ;Martinez- Alier, 2014 ;Pereira and Fernandino, 2019 ). In addition, the continuous escalation of MSWM has brought serious global attention to management of waste in a sustainable manner and to SWM decisions . MSWM is a cross-cutting problem that affects all sustainability domains (triple bottom line) and emphasizes the position of combining its political precedence . The use of sustainability in- dicators for calculations by public administrators and metropolitan employees is also common. Pereira and Fernandino  evalu- ated the MSWM quality in a coastal metropolis and tested the implementation of a system of indicators. A relevant set of sus- tainability indicators was selected to investigate MSWM in large and medium-sized cities worldwide and was applied in three municipalities . An overview has been provided to an extensive range of existing MSWM strategies with the main purposes of designating present technologies, innovative strate- gies, and monitoring assessments that prevail in waste manage- ment situations in different regions as well as possible approaches to sustainable solid waste recycling and utilization . Based on existing studies, holistic approaches to monitoring MSWM on a global scale are still lacking. The major challenges, suchas waste generation, collection, transportation and logistics, treat- ment and disposal, remain gaps for further investigation ( Baawain et al., 2017 ;Hietala et al., 2018 ;Hassan et al., 2016 ;Loan et al., 2019 ; Mmereki et al., 2016 ). 5.2. Regional discussion on MSWM in a CE This study shows that Europe has the highest number of pub- lications in the ﬁeld of MSWM in a CE, followed by Asia and Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast, Africa and North America currently have fewer studies, indicating that there is still plenty of room for further exploration. Africa addresses wide-ranging and multifaceted MSWM prob- lems. Municipal solid waste is normally disposed of without any consideration of its ecological and human health effects. Dumpsites are basically uncontrolled or poorly managed. However, current waste treatment technologies are incapable of being applied in this region due to their high cost . Most African cities are now facing challenges from poor public service management due to insuf ﬁcient and failing infrastructure caused by underinvestment. Furthermore, even adequate MSWM infrastructure cannot cope withthe excess waste, leading to excessive leakage of plastic waste into the natural environment, including through some on-site plastic waste locations, especially along the coastlines . This situation has contributed to common unsanitary events, such as poor solid waste and wastewater disposal, resulting in heavy pollution of heavy metals, persistent organic contaminants and biological ef ﬂu- ence in water resources. North America has fewer articles even though the region is composed of rich and developed countries. The region ’s approach to SWM has evolved over time from open discarding to integrated waste management moving in the direction of a proactive approach . In North America, effective waste reduction is largely driven by policies and legislation combined with suitable technologies and economic procedures. Hence, the status quo is not necessarily improved. High living standards and income per capita are connected to high rejection rates, resulting in very large amounts of waste . Indeed, cities have stopped recycling municipal waste due to its high cost and the low pro ﬁts from recy- cling activities. The region sends its waste to other regions and often achieves extremely poor waste management performance ( Barnes, 2019 ). The result is an important crisis that requires reconsidering the policy of exporting waste over long distances to develop real solutions under the situation of escalating global consumption . Under such circumstances, dif ﬁcult challenges still endure. Elements of ecological superiority, municipal well-being and consciousness, resource crises, and alternative energy in sus- tainable waste systems should receive more attention. Overall, the concept of MSWM in a CE has received extensive attention over the last decade and has become a principal point for progressing towards achieving regional sustainable development . As a result, the uncertainties and complexities are growing deeper and faster than the extent to which decision makers are capable of responding. The improve- ments are inadequate in the face of such escalating challenges, and a lack of quality assessments is causing a large number of problemsthat need to be solved to exploit the potential of MSWM in a CE. 6. Concluding remarks This study presents a review of a bibliometric analysis of MSWM in a CE, identi ﬁes indicators for improvement and provides a regional state-of-the-art comparison. This study proposes a hybrid approach to enhance traditional bibliometric analysis. The pro- posed hybrid method includes bibliometric analysis, the fuzzyF.M. Tsai, T.-D. Bui, M.-L. Tseng et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 275  124132 12 Delphi method and the entropy weight method. VOSviewer soft- ware is used in the bibliometric analysis to visualize an overview of the bibliometric status by applying data obtained from the Scopus database and presenting the results as visual information. The fuzzy Delphi method aims to screen out unnecessary indicators based on expert judgments. The entropy weight method trans- forms the indicator frequencies into comparable weights to deter- mine the performance of different regions on the indicators and to identify the critical indicators. This study contributes to the litera- ture as follows: 1. A data-driven systematic review is presented. Bibliographic coupling analysis identi ﬁes 41 keywords, and 18 indicators are accepted as critical concerns based on expert evaluation. The following top ﬁve indicators are chosen: incineration, LCA, plastic waste, sorting waste, and sustainability are potential avenues for further investigation and offer the opportunity to identify priorities for speculation. 2. A total of 69 countries/territories are included, which are then rearranged into 5 regions: Asia and Oceania, Europe, North America, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The re-sults show that Europe has the highest number of publications in the ﬁeld of MSWM in a CE, followed by Asia and Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast, Africa and North America have fewer publications than the other regions. The challenges and gaps among different geographical regions not only contribute local viewpoints for investigation but also offer the global state of the art of MSWM in a CE. Hence, this study can serve as a reference for the decision making of MSWM and CE actors. 3. The government and professionals can ﬁnd useful information for policy design and practical planning from different regional perspectives to promote innovation. Africa and North America are con ﬁrmed to have fewer publications. In particular, Africa is in urgent need of improvement since current waste treatment technologies cannot be applied in this region due to their high cost. This study provides overall insights into the complex study background and intensively broadens the scope of MSWM in a CE. Future studies need to align quality incentives for solid waste processing to CE practices as well as a focus linked to production and consumption perspectives and develop the gaps in MSWM in a CE to improve the roles of ﬁrms, governments and professionals in fostering innovative implementations.  Future studies should examine incineration intensi ﬁcation as a sustainable instrument for assessing sustainable development practices;  LCA approachesshould be amended to integrate conceptual CE aspects for the sustainable management of solid waste;  Future studies corre- spondingly need to focus on and deploy SWM methods, including relevant differences regarding CE consumption behaviors to meet daily life requirements;  Plastic waste issues should be better emphasized in future research as a precedence to frame a clearer link between a CE and sustainability due to large-scale environ- mental disputes; and  Elaboration of MSWM and CE effects in terms of sustainability, such as a reduction in carbon emissions or the curbing of waste and pollution, should be given further consideration. Nevertheless, this study entails certain limitations. Although Scopus has a broad scope with regard to indexing publications, there are some limitations in regard to the inclusion of low-impact sources and updating the latest articles . This discussion may not be detailed enough to perform a quality assessment, and future research should employ more condensed data for better results. This study provides an in-depth technique for data-driven analysis, and future research should examine both academic and practical investigations in this ﬁeld.
