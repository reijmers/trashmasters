4.1. Emissions Avoided
Throughout 2016, a total of 594 tons of recycled material were collected; of this amount, 51%
corresponded to paper and cardboard, 25.08% to plastics, 12.12% to glass, and 11.28% to scrap metal.
To calculate the emissions avoided, it is assumed that 100% of the recycled material was used by the
ﬁnal industry to replace virgin raw materials.
As a result of the recycled material collection activity among 82 recyclers, 288.70 tCO 2-eq was
avoided due to the replacement of virgin raw material. The abatement of CH 4emissions due to
avoiding the inclusion of paper and cardboard waste from the Pichacay landﬁll was 2738 tCO 2-eq.
We did not consider emissions from transport and non-energy processes. Paper and cardboard
represented 90.5% of the total emissions avoided, mainly due to the deviation of material in landﬁlls.
The remaining 9.5% of emissions were produced from the use of recycled material.
Table 3 shows the results, and these are consistent with the literature of [ 25,78,79], which establish
the reduction of 0.57–0.78 tCO 2-eqper ton of paper, 0.45–1.83 tCO 2-eqper ton of plastic, 0.03–0.5 tCO 2-eq
per ton of glass, and 0.6–2.6 tCO 2-eqper ton of metal. Only the glass had values below the reference
values. Comparing these results with the paper of King and Gutberlet [ 25], the Cooperpires cooperative
contributed to a reduction of 1443–2720 tCO 2-eq, of which approximately 276 tCO 2-eqwas avoided
through recycling, and around 1277–2444 tCO 2-eqby the diversion of paper and cardboard.
