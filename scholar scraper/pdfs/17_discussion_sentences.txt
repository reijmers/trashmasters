Based  on  the  above  ﬁndings  we  introduce  the  term
‘forgotten  plastics’  for  non-household  end-use  plastic.
Generally,  industrial  actors  and  some  policy  makers  are
well  aware  that  these  waste  streams  exist,  yet  these
potentially  highly  recyclable  plastics  typically  disappear
in  the  overall  waste  statistics  and  consequently,  policies,
and  scientiﬁc  research  does  not  address  it  separately,  also
caused  by  the  lack  of  data
