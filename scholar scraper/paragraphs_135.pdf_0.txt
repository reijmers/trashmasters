crossmark data the economy that runs on waste accumulation in the circular city federico savini department of geography planning and international development studies university of amsterdam amsterdam netherlands abstract conventional wisdom holds that the circular economy will provide a sustainable pathway to economic growth advocates of circularity insist that maintainingeconomic growth while simultaneously reducing both inputs of materials and outputs of waste entails closing material streams in cities this article examines the roots and legacy of these prescriptions in environmental policymaking it argues that the circular economy represents a regime of ecoaccumulation in which waste is main resource of production and consumption focusing on the legacy of circulareconomy policies in the netherlands and amsterdam the article provides an account of the building of a nationwide greengrowth urban agenda underpinned by the valorization of waste it dissects three social economic and institutional processes and factors through which circularity takes shape a the recon guration of the multilevel structure through which waste processing has been governed b the promotion of a cityregional economy of micrologistics and industrial manufacturing for waste materials and c the centrality of households in producing and consuming waste in the urban environment the article

questioning the circular economy across a variety of socioeconomic sectors policy makers corporations and environmental groups are increas ingly putting forward notions of circular economyor just circularity these notions indicate a variegated set of practices for transitioning towards a sustainable socioeconomic system common examples include thereuse of organic waste such as biomass or biogas innovative product design to facilitate recycling integratedheat infrastructure in both industrial and residential building construction acquathermie in residential areas repair cafs in urban neighborhoods or digital sharing platforms reike vermeulen witjes an inspirational and abstract concept the circular economy is most clearly de ned in opposition to the linear economy based on a makeusedispose consumption paradigm environmental economists stress that a cir cular economy o ers a pathway to a postextractivist society in which the material demands of economic growth are

infrastructural and commercial realizations or the micropractices of sharing living and waste reuse among households as hobson and lynch write frameworks for and analysis of the ce circular economy

argued that circular economy mobilizes initiatives promoting social reciprocity ecologicallyresponsible consumerism product sharing and ecomanufacturing in cityregions girardet while underscoring the inadequacy of existing de nitions of circularity in urban planning others praise the idea s potential for addressing the problems of resource scarcity waste and ecosystem services williams critical works de ne circularity as the latest and most sophisticated version of the sustainable fetishized com modity valenzuela bhm p finally others dismiss circularity as a bundle of ideas that mobilizes a new morality of ecologicallyoriented economic consumption and production gregson crangfuller holmes p although these works have begun to question the sociospatial implications of circularity for society and urban areas they do so only to reconceptualize the circular economy we lack therefore evidencebased account explaining why and how this notion has been mobilized in environ mental governance toll this gap this article takes a macroperspective of the circular economy shedding light on the concept s roots and legacy in national and local sustainable development programs in so doing it contends that the circular economy marks the beginning of the capitalist economy s structural adaptation to problems of waste accumulation and resource scarcity it shows how the concept is driving a nationwide strategy to valorize waste as a resource for cityregional growth mobilizing the concept of regimes of accumulation the article hones in on three processes the changing multilevel governance of waste processing the expanding market for material and waste logistics in cityregions the centrality of households in producing and consuming urban waste material the article concludes by considering the risks of constructing a paradigm for green economic growth based on waste recovery the article results from research carried out in the netherlands in and focusing on the amster dam cityregion see methodological appendix for details the dutch context represents an extreme case of circular economy policy application in which the term is increasingly used across a di use constellation of ocial policy papers agreements studies and programmatic governmental papers in di erent sectors further more the notion of the circular economy is centrally prominent in the current governmental debate about theclimate act which is discussed below especially in relation to sustainability programs since both nationally and locally elected o cials industrial rms in logistics marketing data processing food and agriculture water management and other areas banking institutions and environmental advocacy groups have embracedcircularity incorporating it in their policies and visions at the time of writing all of the political parties in theamsterdam city council present circularity as a viable approach to sustainable growth eurocities because amsterdam is exceptional in the discourse of circularity the following analysis refrains from makinggeneral claims instead the study s purpose is to trace the genealogy of a policy idea and unpack its key social economic and institutional processes in the rst section i build on work in urban political ecology to sketch out the changing position of waste in both modern capitalism in general and existing forms of environmental governance in particular in the second f saviniand third section i unpack three key processes that explain waste s shifting role in circular economy policies i then focus on the roots and legacy of circular economy policymaking in the netherlands and amsterdam in so doing i show how this idea conveys an accumulation regime that maintains economic growth while transition ing to nonfossil based energy production reducing imports of raw materials and promoting a material logis tics sector in cityregions finally i argue that these policies depend on a form of urban ecoentrepreneurialismin which waste is beauti ed and households become waste prosumers the marginality of waste in modern eco accumulation in modern capitalism waste has become a negativity gille of production and consumptionin this context it is posited as the political other of value gidwani reddy p the degree zero of value frow p or antivalue in the circulation of capital harvey from the perspective of economics writes gille waste is not merely uninteresting but is rendered explicitly invisible or is explained away in theories and models that somehow marginally relate to the topic of waste p as ghandy argues the disappearance of waste from any spatial social and economic relation was the constitutive illusion ofhygienist approaches to modern environmental planning gandy indeed much planning of modern cityregions betrays this need to displace production and consumption s unwanted residues cities depended on zoning schemes that separate residential areas from waste treatment plants such as land lls and incinerators the regulation of unwanted residual materials has been increasingly centralized in national governments thus rising above intermunicipal con icts over waste disposal when not incinerated or buried inert or hazardous waste is either displaced to the very edges of urban agglomerations or globally exported to the planet s waste lands urban waste tends to reemerge within the urban fabric only as stubborn reminders of modern waste displacement s shortcomings kaika swyngedouw p indeed waste has been largely marginal in modern economic production and consumption especially at cityregional levels of scale to explain waste s changing role in contemporary economic development i use the concept of regimes of accumulation a term developed by the regulation school for analyzing the reorganization of capitalism in socioeconomic crises a regime of accumulation is a historically and geographically contingent articulation of capitalist production and consumption processes regime are institutionalized through modes of regulation comprising multilayered set of institutions social norms values and laws which together valorize particular goods materials and practices over others jessop jessop brenner jones the term regime has been particularly e ective in critical studies of how economic growth articulates with principles of ecological development speci cally it provides a framework in which to analyze how ecological states reregulate the economy to integrate ecological priorities and economic development while gibbs three dimensions of regimes of accumulation are particularly relevant in studying waste in contemporary circular economic models first regimes can be identi ed by the scales or polity at which the production circulation and realization of value are regulated regimes of accumulation unwind through the rescaling ofthe state across geopolitical levels visible in how responsibilities governance networks and regulatory pre scriptions shift to di erent levels of government second regimes manifest in and through particular modalities of commodity production and circulation and particular distributions of value across social and market sectors they are de ned by shifting features of commodity markets in economic growth speci c combinations of com modi ed goods services and experiences third regimes are structured around distinctive compositions of productive capacity and social demand these are evident in the articulation of the statemarket system intended as an apparatus or machinery of governing and crucially the role of individuals in economic pro duction and consumption for an extensive analytical framework see boyer even after sustainability became central to international policy agendas waste was hardly accorded a cen tral role in production and consumption processes until very recently waste processing has remainedanchored in a management paradigm although this paradigm was especially important in setting environ mental quality standards it remained marginal in economic governance gregson et al waste accumu lation was increasingly politicized during the s when the european greenleft waged a waronwaste cooper anticonsumerist activists pointed out waste accumulation s negative environmentallyjournal of environmental policy planning harmful consequences following this european regulations against land lling pushed national governments to modernize waste management develop stateofthe art waste incinerators and strengthen waste diversion schemes to improve recycling waste became matter of interest for both rms operating in the waste processing sector especially incineration and recycling and zerowaste movements ghting against waste facilities as such gille in the early s european environmental agendas made waste an important target of ecomodernization and infrastructural investment to facilitate the capture of valuable materials and e ective recycling waste regulation mandated rigorous management hierarchies national governments progressively regionalized waste processing regional authorities or boards undertook policies that diverted waste from land ll and incineration at least in western europe see bulkeley watson hudson davoudi improving waste incineration technologies also allowed cityregional governments to control the environmental andhealth risks of wastetoenergy plans waste management begun to follow a selfsu ciency paradigm buclet godard as regions came to rely on a oligopolistic chain of waste recovery oecd the regio nalization and partial liberalization of waste management was unable to recon gure existing conceptions of waste in economic development recycled materials remained secondary to raw materials in addition hazar dous materials and heavy metals required complex processing in transnational circuits in other cases waste was targeted by illicit economies and transnational agreements

management d alisa armiero gregson crang the consolidation of sustainable growth agendas in the mids marked a change in the way cities dealt with resources especially energy however this hardly changed waste s position in green growth regimes european policies have addressed problems of co reduction energy e ciency in production housing and transport and responsible ecological consumerism machin the ecological regime of accumulation of the early builds upon the ambition of greening economic production sustaining rises in clean industryenvironmental innovation dependency on renewables decentered energy markets energy e ciency in prop erty development and energy labeling while jonas gibbs this regime was driven by a coalition of actors across realestate green political parties environmental activists creative industries hitech and automation explicitly this coalition combined energy e ciency with principles of smart growth bossuyt savini caprotti in this context citizens were posited as at least potentially responsible consumers eco ecient homeowners and environmentally concerned voters this historical overview has emphasized waste s marginality in the early forms of environmental and econ omic governance it was secondary to the immaterial economies of nance knowledge and hitech waste was also kept geographically separate from residential areas being processed in regional peripheries or transnationally the waste market largely remained a sector of public agencies with incineration and water companies operating at regional scale massarutto finally waste remained alien to domestic life and consumption households were involved only in separating glass paper plastic and in some european cities food for recycling waste valorization raw materials beyond recycling the contemporary popularity of circular economic models in sustainability agendas suggest emergent features of a regime of accumulation in which waste is treated as not an output to manage but a resource for economicdevelopment prototypes of circular production date to the late s when industrial manufacturing groups began investing in industrial symbiosis and e ective industrial design to set up an economically pro table material recovery process concerned with raw materials and energy supply these groups organized cradle tocradle infrastructural and design systems that transform one company s residuals into another s input residuals here might be wastewater residual heat and chemicals models of industrial synergy minimizethe costs of raw materials in existing production processes mcdonough braungart cost e ective symbiosis required proximate industrial plants while zoning separated waste reuse from residential areas these approaches precipitated more recent models of circular economy as such they mark a rede nition f saviniof waste s business value in which waste became a resource for further production lacy rutqvist pauli urbinati chiaroni chiesa the circular economy s rising popularity in environmental policymaking builds upon the di usion of these industrial approaches through the realm of environmental governance these business models prescribe a posi tivized waste management valenzuela bhm p which values waste s productive reuse as a resource across social economic and spatial policymaking this paradigm shift allows governments to tackle several problems simultaneously the rising scarcity and prices of raw materials the consequential decrease of industrial productivity and ever growing volumes of waste governments in europe are increasingly concerned with recycling s social economic and environmental limitations while national recycling rates have increased in europe between and recycling output remains a problem in many larger urban areas where an average of just of recyclablewaste is collected biprocri in comparison with the eu average of about in recycling rates in amsterdam rotterdam parisile de france and london remain low although cityregional governments are very concerned with the current state of solid waste recyclingthis has had little e ect on industrial productivity in addition waste recycling in cityregions has been unable to meet ambitious governmental climate targets despite urban agglomerations being a primaryfocus of these policy goals recycled materials are of lower quality have high environmental prescriptionsin the case of chemicals electronics and heavy metals and establishing the infrastructure required to pro duce them remains more expensive than importing raw materials in particular the recycling of construction and demolition waste the second source of waste after water is still largely underdeveloped in europe finally recycling requires the continuous enlargement of waste facilities and permanent energy input which produces emissions these present signi cant problems for cityregional governments especially con sidering that waste output in cityregions is increasing with the overall enlargement of the stock of products in the economy the amount of stuthat is produced imported and then wasted schmidt jh con sultants given recycling s limitations policymakers have begun experimenting with w asteasresource approaches primarily in northwestern europe where land lling has been progressively reduced in the mids wasteasresource approaches came to closely resemble current circular policymaking especially when applied to urban areas and household practices bulkeley et al these approaches addressed the limits of recy cling by regulating waste as a resource for urban communities in building of a sociocultural program of environmental stewardship they involved nongovernmental associations and households pollans p the state s role in this paradigm is to encourage individual households to engage directly in waste proces sing promoting a culture of responsible consumerism and reuse governmental concern with recycling rates and how urban areas and households manage waste are impor tant but ultimately insu cient factors in explaining why the circular economy has become a strategic target both nationally and internationally among both states and industrial groups today s policy programs are shaped by the need to address resource scarcity and maintain high productivity levels in digital services chem istry hitech and knowledge the increasing prices of the most important raw materials as de ned by the european commission indicate that the continent is approaching a critical tipping point after which key resources for the postindustrial economy will become increasingly scarce ec especially rare materials include magnesium used in transportation antimony used in batteries vanadium used by the building industry and in engines and platinum group metals which are essential for producing solar panels wind tur bines and ensuring energy e ciency more generally the prices of these rare materials have tripled between and these materials which are imported from other continents notably china are irreplaceable in the production of energy infrastructures smart transport networks automated systems and digital networksdigitalization automation and electri cation are strategic targets for climate programs at the eu level and depend on cities capacity to recover metals from existing ewaste ec these trends indicate the broad context of circular economic approaches as a socioeconomic program these approaches combine three aims to surpass recycling as an approach to waste processing and not simply improve it to develop a market for recovered materials and maintain productivity and as i go on to show tojournal of environmental policy planning address co reduction targets the following section dissects three sociospatial and economic processes that push towards these ambitions urban mining logistics and prosumption three distinctive processes characterize an accumulation regime dependent on waste recovery circular econ omy programs rede ne urban development as a process of generating not exploiting resources see raw orth building on early analysis of urban metabolisms cities are presented as networks of material streams in which one activity s waste becomes another s resource girardet kennedy pincetl bunje regenerative urbanism which encompasses design and economics belongs to a paradigm of social cultural and infrastructural change in which the built environment is a source of materials not their product these models apply the notion of upcycling waste materials that is their reuse before recycling to buildings and infrastructures girardet lyle such practices include neighborhood based composting urban agriculture textile remanufacturing dprinting using recycled plastics communityenergy trusts and food waste coops cities foundation urban mining translates regenerative urbanism principles into industrial practice it envisages an industry geared to recovering materials from anthropogenicactivities in urban agglomerations baccini brunner a key pillar of circular economic policymaking urban mining is regenerative urbanism s industrial counterpart chemical and metal sectors use it to recover materials that although present in cities are unlikely to be recycled metals are recovered from obsolete electricity networks and underground pipes while chemicals and concrete are recovered for use in the building andregional food industries prendeville cherim bocken both urban mining and regenerative design as i later argue suggest a rescaling of waste and resource governance from national and international to localscales they re ect a devolution of the governance of materials in cityregions implemented through nationalurban deals that allows cities to better control waste recovery collection and reuse a second distinctive process of an accumulation regime dependent on waste valorization is the shortening of supplychains that move materials recovered from waste historically the circulation of waste materials such as water domestic waste chemicals and metals has been fragmented andunbundled in postfordist urban ization graham marvin p this has made waste processing not only costly but also very uncom petitive relative to raw material imports urban waste processing was largely unpro table for regional companies davoudi sturzaker this resulted in a highly sectoral urban infrastructure paralleled by a variety of semiautonomous public private and semiprivate rms managing speci c material ows cir cular economic models target this inadequate waste supply chain which they suggest should be replaced by anexus infrastructure able to bridge di erent material streams artioli acuto mcarthur logistics is the prime sector advocating a networked infrastructure as a sector logistics governs distri bution processing and shipment in dense urban agglomerations in a market of mass consumption dependenton global supply chains freight and cargo logistics are crucially important hesse current circular econ omy models prescriptions a greater circulation of materials goods and waste speci cally within cityregions ranta aarikkastenroos ritala mkinen the ellen macarthur foundation a major advocate of circular economy in the corporate sector explicitly foreground reverse logistics logistics that connect con sumed goodswaste back to producers as a rationale for circular policymaking ellen macarthur foun dation such programs highlight potential business opportunities such as customized consumption supply chains local remanufacturing cityregional agriculture and bioeconomy they call for investments in the infrastructures necessary for distributing products in the circuits of sharing and secondhand economies mostly at the regional scale this kind of regionalization puts logistics rms already positioned in the material distribution sector in a pivotal governance position thus the transition towards circularity is enabled by investments in infrastructure that are primarily carried out by aircargo providers airports waste and water companies industrial consortia in chemistry freight transporters storage facilities providers and network providers as i show these rms are some of the main advocates of circular economy in the private and utility sector f savinithe third distinctive process of accumulation under the circular economy is the structural rearticulation of consumption and production processes in cities the rescaling of logistics markets characterizes a regime of accumulation in which one producer s wastes become another s inputs mathews p the notion of the prosumer captures this shift individuals are more than users or consumers they become makers of the resources needed for their own consumption practices humphreys grayson ritzer the pro sumer belongs to an economic system in which the two formerly distinct processes of production and con sumption temporally and spatially overlap ritzer dean jurgenson as such the concept has been fruitfully used to explain the role of users in the search engines industry as a material prosumer the individuals act of consuming a particular good such as a phone with its electronics or tshirt with its fabric pro duces the necessary conditions of that consumption in my example reusable electronic materials or textiles ashobson has suggested prosumption has both social and geographical dimensions the concept allows us to grasp the circular economy not exclusively as a technological or business program but rather as a socio cultural shift in consumerist society urban households and the consumption and lifestyle practices they involve actively partake in production processes prosumption is central to the rising commodi cation of waste according to which household consumption is necessary for the production of new market commodities which are distributed through systems of sharingplatforms repairing spaces remanufacturing sites fabrication ateliers and product redesign hult bradley p located in dense urban environments in close proximity with households these activities often use digital sharing technologies by engaging in sharing activities households become prosumers in an econ omy in which consumption equals production through waste prosumption encompasses a broad array of indi vidual practices sharing leftover meals collecting urines and feces containing phosphates for regional agriculture exchanging used clothes at nearby popup stores collecting organic waste to make compost for local neighborhood ethanol production sending obsolete appliances to nearby repair shops and manymore in the following sections i reconstruct the legacy of circular economic policy programs in the nether lands and amsterdam roots and legacy of a circular economy regime in the netherlands the dutch context o ers an ideal case to explore the institutional and political impacts of the circular economy model in contemporary european economies the netherlands above other european countries has under taken comprehensive policies at all scales explicitly combining climate targets with a national strategy for sus tainable growth these policies moreover are applied to a densely populated country in which urban agglomerations are expanding and energy raw materials and land are increasingly scarce since the dutch government has started producing programmatic and strategic documents aimed at implementing numerous circular economy interventions projects pilots and initiatives over the next yearsin the governmental program from waste to resource vang van afval naar grondsto marked a shift in the national waste processing paradigm and recognized how existing waste policy is targeted at mitigating the environmental stress of waste while a circular economy requires seeing waste as a resource my trans lation this comprehensive program developed by the ministry of infrastructures and environment com bines three strategic policy sectors that have previously been institutionally discrete the increasingly urgent need for resource selfsu ciency and e ective waste disposal a transition away from fossilbased energy sources and smart socioeconomic growth underpinned by ecoproduction and consumption the program proposes numerous interventions including pilot projects experimenting with new production and consump tion processes these projects aim to rede ne waste regulations institute nationallocal partnerships establish specialized rd for e cient product development in the food building and hitech sectors and develop a new consumer culture by promoting reuse and sharing projects at the neighborhood level the vang policy framework results from a series of parliamentary briefs and motions that appeared in national policy debates in and the interministerial resource note grondsto enotitie and more value out of waste note ministry of ienm signaled that the government s intended to valorize waste streams and broadly reorganize supply chains to achieve resource independence both documentsjournal of environmental policy planning point out at that existing recycling procedures are inadequate given expected waste increases especially household electronic and construction waste they highlight the importance of resource e ciency in nation ally strategic industries of hitech agribusiness logistics creative industry and construction these sectors are identi ed as especially crucial in the dutch economy in terms of both economic added value and job units however these sectors are also exposed to a high degree of risk in terms of raw materials supply for their materials are still primarily imported from abroad these political agreements represent stepping stones towards a national vision on the circular economy they cut against an excessively international resourcewaste cycle which depends on global markets and fragmented logistics but also responded to changing national waste streams in a postindustrial economy in the netherlands consumergenerated waste is increasing and producergenerated waste is decreasing between and in light of the country s steady increase of gdp household waste increased by while indus trial waste decreased by the metal and food industries producing still most waste figure early dutch circular economy policy briefs then combined the urgent need to grapple with both resource scarcity andincreasing consumption waste in the netherlands most primary materials are employed in the food of all materials used in the sector construction and metal industries cbs data from these materials are not provided through traditional recycling techniques and must be processed through materialspeci c recovery systems composted or back lled although the vang program had little e ect on recycling rates rivm it activates numerous initiat ives across di erent sectors today these constitute the policy network that has driven the fast positioning of the circular economy in national and local political agendas in these initiatives were streamlined as part ofa nationwide circular economy program called the netherlands circular in ministry of infrastructure and environment structured around vetask forces this program s organizes multilevel governance around initiatives in the biomassfood remanufacturing consumption and building sectors the initiativesinclude adjusting packaging regulations and producer responsibility establishing data exchange platforms that promote the material recovery before recycling in the areas of resource design and product development for example circo business design and platform circular entrepreneurs educating children about waste s importance in

streams whether of food energy chemical renewables or wastewater in existing harbors areas these initiatives are carried out through intersectoral and multilevel contracts among public governments startups in the product design and energy sectors and industrial groups in the hitech and energy sectors suchas philips shell and energy distributors since the dutch government has been developing a multilevelcrosssectoral governance strategy geared towards experimenting with innovative projects in urban agglomera tions it has signed a total of green deals and citydeals contracts for schemes trying out innovative solutions for green economic growth among these deals address the circular economy waste reuse inte grating material streams and developing a biobased economy in building nationalurbanbusiness coalitions around these issues the deals combine approaches to supply chain management business modeling and urban infrastructuration ganzevles potting hanemaaijer they create a form of waste governance that is more decentralized and multisectoral than previously they also include partnerships with several environ mental associations alongside promises of new certi cation systems and subsidies that disincentive incinera tion these deals are particularly oriented to establish partnerships between startups in data and freight logistics urban waste departments and infrastructural providers this expansion of policy initiatives has now been fully institutionalized in the governmental policy package on climate the socalled climate agreement klimaatakkord i sarst attempt at streamlining all the national policies necessary for achieving the target of reducing co emissions by in comparison to the s by the circular economy gures as a strategic priority in three key areas the reduction of co in the country s growing building industry the shift from fossilbased to biomass and biogas energy sources and the reduction ofall primary raw materials used in the economy by dutch government the task force circular economy one among groups designing the program is elaborating strategies to increase food and organic waste reuse for biomass and biogas its key members are national chemical electronic and building rms which mean to invest in a biobased economy for electronics and chemicals taskforce biomass and food under the name urban mining collective these rms are forming a national advocacy coalition which aims to promote the recovery not recycling of construction residuals metals ewaste and chemicals a major challenge faced by the netherlands in reducing its co production is the creation of a biobased economy dependent on biomass and biogas such an economy would address the country s dependence on gas gas covers about of all energy supply in the netherlands produces of all co and provides heat ing for of the country s total housing stock renewables constitute only of total supply the govern mental strategy for realizing a circular economy in achieving its climate targets has to be placed in the context ofan energy transition in which renewable energies do not adequately meet current energy demands the circulareconomy would substitute the country s largest energy source ground gas with another waste above all organic waste together the netherlands small but stable share of renewable energy high ratios of and capacity for incineration and high volumes of organic waste from cities and agribusiness has combined tomake valorizingorganic waste a national target data from cbs pbl rivm wur urban logistics as market for the circular economy in rede ning waste processing procedures regulations and infrastructures these national programs require direct involvement from cityregional governments and waste processing rms the national agreements described above consolidate a multilevel governance structure focused on valorizing waste streams fromand within urban environments it does so by strengthening and developing niche markets for di erent sorts of waste management processing and collection the city of amsterdam formed a pioneering policy network including national programs visions agree ments and strategies for the circular economy since governing political parties in the municipal execu tive formed a green growth coalition around early principles of circularity this coalition addressed regional growth by tackling the e ects of the global nancial crisis on the city srealeconomy namely the building food and logistic sectors the parties agreed an agenda that experimented with combining principles

privatized as municipallyowned companiesthese are the harbor company havenbedrijf which manages the harbor industrial area and its underground infrastructure and the waste and energy company afval

sustainability these proposalsidentify areas prime for industrial redevelopment in the amsterdam region and propose building new logistic hubs in the city s periphery changing consumptionproduction practices prosumption of waste in amsterdam the spatial separation of sites where waste is generated residential and commercial spaces and those where waste is processed land ll incinerators and recycling plants is the structural result of a particular socioecon omic system in which waste materials occupied a negative position as dirt or externality in both consump tion and production processes in the accumulation regime of the circular economy by contrast waste becomesa commodity that is produced and consumed within the city in a consumerist economy the household is the prime site at which goods are consumed waste generated and raw materials recovered the prosumption of waste occurs through an increased proximity between those sites at which waste is generated through consump tion and those at which it is recovered through processing i use the notion of prosumption to capture urbandwellers and consumers shifting position in justi cations of the circular economy as a model of cityregional economic growth circular economy programs in the netherlands and amsterdam began from two distinct but complementary directions as i have described above the national government has been producing programmatic documents about how the circular economy might address waste increase and resource dependency within its climate ambi tions at a local level amsterdam o cials have been prototyping projects experimenting with closedloop neigh borhood infrastructures regional supply chains and new waste and material cultures since mids the rst uses of circularity in urban policy date back to the redevelopment of the buiksloterham area a mixed housingindustrial district adjoining amsterdam s central station epitomized as a circular living lab the area became a benchmark project for circularity initiatives due to its peculiar mix of residential redevelopment and industrial activities in remanufacturing and design savini dembski having sketched the rst plans for developing the underused shipyard the project s proponents a community of ecoactivists urban dwellers and designers built their houses from reused materials and established a closedloop infrastructural system for water compostand energy the initiative s leaders organized a community around principles of housing ecoe ciency ecocon sumption and sustainable lifestyles they experimented with decentered wastewater treatment o grid energy circles and organic waste composting building on the success of these initiatives in the city governmentbegan redeveloping a sqm plot in collaboration with homeowners housing corporations and energy and water companies to experiment with closedloop material streams in this neighborhood developers arenow testing new types of inhouse sewage ltering and composting this socalled project city plot became the benchmarking prototype for the circular vision of the city at large indeed it is the only concrete exampleof circular neighborhood in the amsterdam circular document it involved devising an integrated neighborhood in which organic waste feeds energy and urban gardening locally grown products could be purchase with local currencies solar energy is stored and reused and wastewater is used to store heat in these plans for circular living households are portrayed as more than consumers of energy e cient hous ing they are also producers of resources such as energy water hating compost and buildings this positioning of citizens is found across circular microprojects in amsterdam a broad landscape of citizenbased micro businesses and startups active in a green repurposing repairing reusing remanufacturing and redesigning industry amsterdam s circular economy is anchored in the growing hype surrounding the city s socalled makers industry ormakers movement ad iuse network of startups involved in customized diy production digitalized manufacturing and ecoconscious consumerism morozov this sector which expanded during a period of realestate downturn combines startup redevelopment with a subculture of ecological entrepreneurialism that explicitly targets surplus materials wasted products and local production in journal of environmental policy planning of all amsterdam rms were in the handicraft market of which produced art and consumable pro ducts such as trinkets ornaments accessories parts clothes etc most importantly this was the city s fastest growing sector during the recent period of economic crisis with growth rates of relative to the national rate of this prosperity is largely concentrated in the region s inner core municipality of amsterdam the policy framework for this local commercial sector was labeled amsterdam made emphasizing a vital local manufacturing and material reuse economy this label became central in a public campaign promoting best practices in ecomanufacture which including tenders for innovative startups in material reuse such as the dam prize for circular businesses or the circo the nationwide design program for microbusiness intextile repurposing these policy prototypes engage households in circular projects that include waste products that can be e ec tively managed by dwellers such as paper plastic textiles diapers and small metal items logistics chemicaland waste industries are also starting to invest in processing these materials by building close links with con sumers an example is the partnership between the amsterdam incinerator procter gamble and the small rm fater which reuses materials from used diapers as collected by citizens in separate public bins embrace similarly the wasted project in amsterdam north which though initiated by a startup is now sponsored by the northern district government requires that households monitor their paper and plasticwaste and use smart bins to obtain local currency these activities are having a visible impact on amsterdamrecent circular plans include a new wastetoresource hub in the same district here material separation tech niques repair cafs redesign studios and secondhand markets will be sited together the underlying ambi tion of these policies is to connect the macro scale of waste processing economies eg the recycling of metals orplastic with the circuits of consumption and smallscale production by households and companies in urban areas as the amsterdam o cial states during an interview the ideal situation is to combine the old school industry or recycling businesses with initiatives that get a grip with the urban material streams the large companies waste building and logistic are getting closer to the laptops of the sharing plat forms the consumers in the city the aim is to connect these two sectors that today are still apart this microindustry of waste production and consumption also has social cultural and aesthetic dimen sions it prospers from the beauti cation of waste a process in which the residue consumerism is portrayed as not only manageable and pro table but beautiful and ecologically desirable too the initiatives mentioned above make extensive use of public campaigns which promote waste s positive aspects among urban dwellers the city is also becoming the stage for the visual valorization of waste in october amsterdam city council hosted an exhibition named circular expo which was about circular design and material reuse for its part waag society a major cultural institution in the city has organized interactive urban mining workshops and d printing workshops featuring recycled plastic today the waag society remains at the forefront of the cir cular debate in amsterdam in rotterdam the boijmans museum schange the system exhibition featured works created entirely from plastic artistic artifacts made from waste are also found in amsterdam which sports fatberg an island of residual fat oating in the sea these are more than artistic gestures they highlight how circularity is being embedded in urban culture these are just few among numerous examples of urban practices that build productive relations among urban dwellers and waste they also suggest that the beauti cation of waste provides a crucial backdrop against which waste is valorized in the circular economy the signi cance of the sociocultural dimension of circularity lies in how it reveals the potential as opposed to the danger of discarded materials at one level the artistic display of garbage provides allegories for the environmental social and political problems on the planet lind ner meissner p at another waste s beauti cation has come to justify its value within the circular economy waste is paradoxically presented as a solution to the problem of overconsumption not its cause questioning the nature of the circular economy this article has developed an encompassing account of the circular economy to explain why this notion hasdiused so widely in environmental governance and policymaking deliberately refrained from theoretically f saviniredening this volatile term it has focused instead on questioning how circularity has been mobilized in environ mental governance over the last decade in doing so it has sought to explain the underlying social economic and political drivers that are making the circular economy a policy hype across europe there is a broad agreement among european national and local government o cialsas well as environmental activists environmental scholars and industrial rms in various sectors that a circular mode of development in which all anthropo genic waste is reused in new activities might o er an alternative and achievable pathway to a sustainable econ omy this agreement is grounded on the assumption that a system valorizing waste as a resource will allow a particular region or country s economy to reduce the import and extraction of raw materials and energy to almost zero circularity involves reorganizing consumption and production to build a waste processing and recovery market that includes a large array of interventions common examples include the increasing incineration of bio mass reuse of nutrients in the regional agricultural economy reuse of light metals in cable production promotion of digital platforms for sharing production and extraction of energy from wastewater this article has taken the circular economy s new centrality in policymaking as the symptom of an emergent regime of capitalist accumulation that prospers by valorizing waste it dissected the underlying processes bywhich waste is valorized in regional and national economies honing in on the netherlands and amsterdam it has shown how the governmental need to recover material waste close to its source gave rise to early proto types of circular economic policymaking this occurred through three processes rst a combined governmen tal and business concern with waste accumulation and raw material scarcity in a growing postindustrial consumption economy states are seeking systemic approaches to meet demands for raw materials and simul taneously rethink the modern paradigm of waste disposal and recycling which is failing to cope with increasingwaste stock and relatively low recycling rates especially in urban agglomerations circular economy provides an approach to economic development that makes one problem the solution of the other in a sustainable way this is particularly evident in how biomass and biogas are now used to justify the value of organic waste as a longterm source of green energy and biobased raw materials second the circular economy builds on existing attempts to rejuvenate and redevelop cityregional logistics markets in the materials and goods transportation sector processing and storage has not fared well in the transition beyond fossil fuels putting harbors airports and other urban logistics hubs at the forefront of a circular transition in this context the adaptation of the logistics sector which is actively seeking ecoe ciency has become a key target in national approaches to the circular economy as such the logistics sector is both the driver and target of circular economic policymaking finally a regime of accumulation based on waste valorization builds on a particular social and cultural articulation of production and consumption processes the popularity of circular economic policymakinghas risen in parallel with a culture of ecological production and consumption in which households circulate and reuse potential waste materials the notion of prosumption captures households emerging role in a new economy of materials which is centrally important in closing urban chains of waste supply and demand through consumption households are both producers of waste and consumers of reprocessed waste materials which are revalued as new recycled or upcycled commodities they do so through practices of buying dis carding separating repairing sharing collecting and repurposing consumable goods this article has not argued that a new capitalist accumulation regime is now fully edged and instantiated neither it has questioned the urgency and virtue of the core principle of circularity the reuse of all waste thatmight possibly be produced it has aimed instead to pinpoint the policy processes through which waste materialshave acquired a new centrality in sustainable economic thinking it has shown how current realizations of the circular economy are not concerned with reducing waste through progressive anticonsumerist policies current policy packages are a far cry from the radical principles of the circular economy s earliest applications as jackson emphasized years before the circular economy became a widely recognized model any dematerialization of the economy through circularity should prioritize demandside interventions oriented towards reducing consumption in a rst place such interventions include both promoting an explicit anticonsumerist culture in households and truepricing regulations in production current policy practice in contrast posits waste as the wellspring of economic production and consumption a source of materials a posteriori justi ed as a strategy for meeting climate targets in a growing postindustrial economy these policies indicate the limits of anjournal of environmental policy planning approach to circularity that is supposed to bring about a fundamental transition towards a dematerialized econ omy instead they justify a vicious codependency in which waste accumulation and materialenergy supplybypasses the more fundamental source of ecological problems evergrowing consumer capitalism notes waste had a di erent position in premodern societies in whose urban economies and living spaces it was more central and visible a further example of waste s economic marginality is the fact that economic and statistical accounting of waste has been fragmented until very recently in the early s integrated systems of environmental economic accounting were estab lished along with lifecycle assessment tools and detailed categorizations which discriminated for instance waste from residue oremission  see also

vicepresident of unilever  the netherlands has a very high incineration capacity in europe with amsterdam being one of the largest incineration plants on the continent the country imports waste from abroad and biomass from other continents too moreover in waste incineration was labelled a useful use of waste the share of organic waste burned in amsterdam is about paradoxically this makes incineration a useful and sustainable mode of managing waste one of the very rst appearances of the term circular economy was at the event organized by the centralconservative party cdu on october at the tolhuistuin here the party s sustainability advisor and brie y parliamentary member marieke van der werf was invited to present the cradletocradle concept for the future of the city economy the

greenbizz incubator promoted by regional program for circular economy in bruxelles the large halle repair caf in hamburg or the upcycle city contest in almere just next to amsterdam interview with
