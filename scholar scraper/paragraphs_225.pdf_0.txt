springer nature switzerland ag ml francogarca et al eds towards zero waste greening of industry networks studies  the future of circular economy and zero waste maralaura francogarca jorge carlos carpioaguilar and hans bressers abstract this chapter provides a reflective analysis of the contributions focusing on how the chapters contribute to circular economy in two main themes that will define the future of circular economy research challenges and opportunities and effective collaboration with stakeholders lessons learned and commonalities are also discussed to finally draw some conclusions and recommendations to further elaborate the research agenda of this field keywords circular economy collaboration with stakeholders zero waste countryspecific challenges and opportunities one of the lessons from the chapters is that challenges and opportunities have been so far somewhat generically described in the literature which tends to assume a universal view of challenges and opportunities where the lessons from developed countries can be without a problem translated to developing countries we argue that a more contingent approach is needed taking into account deep structural institutional and cultural differences between countries in other words our under standing of circular economy ce challenges and opportunities needs to be geo graphically and socially embedded to understand countryspecific differences accordingly in chap dieleman and martnez analysed opportunities and chal lenges of ce in mexico from a wide systemic perspective inspired by the concept of national innovation systems and its emphasis on distinctiveness of contextual conditions to frame their discussion they used the components of such concept ie i market trends and conditions ii competitiveness and productivity iii ml francogarca h bressers university of twente enschede the netherlands email mlfrancogarciautwentenl jtabressersutwentenl j c carpioaguilar walmart mexico cdmx

longterm market trends in the country are positive iii the regula tory framework through the countrys national development plan aims at stimulat ing green growth iv since the s environmental education nationally exists as well as knowledge transfer systems v mexicans openness to new technology induced practices in contract serious challenges are also mentioned i markets are not flexible and there is lack of bank credits allocation in the long term ii a culture that restricts innovation and creativity and a desire to shape and control the future leaves mexico with poor seizing opportunities iiiiv discrepancy between the creation and execution of policy and the environmental education plan is another real challenge v the needed rather experimental and learningbydoing educa tional approach to address ce shows limitations of the current mexican learning culture the authors emphasised this last element because it influences how the economy and society function and therefore represents one of the biggest chal lenges to overcome in particular within the waste sector in chap ghinea and gavrilescu analysed the romanian waste management policy framework and practices to identify chal lenges and opportunities of ce goals as a result they suggested strategic solutions for integrated waste management and policies for its improvement with the help of the life cycle assessment methodology eight waste management scenarios were assessed the first one was used as baseline collection transportation and landfill ing for the comparison with seven hypothetical scenarios which are constructed following the principles of lansinks ladder as mentioned in chap lansinks ladder emphasises the relevance of preventing waste generation during its management the best scenario according to the environmental categories of the lca methodology was the scenario that integrates separate collection by waste streams recycling of those materials composting of organic waste and incineration of the residual waste seeking for possibilities to embed ce at the country level cruzpastrana and francogarca in chap explored the feasibility to implement a capandtrade sys tem cts to mitigate climate change effects which has been widely applied in other countries but not in mexico in such context ce can offer additional possibili ties to embrace cts generating both environmental and economic benefits hence the purpose of this chapter was to explore the cts feasibility in mexico and to highlight the implications of considering ce models into a capandtrade instru ment approaching this intention by using macc marginal abatement cost curves of all the measures to reduce ghg with negative cost agglomerates could contribute almost to the gdp by based on macc calculations the chap ter argued that cts is potentially feasible in mexico even further as the attached carbon price by endusers might be a strong motivation to integrate ce tenets to their operations bringing new innovative opportunities to close materials and energy loops ml francogarca et al stakeholders moving forward the rest of the papers in this volume were introduced by following the stakeholder structure which was outlined in chap we started with papers that clearly showed the public sector as one of the most influential stakeholders in par ticular when it concerns the household solid waste management which is the focus of chaps and in the case of chap a governmental programme to stimulate the urban symbiosis recycling implementation in china was the core of the analysis whilst in chap the indonesian higher education management was the focus education being one of the public sectors responsibilities universities were discussed as the intellectual cradle for the transition from linear to circular economy trends stakeholder promoter public sector it is not a coincidence that the authors suherman et al of chap elaborated their case under the stakeholder identity and salience framework for their analysis of the household solid waste management in cimahi city indonesia in effect the theory of stakeholder identity and salience by mitchell et al is the core analytical tool applied to this indonesian case that to some extent reflects the current situation of the majority of cities in the country authors have a double interest whilst con ducting this research the first one is to approach systematically the identification and classification of the stakeholders involved in the household solid waste manage ment in cimahi city and secondly to detect the specific stakeholders who would be entitled to lead the transition towards circularity patterns of the solid waste manage ment moreover collaborative schemes for such transition can be discussed and designed by engaging those salient stakeholders as one of the main findings of this research it proved possible to identify and classify the stakeholders in cimahi city for the household waste management into two meaningful categories i the formal sector government ngos and private ones and the ii informal sector not offi cially registered waste collectors and recycling entities daz and tinococastrejn presented in chap the efforts of the government of cuautlancingo puebla mexico to transit the urban solid waste management towards circular economic practices they interviewed governmental stakeholders to diagnose the current practices that resemble those of ce and validated such infor mation through either secondary information sources or interviewing other stake holders who were to some extent directly involved in the waste management based on the evidence the authors showed that in spite of the municipal efforts to provide proper waste collection and disposal services the urban solid waste management in cuautlancingo is lagging behind when comparing it with what circular economy promotes there is a consensus among stakeholders that the more discharged mate rials during production and postconsumption can be recycled within companies a the future of circular economy and zero waste higher productivity level of the municipality can be achieved because this means a reduction of the materials to be treated or disposed by municipalities the use of indicators to boost circular economy practices is suggested such as the resource consumption rate per capita rates of segregated and recycled materials and rates of waste used for energy recovery additionally local government is recommended to formulate regulations and policies in order to ensure the environmental care and responsible acting of the citizens this should be integrated with awareness cam paigns about waste management opportunities for the community openness for collaboration with other stakeholders was enthusiastically mentioned whilst talking to governmental officers chapter entitled a massive urban symbiosis a preliminary review of the urban mining pilot bases initiative in china written by xue et al aims to bring the chinese urban mining pilot base umpb case under the light of the governance assessment tool bressers et al the research question driving this work is what are the typical features as a massive urban symbiosis policy that the chinese urban mining pilot base umpb programme represents and to what extent can they be improved the umpb is a chinese governmental initiative to stimulate recy cling of key materials as the main urban symbiosis activity that links efficient mate rial flows between production and consumption the industry sector and the urban sector the urban symbiosis a concept derived from industrial symbiosis is also in china framed under the ce policy and has been embedded into chinas urban min ing pilot base umpb programme that promotes the growth of the recycling indus try and the use and development of advanced technology to cope with highvalue recycling practices the current pilot bases with a planned billion tonnes per year capacity indicates that a massive urban symbiosis effort is taking place in china moreover this paper shows that the driving force of waste recycling man agement in china is moving from an environmental and recycling angle to resource strategies despite umpbs legal and subsidies assurance this does not reflect the creation of a perfect governance context for its implementation on the contrary some incoherencies and policy conflicts were detected at the multiministerial crossmanagement network who are the actual umpb implementers those repre sent some of the main barriers challenges for this programme in chap incorporating circular sustainability principles in dki jakarta lessons learned from dutch business schools management nurdiana et al ana lysed the experiences of the integration of circular economy into the dutch high education curricula with the purpose of using them as reference for the indonesian higher education system the authors identified the need to expand the concept of green university to the broader concept of ce this is due to the important role universities play in societies forming capacities to face current and future societal challenges especially those oriented to cope with resource scarcity and pollution effects as part of the findings in indonesia it can be mentioned here that the indonesian universities have a relatively narrow view whilst the dutch cases anal ysed present a more holistic approach towards sustainability and ce offering them some extra manoeuvre opportunities for the inclusion of ce education ml francogarca et al stakeholder promoter private sector the internationally operating supermarket chain walmart in its mexico operations has identified food waste as a niche for improvement as described in chap where the concept of zero waste to landfill zwtl was explored with the intention to ameliorate the organic waste management zwtl pursues prevention and reduction of wastes at their source of generation which effects are in line with ce principles in fact rincnmoreno et al suggest that circularity would increase productivity throughout the food supply chain if it became part of the business strategy in order to test this a showcase was selected to explore how the organic waste management can be improved by combining a ce business model and a zwtl strategy after analysing the data of the organic composition of the wastes from the show case the authors elaborated upon the idea that most of the food considered as waste can be recovered through different stages even further of the food waste manage ment costs can be saved through three business actions associated with those recov ery stages the proposed framework intends to collect all the sustainable concepts that might potentially be resembled in other industries with similar challenges the findings showed that most of the food which is considered waste discharged organic products can be recovered through different operations within the shop facilities inventory management first expiredfirst out donations livestock feed and a biodi gester to generate electricity the biodigester represents the most important invest ment though of the food waste management costs can be saved through three of the business actions associated to those recovery stages through the conduction of this project a combined framework solfoodwaste is elaborated and discussed the petstar pet bottletobottle recycling system a zerowaste circular econ omy business model was presented in chap cmaracreixell and scheel mayenberger emphasised the point of finding ways to organise the pet bottles postconsumption enabling petstar to successfully contribute to the plastic recy cling industry participation of three stakeholders involved in the industry the environment society and business requires a different business model in which all actors can participate and produce a more inclusive added value this is mentioned in reflection on the scavengers conditions as an important stakeholder in the pet bottle recycling value chain scavengers mostly operate informally resulting in their exclusion from traditional business models at this regard petstar is a com pany that has designed and implemented a circular economy business model for pet bottles that is trying to achieve a dream for the recycling industry ie to disen gage the recycled bottle from virgin resources avoiding the conversion of the pack aging to waste and operate a perennial cycle in the use of the packaging this case disclosed how their business model is operated in a sustainable way economically feasible and competitive whilst environmentally resilient and socially oriented towards the poorest and most informal sectors the scavenger and collector com munities even beyond their own market boundaries there is a strong belief that conditions can be created to enable replicability of their model of sustainable the future of circular economy and zero waste recycling to other developing countries where the potential of zerowaste circular value systems is well perceived by a large number of stakeholders in the pet bottle value chain in chap the concepts of social life cycle assessment slca and combined social and environmental lca selca were explored through the application of existing lca methods to the global value chain of denim jeans francogarca et al reported on the selca method from this explorative research the inclusion of the social component into the assessment of the denim jeans showcase contributes to the battery of impact assessment tools for products whose value chain scope is mul tinational global four scenarios for jeans assembly were compared three of them are defined under the circular economy ce principles by including recycled mate rials cotton pet and nylon during the yarn production during the application of the selca method some new challenges were encountered related to inventory analysis in particular during data acquisition for social inventories this last aspect is mainly due to the extensive list of key stakeholders for the showcase and the qualitative nature of the social metrics used the list starts with cotton cultivators from different countries where regulations and codes of conduct seem to have con textualised interpretations and consequently different levels of implementation in this regard governmental intervention to instrument the transition towards suitable socialenvironmental performance along the global jeans value chain was also dis cussed in this paper stakeholder promoter civil society plasenciavlez et al presented chap a circular model of residential composting in mexico state this is the description of a composting project led by a civil society group within the physical borders of a residential unit nearby mexico city they produce compost from their own organic wastes closing the loop by creating a product that nourish inner gardens of their residential area the authors provided an indepth description of their case arguing that their research contributes to the ce studies in particular addressing the participation of households and by this showing that ce practices can be promoted by anyone who perceives the potential of discharged materials to be reintegrated into the natural biological cycle the mexican urban solid waste usw has a high organic component that can be potentially recovered and transformed as the households of club de golf bellavista showed in this research for the authors this is a grassroots example with positive effects on the usw management hence with the intention to deploy its potential at a larger scale the purpose of this research was to identify the neces sary conditions for this type of projects to be successful therefore it is important to identify and analyse similar cases in order to learn from the existing best prac tices looking beyond the borders british and dutch cases are also analysed through an analytical framework constructed from specialised literature it is used to assess the case in mexico state by the means of surveys and semistructured ml francogarca et al interviews among the most relevant findings social participation came consis tently across as a relevant success factor in this type of grassroots initiatives additionally promoters of this case gave suggestions about ways to engage the other neighbours in the separation phase of usw concluding overview and suggestions for future research the ellen macarthur foundation sun and mckinsey have estimated that by adopting circular economy principles europe can create a net benefit of trillion by or trillion more than in the current linear development path certainly it is much easier to calculate monetary benefits than to implement the necessary instruments to transit to a more circular economy through the current complexity of value chains the transition needs to involve product designers busi ness developers investors marketers managers consumers and every single person of the society who has to deal with any type of discharged resources waste and can still see its value as a resource more importantly stakeholders are needed to bring the resources back to any of the closed material resources loops to avoid landfill ing to its maximum expression zero waste this implies full systemic change and innovation at different levels technological organisational social financial and policy level it is though expected that even in a highly ce scenario there will remain some elements of linearity as virgin resources are required and ultimate residual materials are disposed of some technological challenges stem from the current waste treatment facilities such as incinerators that do not fit within the ce principles to deal with that some countries eg the netherlands have considered a midterm plan to gradually transform lowefficient incinerators into specialised recycling and reuse facilities also relevant is the growing movement of critical thinktanks to further develop new paradigms to practise the ce tenets the number of approaches and business models to be considered grows constantly due to the sense of urgency produced by the foreseen beneficial potential of ce cramer for instance has reported nine circularity schemes which at the same time imply the integration of related business models here is the list of her rs i refuse prevent the use of resources ii reduce decrease the use of resources iii reuse find new product use second hand iv repair maintain and repair v refurbish improve product vi remanu facture create new products from second hand vii repurpose reuse product for different purposes viii recycle reuse raw materials of product and ix recover recover energy from waste historically the practice of the rs has been observed at a small and individual scale but the real challenge is to scale them up into collaborative platforms where resource flows create value and close the production loops into a zerowaste system the businesses that have invested in innovations like new material recovery methods the future of circular economy and zero waste and material substitution are expected to play a leading role on this because they have an influential position within their networks and stakeholders on the other hand the efforts of the private sector require the support of policy instruments and the consumer participation as it was repeatedly mentioned in the cases here presented to sum up the following reported barriers can be turned into the focus of further research along the ongoing ce implementation institutional barriers posed by existing business models organisational barriers as a result of poorly coordi nated efforts legal barriers hampering innovation to some extent economic barriers that focus on current business models behavioural barriers to change consumers attitudes environmental commitments associated to local and inter national agreements and technological barriers that prevent incremental innovations with no doubt technological innovations are a must in the transition towards ce but it can also be argued that innovation is not always the panacea when the endof life of some materials represents a barrier by itself or not all the materials might be improved or substituted hence in some cases producers have to compromise the toxicity level of some ingredients in the formulation of their products simply because they cannot sacrifice the product quality in other cases producers have important suppliers who cannot be replaced or do not agree to provide information on their materials a way to overcome the reluctance to open up the flux of informa tion could be by a suitable policy mix that regulates the transparency of information andor stimulates purchasing circular products in regard to the local and international environmental agreements eg green house emission reduction paris ce is foreseen as a contributor to achieve the paris targets by including for instance a co tax per product which could result in a more realistic price of products and simultaneously have impact on sustainable development goal responsible production and consumption in reality a plethora of environmental costs are not yet internalised in the product price so this can be an opportunity to also reduce the prices of some products when they proved to be produced under any or similar of the r cramer frameworks the ce and zw nexus deploys as it was here above briefly discussed a large number of current and future research opportunities the chapters compiling this book have tried to illustrate such potential but we as editors have to admit that the ce topic is such a prolific and dynamic field that results currently impossible to completely describe it in other words this book aims to be a piece of work in progress that connects two relevant topics to transform wastes into resources ce and zw ml
