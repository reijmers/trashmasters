5.1. Relevance,  feasibility  and prioritization  of circular  strategies  
The idea of the circular  economy  in the food and water sectors  
entails several  strategies  and numerous  applicable  ideas concep-  
tualized  by this paper and mapped  in the context  of the GCC re- 
gion. In this region,  the notion of circularity  in these vital sectors  
is highly relevant  and recently  receiving  more attention  in practice.  
It is especially  relevant  for achieving  sectoral,  macro-level  goals of 
increasing  local food production  while improving  the sustainability  
of water use. Self-suﬃciency  ratios in the region are low; e.g., as 
of 2012 accounting  for 14.6%, 15.6%, 32.5%, 9.6%, 30.1%, and 21.2% 
for Bahrain,  Kuwait,  Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,  and the UAE, re- 
spectively,  with an average  value of 26.5% for the whole region 
( Alpen Capital,  2015 ). This is despite  these ratios increasing  re- 
markably  in all countries,  with Oman as the most self-suﬃcient  
country  in the GCC in terms of food production  in 2019, meeting  
25%, 70%, and 80% of its respective  dairy, fruit, and vegetable  de- 
mand from local sources  ( Alpen Capital,  2019 ). For other countries  
such as Qatar, food self-suﬃciency  has become  a vital goal, partic- 
ularly after the blockade  imposed  on Qatar in June 2017 and lifted 
in early 2021. As a result, a holistic  strategy  has been developed  to 
ensure improvement  in all related  sectors.  One of the main targets  
consists  of achieving  100% self-suﬃciency  in a number  of critical  
commodities,  including  fresh poultry,  and at a lower rate (70%) for
