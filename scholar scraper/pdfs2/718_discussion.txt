of the previous
sections have shown the signi ﬁcant developments in enzyme-
based production of valuable compounds from phenolic acidsduring the past few decades. Various bioconversions of PAs arerobust and feasible under mild and environmentally friendlyconditions. Both native and engineered biocatalysts withpromising catalytic e ﬃciency and excellent stability were
employed in puri ﬁed, lysate, or immobilized forms as well as
in whole-cell harboring or displaying targeted enzymes on thecell surface for PAs bioconversion. Products from PAderivatives such as alkyl gallates, vanillin, CAPE, vinylphenols,
vanillylamine, and trihydroxyaromatic acids exhibit outstanding
biological activities which are useful for applications in thefood, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and polymer industries.
Several examples of bioconversions gave high conversion
percentages in short reaction times with excellent biocatalystreusability. Yield of CAPE production of 93% can be achieved
within 2.5 h and the biocatalyst can be reused for up to 20
