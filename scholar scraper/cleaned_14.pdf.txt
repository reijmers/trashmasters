flow Greenhouse gas savingsCircular economyABSTRACT Environmentally sound management of plastic packaging waste is an issue of concern around the world because it causes potential threats to oceans and the environment upon disposal and mismanagement This study ex amines the current efforts on recycling of the waste by extended producer responsibility EPR in South Korea aswell as other countries Material flow analysis MFA was performed on plastic packaging by life cycle Based on the results in this study material footprint of common single use plastics ie PET water bottles plastic cups plastic bags and plasticcontainers and cutlery by food delivery by consumption was estimated to be on average kg or disposable plastics per capita a year resulting in billion disposable plastics and ton of waste for disposal in South Korea Approximately million ton of plastic packaging waste from household waste streams in in South Korea was generated and treated by energy recovery with solid refuse fuels andheat recovery incineration without energy recovery material recycling and landfilling Material recycling andrecovery rates of plastic packaging waste from households were relativelylow at and respectively It was estimated that as much as million ton of CO eq was generated from million ton of plastic waste by incineration in Approximately million ton CO eq could be avoided by material recycling Challenges and efforts have been discussed to improve current recycling system of plastic packaging waste towards a circular economy Introduction Packaging materials such as papers paper boards plastics alu minum steel cans and glassjars are commonly used for enclosing or protecting products during distribution storage sale delivery and use The preference and use of such packaging materials depend on the types of products cost and packing purpose Plastic packaging has been gaining popularity among the packaging materials due to its lower price lightness easytouse resistance to corrosive and structural properties High density polyethylene HDPE low density poly ethylene LDPE polyethylene terephthalate PET polypropylene PP polystyrene PS and polyvinyl chloride PVC are commonlyused plastic resins in packaging applications for a variety of products including bottles and tubes packs and cups trays bags caps bubble wrapping and films containers and many othersPlastic packagingand containers are the largest application among industrialapplications from the worldwide plastic production approximately million per year followed by building and construction materials and textiles Geyer et al The global plastic pro duction is expected to continually increase from million ton in to million ton in Ryan The large consumer demands for plastic packaging materials lar gely shortterm and singleuse materials designed for immediate dis posal after use have resulted in tremendous amounts of plastic waste to be managedfor treatment and disposal Itwas estimated that more than million ton of plastic waste was generated in Geyer et al According to the study approximately of the waste was disposed in landfills dumps or in the environment while incinerationand recycling were only and respectively Geyer et al In EU recent statistics revealed that more than million ton of plastic packaging waste was produced in The material recycling rate for the packaging waste was approximately million ton on  Received December Received in revised form February Accepted February Corresponding author Email addresses gogatorcnuackr YC Jang gaineegmailcom G

Plastics Europe Eurostat Recently the European Council European Parliament and European Commission made anagreement in to set a new target for plastic packaging recycling at by to be increased to by European Commission In Japan more than million ton of plastic waste was generated in More than of plastic waste was treated by incineration with power generation and heat recovery refuse derived fuel and auxiliary fuels in cement kilns while the ma terial recycling accounted for only Japan PWMI In July the Chinese government announced that plastic waste materials or scraps from outside China were prohibited to import in China for protecting its environment and public health because toxic materials were often found in mixed plastic waste streams Due to this action plastic waste that was once exported to China for recycling and treatment remains in many countries Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection A recent study reported that about million tons of plastic waste will be displaced with the Chinese import ban by Brooks et al This may cause unstable conditions inthe recyclingindustry by exceeding itscapacityHowever it can also give an opportunity for countries that have heavily relied on China to identify better solutions to deal with everincreasing plastic waste and establish local recycling industry Some fractions of plastic waste are commonly found in oceans beach coastal lines and river and streams RaumSuryan et al Romeo et al Jambeck et al Romeo et al Turner et al Li et al Alam et al Such misman agement of the waste can cause environmental damages ecological impacts

storage or sponge absorbing toxic chemicals in the environment AlOdani et al Rani et al Turner and Holmes Jang et al Song et al This may create serious concerns regarding the potential contamination of marine organisms that can be consumed as dietary activities by people In response to the growing concern many countries have been trying to develop proper management strategy and regulations on plastic packaging waste in a circular economy European Commission Marieke et al Japan MOE Korea MOE The circular economy is designed to transform current linear economic structure consisting of extraction production consumption and disposal stages to a circular economic structure by reducing the use of limited natural resources and minimizing environ mental burdens within the economic system in our society European Commission a In order to transform into a circular economy life cycle of product should be considered by supporting the creation of an economy designed for circulation of resources in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner For example more dur able and ecofriendly products are designed and packaging using sus tainable materials which can be easily recycled are manufactured Producers take full responsibility of the recovery of resources over the life cycle of their product and packaging Consumers can contribute to the circular economy by green consumption assetsharing and product reuse Recently EU strategy for plastics in the circular economy was developed to establish new plastics economy in EU along with several targetsSome specific goals with timelines include all plastic packaging materials placed on the EU market that can be reusable or recyclable in acosteffective way by more than half of plastic waste generated in

and legislation on singleuse plastics European Commission Foschi and Bonoli In Japan Re source circulation strategy forplastics was developed to reduce the useof singleuse plastics and promote the development and use of sub stitutes for petroleumbased plastics in The specific goals with timelines include the cumulative reduction of singleuse plastics generation by reusable and recyclable design for all containers and packagingproducts by recycling rate of plastic containers and packaging by effective use of used plastics by including circulareconomymeasuresdoublinguseofrecycledmaterialsbyand maximum introduction million tons of biomass plastics by Japan MOE While the recycling statistics of waste components are readily available in developed countries there are still very limited studies regarding environmentally sound management practices of plastic packaging waste and their quantitative flow towards a circular economy Bernardo et al Eygen et al Dahlbo et al Millette et al The material flow of plastic packaging waste in households is very important to develop appropriate waste manage ment policy for recycling and treatment as well as to prevent plastic pollution in ecosystem especially in oceans This study presents the overview of current recycling and manage ment practices of plastic packaging waste by extended producer re sponsibility EPR in South Korea More specifically our study ex amined the generation recycling rates for resource recovery and treatment of the waste Material flow analysis MFA for plastic packaging was performed to provide its quantitative pathways by life cycle Material footprint of singleuse plastics based on selected items single use plastic bags plastic cups PET water bottles and plastic cutlery was provided to elucidate the consumption rate per capita It discussed recent efforts and performance regarding the recycling and management by comparing with Japan and selected EU countries Belgium France Germany and UK The greenhouse gas reduction potentials by the recycling and source reduction of the waste were evaluated by using the Waste Reduction Model WARM developed by theUS Environmental Protection Agency US EPA Finally some challenges and efforts are discussed to improve the management of plastic packaging waste towards a circular economy Methodology The methodology employed in this study included gathering data associated with monitoring results of waste management performed by EPR and national waste generation and disposal status reported by the Korea Ministry of Environment Korea MOE site visits to plastic re cycling facilities having interviews and conversations with field site workers and holding expert meetings with government industry and academia We also conducted literature review of published reports and scientific papers analysis of available statistics and data of the EPR system published by Institute European Environment Policy IEEP OECD and EU European Commission Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Institute European Environmental Policy IEEP Data sources and material flow analysis Recentregulationsonplastic wastescientificpapers releasedpress and previous research report related to its recycling and disposal have been examined The EPR results were evaluated based on the volume put on the market recycling amounts and recycling rate statistics of plastic packaging materials PET bottles single and composite or multi layer plastic films and sheets and expanded polystyrene from to in South Korea We compared and analyzed the EPR systems of packagingwasteintheselectedcountries intermsofthegenerationand recycling and recovery rates Interviews with field experts such as government officials and Korea Packaging Recycling Cooperative andYC Jang et al Resources Conservation Recycling the IEEP UK London branch were conducted to examine current efforts on new policy operation status and limitations of the EPR systems in EU Statistical data such as national waste statistics published by the Korea MOE Japan and Eurostat in EU were analyzed to examine the trends of plastic packaging waste generation and recycling Material flow analysis was conducted to elucidate quantitative flow of plastic packaging by life cycle ie production consumption collection and sorting and recycling and treatment and disposal Table presents the sources of data and relevant references for the analysis GHG reduction potentials by recycling and source reduction The amounts of greenhouse gasses generated by incineration of packaging waste and reduced by assuming it was recycled were cal culated by the US EPA WARM The WARM is a tool that calculates the GHG emissions energy savings and economic impacts of baseline and alternative waste management practices including source reduction recycling combustion composting and anaerobic digestion and land filling GHG savings are calculated by comparing the emissions asso ciated with managing materials under an alternative scenario with theemissions associated with a baseline scenario ie current practices as opposed to multiplying the quantity of materials managed by emission factors US EPA WARM Not only recycling scenarios but also potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by source reduction scenarios were calculated for estimating the potential reduction and summarized the results We also estimated economic profits from GHG gas reduction by the scenarios based on market values in the emission trading scheme in South Korea Results and discussion Production and consumption of packaging waste Plastic production has been increasing worldwide as it is applicable to many industries as well as daily household goods due to its out standing physical and chemical properties A plastic manufacturing industry belongs to petrochemical industry and petrochemical industry that produces synthetic resin synthetic fiber raw material synthetic rubber and various basic chemical products from petroleum products or natural gas as raw materials A domestic demand for plastics or syn thetic resins in South Korea is shown in Fig The domestic demand has been continually increased from million in ton to million ton in over the period As of the most demanded material among the resins is PP followed by PVC LDPE and HDPE Such synthetic resins are used for many industrial applications such as packaging building and construction transportation electronics and electrical equipment household consumer products and textiles A comparison analysis of plastic consumption by industry type from the world Japan and South Korea was conducted as shown in Fig The largest consumption of plastics was found to be packaging applicationsIn Japanmore than millionof plastic packaging andcontainers out ofapproximately million ton were manufactured in followed by electrical and electronics million ton auto mobiles million ton building and construction million ton in Japan PWMI In South Korea plastics were manufactured for packaging and containers million ton building and construction materials million ton automobiles ton and household consumer products ton electrical and electronics ton and agricultural and fishery products ton KEI Consumptions of singleuse plastic packaging Plastic raw materials are sold and consumed by consumers as plastic products such as various packaging materials and containers Much of plastic packaging is made of singleuse plastics Europe has been ac tively responding to the problem of singleuse plastics including a regulatory policy based on the most plastic wastes found on beaches in Europe European Commission UNEP According to a previous study plastic waste accounted for of the total waste based on the result of monitoring waste on beaches in South Korea Plastic packaging materials such as beverage bottles snack bags plastic bags and styrofoam containers have been commonly found on coastal lines Korea Marine Litter Information System In this study we collected basic data and estimated consumptions for four types of singleuse plastics PET drinking bottles single useplastic cups singleuse plastic bags and singleuse plastic containers and cutlery for food delivery that are commonly used in plastic packaging materials in South Korea For estimates of singleuse plastic consumptions of selected four products basic data such as consumption amounts consumption frequency the sales of products and the number of food delivery in the country were collected By using such data material footprints of singleuse plastics by the consumption for each product were calculated More detail data and calculation methods are available in Supplementary Materials Table S through S Table shows the material footprints of singleuse plastics in South Korea Asshown in Table approximately billion units of singleuse plastics were consumed per year units with annual plastic consumption per capita based on the four items The singleuse plastic consumption per capita per year was kg resulting in ton of singleuse plastic waste It should be noted that the actual footprint may be much higher than the calculated footprint because other than the four items in this study many singleuse plastics can be included such as plastic straws colored PET bottles carbonated beverage PET bottles plastic films singleuse razors and tooth brushes and many others As the number of singlehousing family is growing the consumption of plastic packaging materialsused forfood delivery maybe expected toincreaseTable Methods for data collection and acquisition for material flow analysis of plastics in South Korea Life cycle Type of data
