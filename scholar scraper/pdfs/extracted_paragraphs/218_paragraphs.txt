An intervention is needed to b ring stakeholders together to  solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the  fundamental  issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainab le and smart country-wide waste  management system. The system should provide a mult i-dimensional approach, determine the  maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of  designing a new strategy to minimise waste manageme nt problems. A comprehensive  systematic literature review, intensive focus group  discussions, and direct observation  in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develo p waste management business  processes and their system design. Waste business p rocesses consist of mixed- collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment , and chained-disposal. The design of  the proposed waste management system presents circu lar economy processes that can  separate municipal waste, identify waste characteri stics, and determine sustainable  waste treatment technologies through the use of Int ernet of Thing  as the  integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable developme nt goals  such as Good  health, and wellbeing ; Clean water and sani tation ; Decent Work and  Economic Growth ; Responsible Consumption an d Production  and Climate  Action . The study proposes a new design of smart and sustai nable waste  management which could achieve satisfactory economi c, social, and environmental  waste management performances.

The nation’s  enormous waste production demands  even more space dedicated to landfills, which compe tes with the community's need for more  sustainable sites. When landfills become overburden ed, excess waste is then burned in open  and uncontrolled ways or it is spilled into waterwa ys.  Both methods increase the risk of  disease, pollution, and hazardous emissions for Ind onesian citizens. Further, the landfills  themselves, called Waste Mountains, are dangerous a reas because they attract scavengers, trash  collectors, and informal workers. Based on research  conducted in Jakarta, Semarang,  Yogyakarta, and Magelang in 2018, the mainstream of  municipal waste is collected from  households and traditional markets. Municipal waste  is initially collected at a temporary  collection point . The TPS is divided into sev eral different area functions: 3R (reduce,  reuse, recycle), TPS with multi-compartments, and T PS with waste type-based schedule. These  divisions are enacted before waste is sent to its f inal disposal centre . The majority of  waste collection activities are still conducted man ually by both formal and informal sectors  . A regular schedule is observ ed, but there is a limited use of facilities or  infrastructure. Most collected waste is still mixed  and unsorted, because most residents do not  properly separate waste.   Based on their characteristics, most collected wast e is processed through composting,  recycling, gasification, anaerobic digestion, or wa ste-to-energy systems. However, this  approach has not optimally touched the economic, so cial, and environmental aspects of the  waste management system. Regulations for  waste management in Indonesia are obvious and  sufficient. For instance, Law No. 18/2008 concerns solid waste management, Government  Regulation No. 81/2012 addresses economic-oriented household waste management, and the  ministerial decree of environmental department Act No. 13/2012 focuses on reduce, reuse,  recycle actions through the waste bank. Further, th e Ministerial decree of the Interior No.  33/2010 about waste management concerns the involve ment of the community as waste  producers in the waste management system, Ministeri al decree public work No. 03/2013  governs household waste management, and Presidentia l regulation No. 97/2017 is concerned  with household waste national policy and strategy. Despite these decrees, most waste  management systems in Indonesia are still tradition al and conventional. Open dumping,  transferring, collecting, and landfill are the most  common methods of disposal in some urban  cities. A sustainable waste management system is fa r from standard. In short, current waste  management systems are not yet integrated, particip ation from corporations is rare, social  awareness about environmental cleanliness is limite d, and government policies are not yet  optimally applied.  The current waste management system is not able to identify specific characteristics, types, and  amounts of municipal waste collected in the final c ollection centre, nor is that system able to  provide sufficient, accessible, reliable, accurate,  or timely  information for applying  appropriate treatment technologies to manage the wa ste in economically, socially, and  environmentally beneficial ways. A comprehensive s ystem intervention is needed to bring  stakeholders together to solve these waste problems .   The use of Information and Communication Technology   and the Internet of Things   offer a new generation approach to improve the glob al waste management system effectively  and efficiently in developed countries. The ICT-IoT  integration consists of the use of local  sensing, data integration, analytics of things, and  cognitive action in the area of waste  management. Waste activity could be real-time track ed and monitored to enable an efficient  and effective waste management and to transform lar ge and complex waste characteristics to  become valuable resource, materials, and energy (Ad am, Okasha, Tawfeeq, Margan, &  Nasreldeen, 2018; Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017; Gut iérrez et al., 2014).  The research questions we plan to explore include:   What is the current waste management system in Indo nesia?,   At what level of maturity is the current system?, a nd   What appropriate approaches and strategies are need ed to achieve the expected level?.   This research has developed an innovative assessmen t to measure the existing performance of  the waste management system, and we have developed a sustainable and smart waste  management system based on the maturity level of th e current system. The sustainable and  smart waste management system provides a better dec ision-making process and policy  supports, appropriate treatment technologies, optim al waste, and resource recovery methods,  which helps to achieve sustainable development goal s  . It uses minimal virgin materials  and low energy consumption, low environmental degra dation and pollution, and it supports  highly skilled workers as it enhances social values .  The remainder of this paper continues as follows: S ection 2 presents the materials and methods.  Section 3 outlines the results. Section 4 analyses and discusses these results through our case study.   Section 5 summarises the conclusions.  2. Materials and Methods  The objectives of this study are to investigate the  issues and opportunities of developing a country- wide waste management system in the industrial revo lution 4.0 era. We also seek to design a  sustainable and smart waste management system with a multidimensional approach, to present the  maturity level of the waste management system in it s technical method, and to design a new  approach of sustainable and smart waste management for Indonesian urban cities. Partially, the IOT  and ICT development and implementation in the waste  management value change is concerned.  The study consists of the following steps:  a.  Case study in four urban cities of Indonesia (i.e.,  Jakarta, Magelang, Semarang,  Yogyakarta). These cities were selected on the basi s that they have applied the smart city  program through the implementation of smart environ ment, which also is concern with  waste management; they have also agreed to particip ate in the study.   b.  Direct observation of both final and temporary disp osal centres and landfill areas of the four  cities, and the waste management value chain, inclu ding collection, selection, transportation,  processing, and landfilling.  c.  Direct communication with and semi-structured quest ionnaires sent to government  personnel from municipality and environmental depar tments, collection centre agents,  scavengers, recycling industries, and the general c ommunity. The semi-structured  questionnaire was a mix of questions related to was te management requirements, real case  performance, challenges, and expectations to achiev e better economic, social, and  environmental performance. The respondents were cha racterised on their level of expertise  and their job structure.  Government personnel were  selected at head of department levels  and field supervisors, and collection centre agents  and industry respondents were selected at  the level of operation manager. The community respo ndents were selected at the level of  community leaders.  d.  Intensive discussion with circular economy and ICT practitioners and experts about relevant  topics in the waste management value chain. More th an 40 articles are used as reference in  the study.   e.  An in-depth analysis of the current situation was c ompleted, to determine the maturity level  of the current waste management, and state-of-the-a rt and future expectations for sustainable  and smart waste management.   f.  Framework development of a sustainable waste manage ment system is performed, followed  by the proposed system.     Direct observation was conducted at the municipalit ies of the four cities to deliver the semi- structured questionnaire.  Questions focused on these central issues:  a.  What – regulation , waste type , waste  characteristics , facil ity capacity , waste  transportation vehicles , treatment te chnology , ICT  and IOT adoption, future development.  b.  Where – sources, location of collection centre, fin al disposal centre, temporary disposal  centre, and landfill area, distance from civilizati on, transportation route.  c.  Who – recyclers, city municipality, scavengers, com munity, government, NGO, recycling  industry, direct and non-direct labourers, private company, investors.  d.  When – waste management schedule, facility maintena nce, established date.  e.  How – volume, route, selection method, distance, nu mber of scavengers, waste management  promotion, managed waste volume, unmanaged waste vo lume, processed waste volume,  supply chain, waste level, GHG level, automation.   Some examples of questionnaires are presented as fo llows:  a.  Where is the site location of the temporary and fin al disposal centres? Are they near to the  community? How far is the distance between the temp orary site to the final or to the landfill  centre?   b.  What are the treatment processes conducted in the c entre?  Are there specific selection or  segregation methods applied before the waste is tra nsported to the next step?   c.  What are the transportation tools and vehicles used  to transfer the waste from centre to  centre? Please include the tools used and the vehic le capacity and type.   d.  How many labourers are involved in the waste manage ment process in the city? Are these  labourers formal  or are they non-formal  labourers ?  e.  What are the types, volume, characteristics of the waste (i.e., physical, biological,  chemicals, non-organic and organic wastes) found in  the waste management area?  f.  What are the sources of the waste ?  g.  What are the treatment technologies and infrastruct ure applied in the area? Include  recycling, reuse, recondition, ICT, and IoT usages.    h.  What are the regulations, policies, community commi tment, and local wisdom available in  the cities?     In total, there were 78 respondents willing to answ er the questions. The results were analysed to  identify the current issues and opportunities of th e industrial revolution 4.0 waste management.     The state-of-the-art of the waste management system  in the industrial revolution 4.0 (i.e.,  digitalization, environmentally conscious, socially  aware) gathered from the experts’ contributions  and publications were used as the fundamental ideas  to develop the framework of sustainable and  smart waste management. The literature review relev ant with waste management topics, including  digitalization in industrial revolution 4.0, IoT fo r waste management, smart waste collection  system, circular economy, and IoT were evaluated an d identified to understand the contributions of  previous research.   Furthermore, an in-depth research on current waste management and its treatment technology in  Indonesia was conducted for 2 years .  The results gained from this research were  collected to determine the current maturity positio n of the sustainable waste management in  Indonesian cities. A number of regulations, policie s, and strategies applied by the local and national   governments were intensively discussed for better f uture approach.     3. Results   3.1 Research method implementation   This research consists of several stages, including  determining the research questionnaire,  developing case studies, determining the maturity l evel, developing multi-dimensions of sustainable  and smart waste management, and analysing the gap t o determine the current maturity level of each  city we investigated. The maturity levels of the cu rrent waste management are ultimately used to  develop a newly designed smart waste management sys tem.     3.2 Case study on urban cities   As mentioned in the previous section, we interviewe d in four urban cities (Semarang, Magelang,  Yogyakarta, Jakarta) and to various stakeholders (s cavengers, waste collection agencies,  community, recycling industry).  Individuals were i nterviewed regarding the existing performance  of their waste management and future opportunities.  From these five main question areas, specific  open-ended questions were formulated. The questions  were given to respondents at the four cities  through direct interview, mails, and communication.  The results of the direct interview and  communication are presented as follows.    Semarang waste management   Semarang is the capital city of Central Java. Jatib arang is the centre of waste disposal area of  Semarang City. To reduce the amount of waste, the S emarang Government uses a 3R strategy under  the national regulation number 18/2008 about waste management. Integrated waste management is  located in the centre of Semarang City and is contr olled by the Environmental Department.  There  are two waste management facilities that belong to Semarang City: a final disposal centre  at  Jatibarang, Kedungpane, and Mijen, and a temporary disposal centre  at Jatisari, Mijen. The  TPA was built in 1993 and still has 9 years to be u sed. The area of TPA is about 46.44ha and the  usable area is about 23.22ha. Sanitary landfill is the operation system conducted in the TPA. To  manage the liquid waste created, the TPA is facilit ated with leachate IPAL, disposal zone, drainage  and operation line gate, and the development of met hane  for household gas and electricity  energy. The distance from the community area is abo ut 2 km away, the distance to the nearest water  body is 2 km, and the distance to the beach is 10 k m away. The waste management operation in the  TPA is under the DELH environment regulation, and i t is managed by the Environment and Life  Department. On the other side, the TPST was built i n 2010 under the Analysis of Environment  Management protection. To manage the waste, the ope ration system segregates the waste and runs  composting. The total area of the TPST is about 2ha  and the use of the area is about 2ha. The  distance from TPST to community area is about 2 km,  the distance from TPST to water body is 2  km, and the distance from TPST to beach is 10 km. I nstead of a governmental department as  overseer, the waste collector industry and scavenge rs are two main informal elements involved in  the waste management system in Semarang. It is foun d that the average waste collector is able to  collect about 50kg waste per day, while scavengers collect 5kg per day. Waste management is  conducted by Government Environmental Agency by the  help of PT Narpati, which changes the  organic waste into granule compost and, secondly, c hanges the organic waste into refuse-derived  fuel. The final collection centre is at Jatibarang with the area size of 46,0183ha. Methane gas  created from the waste is distributed to the commun ity as cooking gas. Through cooperation with  Denmark, it is expected to generate about 1.2MW of electricity. Non-valuable waste is dumped and  managed using sanitary landfill; the waste is cover ed with land. The waste generated in Semarang is  62% organic and 36% inorganic.  Waste volume is abo ut 900 tons/day, and the capacity of the  waste management in the TPA is 1200 tons/day. The f low of waste starts from community level  waste collection, then is sent to TPS using communi ty vehicles, and finally sent to TPA by the  environmental agency trucks. There are about 268 TP S located in the Semarang area. The type of  waste consists of plastic, steel, rubber, paper, fo od waste, garden greens, and dry branches.     Magelang waste management   The waste management system is still a big problem for Greater Magelang including Magelang City  and Magelang Regency. Waste generation in Magelang City reaches 0.4 kg per person per day,  while Magelang Regency generates 0.47 kg per person  per day in 2017. This creates a significant  amount of waste: 19,000 tons per year for Magelang City and 236,000 tons of waste per year for  Magelang Regency. Organic waste in Magelang City is  about 74% of the total waste, while organic  waste for Magelang Regency is about 54% of the tota l waste. Waste management (servicing,  management, collection, processing) is regularly co nducted by the city’s and regency’s  Environmental Agency every day. The City of Magelan g has no waste disposal centre due to its  limited area. Currently, waste from the city munici pal is sent to a final disposal centre that belongs   to Regency of Magelang. TPS is the temporary collec tion centre  in which waste is  separated into recycled waste  and non-recy cled waste. The city has 5 TPS 3R and 13  transfer stations. The environmental agency of the city has 200 employees for managing the waste,  while the environmental agency of the regency has 1 94 employees. Three-wheeled motors, pick-up  cars, and trucks are transportation vehicles used i n both cities. The waste treatment technologies  applied in the city consist of composting, leachate  treatment, landfill gas collection. However,  limited technology, human resources, and financial support to provide appropriate treatment  technology are a big challenge for Magelang City to  manage their waste sustainably. In addition,  many informal sectors, including scavengers and pri vate waste collectors, work independently in  unhealthy and dangerous workplaces.     Yogyakarta waste management  The waste management system in Yogyakarta or called  Jogja is conducted by two Agencies,  including the Provincial Environmental Agency and t he Regional Development Agency.  Regulations stem from local government decree numbe r 10, 2012 about waste management. The  waste is collected from the community and then sent  to a temporary collection centre before it is  sent to a final collection centre. The contribution s of waste generation in Yogyakarta come from  municipal, hospital, hotel, and tourism areas; othe r city waste collected and managed by the  Environment Service Agency is about 200 tons/day or  about 10-15 trucks daily. The number of  labourers involved in the waste management is about  430 individuals, consisting of 170 technicians,  160 government labourers, 80 segregators, and 20 no n-government labourers. There are also about  500 scavengers and 500 cows at the final waste coll ection centre . The primary challenge  faced by Yogyakarta waste management system is a la ck of community awareness on waste  management. The final disposal centre is a regional  TPA in which waste comes from Sleman  , Yogyakarta City , and Bantul . The  TPS is not fairly distributed to Yogyakarta  area. A lot of waste comes from Sleman and its surr ounding area. Waste is mounting steadily in the  Yogyakarta TPA. Technically, the waste sent to TPA from TPS uses 6 truck deliveries, and the  labour is 24 hours standing by to clean the TPS. Th e waste in TPS is not 100% non-organic; the  most waste is residue. The number of depots is abou t 11 units.  Cow farming in the waste area  belongs to the community. Disposal waste costs abou t 200 million per month for 25 thousand tons.  The city’s budget per year is 20 billion. Total exp enditures of 20 billion consider about 16 billion  for waste, and 4 billion for fuels. The benefit ret ribution is about 3.3 billion and it is returned to   community at a rate of about 25%. The community is charged for waste collection activity with a  current rate of about 200 thousand to 1 million rup iah/family.      Jakarta waste management  Waste management in Jakarta is conducted by the Pro vincial Environmental Service Agency with  large areas landfilled without a treatment facility . In Jakarta, sanitary landfilling takes place. The   landfill area known as “Pyramid” has developed simp le water treatment installation   technology through water filtering from waste. Powe rhouse/electricity booths that convert methane  to electricity are available. Composting from tradi tional market waste produces 40 tons of  compost/day. Bantar Gebang is the integrated waste processing site for Jakarta city. Jakarta  produces nearly more than 10 million tons of waste annually, and this amount increases 2-4%  annually; it is expected to exceed the waste manage ment capacity by 2019. The main waste in  Jakarta is organic waste, which comprises about 74%  of the total waste. It is predicted that by 2019,  the volume of waste in Jakarta will reach 7.8 thous and tons/day. Household  is the  largest waste source, followed by traditional marke ts. To improve waste management, Jakarta’s  government has introduced some eco-technology throu gh TPST, TPST 3R, and intermediate waste  facilities, composting, and waste banks. Waste to E nergy is one potential treatment technology  project planned to reduce Jakarta’s waste.     3.3. State-of-the-art sustainable and smart waste m anagement   A literature review of current organic waste manage ment and treatment technology for developed  countries, including US, Canada, Mexico, Australia,  NZ, Japan, and the European Union, found that  the waste management and treatment technology is ra pidly improving with more efficiency and  greater environmentally sound practices. Developed countries place greater emphasis on the  advantages of modern engineered landfills, recyclin g technology, incineration, mechanical  biological treatment , and anaerobic digestion . Other emerging countries, such as China,  India, and Asian countries , emphasise composting, limited  incineration, MBT, and anaerobic digestion (Artiola , 2019; Damanhuri et al., 2014; IA. Jereme,  Siwar, & Alam, 2014; Islam, Hannan, Arebey, & Basri , 2012; Jouhara et al., 2017; Tchobanoglous,  Theisen, & Vigil, 1993; Woodard & Curran, Inc., 200 7). Those waste management and treatment  technologies offer some benefits, including economi c , social , and  environmental  to manage the wast e.  Waste management is a complex activity  that not only concerns disposal activity, but also focuses on collection systems, transportation,  temporary storage, processing, and disposal. Instea d of strictly implementing 6R strategy,  developed nations like US, UK, Australia, and Japan  have applied advanced methods of waste  collection such as underground waste collection sys tems, Geographic information system   technology, solid waste bin monitoring system using  GSM technology, and indoor/outdoor waste  compactors .  Underground waste collection system is a new techno logy of waste storage that replaces  technologies such as waste bins with underground co llection points for collecting recyclables,  organic wastes, and oils. The technology is suitabl e for extremely hot climates, requires less  maintenance, and is more aesthetically acceptable. GIS technology is an integrated application  dedicated to individual or association municipaliti es to manage optimally and automatically each  phase of the waste entire chain/cycle from waste pr oduction point to recycling/treatment point or  final disposal point .  The latest techno logy for waste collection and monitoring is Global  System of Mobile  . This technology uses sensors  that are placed in public garbage bins to assess th e optimal level of waste inside of the bin (Misra,  Das, Chakrabortty, & Das, 2018). When the garbage t ouches the threshold level, through SMS  using GSM, the sensor will send an indication to co ntroller, and further sends an indication to the  collection truck driver to collect garbage immediat ely. Compact garbage collection trucks are the  latest technology used by many developing countries  in order to increase the collection capacity of  vehicles. Due to narrow roads, some waste compactor s are designed in small collection trucks using  lightweight materials for optimising the load capac ity.     Along with the development and implementation of sm art city technologies and platforms, new  solutions for intelligent waste collection and sort ing are being developed. While an intelligent  garbage collection system using information technol ogy and computers is still in its initial phase,  Smart Bins have begun to be used to collect garbage . Smart Bins are trash bins equipped with  ultrasonic sensors with the function of measuring t he space of the trash can. A sensor gateway uses  the WLAN protocol, and the collection, analysis, an d visualization of junk data uses the cloud  platform. Some literature presents IoT platforms fo r waste management, such as Zanella and  Vangelista who present IoT platform solutions for t he smart city, with a case study on the city of  Padova . In Romania, the garbage collection  system for the historic city centre of Sibiu was de veloped based on several parameters: garbage  volume , composition of waste, source concentration,  current infrastructure, distance from the source, a nd the level of public attention (Ciudin et al.,  2014). In Sweden, the automatic waste collection sy stem is limited to four types of waste: general  waste, organic waste, recycled paper, and cardboard . This system cannot collect WEEE, batteries,  light bulbs and fluorescent lamps, hard sheets, gla ss receivers, etc. (Bernstad, La Cour Jansen, &  Aspegren, 2011).   The further step, one that is very important in was te management, is known as waste processing.  Autoclaving, fluffing, and melting technology are t he latest technologies for waste processing (Gao  & Li, 2011). Autoclaving technology applies steam t reatment to the waste at 140-160 degrees C for  30-40 minutes in order to sterilize the waste, and then the residue can be screened. In this process,  waste is separated on the basis of weight, while gl ass and dirt are removed from organic fibres, and  metals and plastics are sent to the recycle process . The organic fibre is used for land applications  and Refuse-Derived Fuel  production . Fluffing is a waste processing  technology in which the solid waste is separated an d sterilized, and the organic portion is processed  to become pulp material known as fluff. This techno logy produces fluff rich with organic base and  high nitrogen. A lot of western countries adopt thi s technology with some recycling rates achieving  95% of total waste. The next current technology exa mined by both developed and developing  countries is melting technology, which can melt the  waste through fuel and electricity combustion  to reduce the waste volume. This technology is bett er than incineration, as it solves the fly ash  problem and stabilises metal portions. Incineration  technology is a thermal waste treatment in  which untreated waste is burned at a high temperatu re. Some European countries  have applied  this technology to process their waste. The Japanes e have introduced a new incineration technology  which is pollutant free by recycling ash and removi ng the acidic gases through a control  technology. Vermi composting is the latest common t echnology used by Japan and UK, in which  animal, pharmaceutical, food, and sewage wastes are  transformed through earthworms into vermi  wash which contains high nitrogen, phosphate, and p otassium contents. Energy recovery  technology is the last phase before disposal proces s, in which all waste residues are inaugurated for  a renewable energy alternative. This technology con sists of bio and thermal conversion  technologies. Thermal conversion is water/heat pres sure utilised technology that converts organic  and inorganic waste  int o useful chemicals and compounds through a  thermal processing system. The next technology is a dvanced thermal treatment technologies, which  include pyrolysis, gasification, and excluded incin eration. Pyrolysis converts waste to liquid or  gaseous fuels together with the residue, which is a  combination of non-combustible material and  carbon. Gasification presents partial oxidation of a substance, which occurs between combustion  and pyrolysis. Gasification products are similar to  pyrolysis, and include syngas and low C ash.  Gasification is economically and environmentally so und technology to maintain landfill  sustainability. Biofuel can also be produced from f ood waste through a variety of fermentation  processes. Currently, hydrogen, ethanol, biodiesel and biogas are produced by using valorization,  which is a thermopile process without biogas recirc ulation involved (Artiola, 2019; Millard, 2017;  Ministry of the Environment, 2012; Srivastava, 2016 ; Tisserant et al., 2017; Wajeeha et al., 2016).  The last step of waste management system is the dis posal process, in which the invaluable waste  that comes from residue of trash, recycling, and ot her treatment technology is disposed. As disposal  is the most technical step, some advanced technolog ies are urgently required to be developed. Most  disposal sites in developing countries are still op en dumps, without appropriate leachate treatment  and landfill gas utilization; therefore, they cause  many aesthetic and other environmental issues.  Landfill is an efficiently engineered depression in  low population area for final disposal. In this  depression, the waste is buried to avoid any hydrau lic relation between trash and environment (air  and water). Bioreactor is one of the latest technol ogies to process waste disposed. The objective of  bioreactor is to improve the decomposition rate, le achate circulation, and microbial growth.  The  conventional landfill technology is used to dry the  waste. The latest technology is to generate  electricity from waste through micro turbines, whic h are optimally applied to small scale projects.  The technology can reduce the issue of pollution an d emissions of landfill gas air. The Indonesian  sanitary landfill, a major disposal activity, is de signed as monitored landfill. However, the waste  source is operated under an open dumping system whi ch creates serious environmental problems  (Bronson, 2017; Pariatamby, A. & Tanaka, 2015; Rawl ins, Beyer, Lampreia, & Tumiwa, 2014; H.  Sudibyo et al., 2017)   3.3 Developing Multi-dimensions of Sustainable and Smart Waste Management  Sustainability has become a topic of debate and it is a target achievement for many countries  . Also, sustainability turn  into a fundamental part of waste management,  Sustainable waste management is a circular feedback  system which concerns process activities,  adaptability, and the diversity of waste from manuf acturing to disposal phase .   Industrial Revolution 4.0 has brought significant c hanges in global waste management and value  changes . T hat framework consists of five aspects,  including governance, economy, social, environmenta l, and technological.   Through the implementation of IOT, digitalization, and ICT, achieving sustainability in waste  management is becoming more possible, reliable, tra nsparent, efficient, and optimum in the  industrial revolution 4.0 era. IOT and ICT applicat ions can help reduce the time and resources  required to provide better performance of waste man agement toward sustainable and smart systems  . Therefore, the use of IOT, digitalization, and ICT in  waste management is an interesting pursuit because it brings more economic, social, and  environmental opportunities for waste businesses. S mart waste management  presents an automatic,  integrated, and connected system and provides great  economic opportunities for municipalities,  waste industries, and the community in the fields o f collection ,  segregation , and treat ments (e.g., recycling, remanufacturing,  reconditioning) .  However, there are several challenges faced by Indo nesia in achieving sustainable and smart waste  management. Those challenges include financial supp orts, technical capabilities, political  conditions, institutional capacities, and social is sues (Aprilia, Tezuka, & Spaargaren, 2013;  Damanhuri, Handoko, & Padmi, 2014; Hanifrahmawan Su dibyo et al., 2017). In these cities, waste  management cost is high, while the revenue or incom e/profit gathered from the waste management  process is low. An ideal framework should provide a  better solution that represents higher economic  value by optimising waste management and treatment technology and facilities.  The other  challenge is a lack of information and data about r eal waste management cost requirements as they  apply to their processes and technologies.  Further more, the amount of waste sent to landfills  increases the cost of waste management. A secondary  challenge is the lack of technically-skilled  local people and government staff who can practice effective and efficient waste management and  treatment. The quality of the waste itself, because  it is mostly mixed dirty, is another challenge for   Indonesian waste management. If the waste is mixed and dirty, it requires special treatment to  separate the various components and to make them re ady to be processed.   Therefore, it is important to apply waste collectio n activities in the beginning process of waste, at  the source. In addition, the availability of an int egrated, clear, and transparent waste management  process and sufficient information are both critica l elements to achieve ultimate value and to  minimise the cost of the waste management system. A nother objective of the waste management  system is to improve the population’s social perfor mance and the community by reducing the  impacts of waste. Social impacts include the desire  to minimise the decline of the environment, and  to improve the cleanliness and health of the commun ity, to augment conservation efforts, and to  provide labour opportunities for employment. The hu ge amount of waste sent to landfills shows that  community awareness of the importance of waste redu ction is still low. In addition, the work  opportunity given to scavengers  oft en risks the health and safety of that individual  due to lack of waste facilities. Greater attention to health and safety issues, and more informed  participation and cooperation from citizens and the  public is needed to make waste management  socially viable. Good governance plays a key role i n smart waste management. However,  implementing sustainable waste management requires participation from both political and other  official stakeholders. Appropriate regulations, tec hnology selections, ICT and infrastructure  development, and effective waste management operati ons need local and national government  participation and coordination.   A fundamental framework of the circular, sustainabl e, and smart waste management is developed  through the value chain process of waste management . That circular process (use, selection, sorting,  technical recovery, biological recovery, energy rec overy, and landfill) (Kannan et al., 2020;  Govindan et al., 2020b) is illustrated in Fig. 1. T he four dimensions of governance, economic,  social, and environment become the drivers in the f ramework. Information and data management  through IOT and ICT intervention is located at the centre of the system. Internet of things , a  new generation technology, is applied in this syste m for information and data integration, sharing,  and connection in the waste management value chain.  The concept of IoT consists of local sensing,  data integration, analytics of things, and cognitiv e action. In the area of waste management, the IoT  could provide track waste identification in real ti me. Connected devices allow for the tracking of  products, components, and materials, and that promo tes efficiency in recovery and reuse of the  waste.       Fig. 1.  Fundamental framework of Sustainable and Smart Wast e Management System  Fig. 1 shows how the ICT and IOT are designed as th e core of the waste management system. The  waste management system is integrated through the e stablishment of appropriate IOT and IOT  infrastructures, in which some automatic technologi es are adopted to improve the productivity and  efficiency of the waste system. The ICT and IOT sol utions should be uniquely aligned with social,  economic, and environmental aspects and they should  maximise the benefits of the system.  Details of the framework and each aspect are elabor ated below. Also explained is how these aspects  relate to each other, and a categorization of the l evels of their sub-aspect. Each dimension has  several subdimensions that has different characteri stics as presented in Table 1.    Table 1: Sustainable / Smart Waste Management Dimen sions  Dimension  No Features – sub dimension  Infrastruct ure, facility  Governance 1 Use of information and communication  technology for collecting, sharing, and  receiving waste data   Radio, telephone, newspapers, mobile phone,  website portal system, forum, apps - local to local ,  local to national government    2 Community participation through a Suggestion box es, community feedback website

Determining Maturity levels   In this section, a maturity level is  a set of stru ctured levels from the lowest level to the highest level  which describes how good the government, organisati on, business, community and technology  manage waste from five points of view including gov ernance, social, economy, technological, and  environmental dimensions. Each dimension has severa l components as illustrated in the following  section. Governance dimension - There are three maturity levels differentiated in t he Governance  perspective: low, mediocre, and advanced. Low gover nance refers to a basic governance  performance which is characterized by an unforced l egal waste management system, and the society  is not involved in the public waste management syst em. Mediocre governance is considered  adequate or average performance; generally, one fin ds contemporary values and practices of public  waste management in existence. Advanced governance is the way waste management is managed in  the highest-level organizations. Advanced governanc e works coherently, with discipline and  accountability, and it involves participation from all stakeholders. Social dimension - Social  dimension is strongly related to people, their life  and interactions which are an essential part of th e  sustainability of waste management. The social dime nsion considers five maturity levels: legal,  organizational, technological, management and proce dure, and human competency. Legal waste  management is operated under institutional and lega l processes by the local government and it is  based on national regulations and policies. The org anizational level demonstrates that waste  management is operated by an organization with a fo rmal structure, which has goals at the level  strategic to be achieved. The technological level r efers to the implementation of technology to boost  labour productivity of waste management. Management  and procedure shows how the workflow in  the waste management process operates. The fifth ma turity level in the social dimension consists of  human competencies. Waste management occurs due to the work of a set of labourers or skilled  people with specific characteristics; their skills enable the efficiency of the system’s job  performance. Economic dimension – Three maturity levels, including slow, fast, and ad vanced, are  present in the economic dimension. A slow economy p revents or hinders the receipt of economic  value or benefits from the waste management busines s process. When economic values decrease or  stagnate, business processes tend to be unprofitabl e. A fast maturity level refers to a real, verifiab le  growth in the waste business which can be measured.  An increase in investments in the waste  management business contributes to a healthy econom ic development, and an increase in the labour  force, technology, and human capital are reasonable  expectations. The advanced maturity level  refers to highest level of economy performance avai lable in the system. This waste management is  more developed and features advanced technologies, infrastructure, and facilities. Importantly, an  advanced economy waste management system is able to  significantly transform waste into valuable  money. Technological dimension – Technology has three maturity levels: common, varie ty, and  diverse. Common technology is known, easily availab le and commonly used in waste management.  Variety means that the technology or system applied  in the waste management has different types,  categories of collection, transportation and treatm ent technologies. A diverse technological level is  the highest level of sustainability and it shows a great deal of variety; these technologies are  different, specific, and unique in some certain pro cess.  Environmental dimension  –  Environmental has three maturity levels: low, mediu m, and high. A low maturity level means the  environmental impacts are seriously affecting human  and environmental performance. Medium  means there are environmental impacts but also that  some preventive and curative actions have  been taken.  High maturity means there are few or z ero human and environmental impacts. Fig. 2  presents the multi-dimensional sustainable smart wa ste management.    Fig. 2. Multidimensional Sustainable and Smart Wast e Management Framework    In addition, we identified five maturity stages of waste management including traditional, common,  organised, integrated, and smart, all of which are scored in Table 2. The maturity level of the waste  management will depend on the score assessment whic h was adjusted for relevant intervals based  on the scale linkers used in this study. A waste ma nagement will be categorised or ranked as  traditional if it scores 30-42; common if the syste m scores 43-57, organised if it ranks 58-72,  integrated with a score between 73-85, and smart fo r ranking 86-102.     Table 2: Score card of the maturity levels  Score/Dimension Traditional Common Organised Integrated Smart  Governance  5 - 7 7 – 8  9 – 10  11 – 12 13 – 15  Economic  7 – 9  10 – 12  13 – 15  16 – 18  19 – 21    Social  6 – 10  11 – 14   15 – 19 20 – 24  25 – 30   Environmental  7 - 9 10 – 12  13 - 15 16 – 18  19 –  21  Technological   5 - 7 8 – 9 10 – 11  12 – 13 14 – 1 5  Total  30 – 42  43 – 57  58 – 72 73 - 85 86 – 102     The stages are determined based on the performance of the governance, economic, social,  environment, and technological aspects of the syste m. These five maturity stages are outlined in the  following section. 

Level 1 – Traditional: The traditional waste management system involves li mited facilities and  technology with minimum machinery and automation. I t is mostly manually operated, and no  standard process and procedure exists. Regulations are applied at the very basic standard to meet  government requirements, and there is little partic ipation from the community and citizens. Further,  there is a lack of communication between municipal departments. The ICT investment is limited to  the use of SMS alerts for waste data confirmation; there is a lack of skilled workers, a lack of  regulation compliance, and no communication channel s between departments. Key approaches for  reaching a higher level include stakeholder identif ication and involvement, management  improvements that focus on technology applications,  and building a citizen and community base.    Level 2 – Common: The  waste management is addressed to meet waste regulat ions with a primary  focus on accessibility to the collection process; w aste management is set to be semi-automatically  operated. There is communication between department s to handle the waste; however, there is still  a lack of coordination between stakeholders. ICT ap plications are used for basic communication,  and regulations drive the waste management process.   A minimum number of skilled workers are  employed. Key directives for achieving a better was te management system are grounded on  changing community behaviour and cultures, implemen ting basic automatic machinery and  technology, complying with minimum regulations, imp roving basic communication channels and  augmenting environmental awareness. Finally, improv ing awareness of policies and regulations,  and adding relevant information on waste management  system, processes, and procedures is  needed.   Level 3 – Organised: The  waste management has an efficient, streamlined, eff ective waste process,  with average skilled workers, total regulation comp liance, established communication channels  between department, some community participation, a nd some participant/management levels  demonstrated in the environmental awareness of empl oyees. Key approaches to augment an  organised system should focus on improvements in co mmunity behaviour, knowledge and skills of  waste workers through both formal and informal educ ation, promoting worker productivity through  automation and improved monitoring, ICT investments , a website to disseminate and to promote  waste management activities and to share pertinent information such as pick up services and new  regulations. The expected level of the current wast e management performance in the four cities is  organised, since  smart cities, including those wit h smart environments, have achieved the  integrated level.   Level 4 – Integrated: This waste management system is modern and is align ed with the behaviour  of the people; this system is comprehensively and i ntensively integrated to reduce global waste.  This system employs standard skilled workers, opera tes beyond regulatory compliance, presents a  high level of communication and transparency, and i nvolves all management levels in a culture that  values environmental awareness. Key approaches here  rest on collaborating or contracting with the  recycling industry, changing management structure, data integration, and boosting community  engagement and participation.   Level 5 – Smart: The smart waste management system is globally conne cted through the entire  system. Waste treatment values are considered in de cision making, automatic technology and  systems are employed to achieve efficiency, waste d ata and information are integrated in big data  centres using IoT systems, workers are highly skill ed, the community is naturally involved,  insurance or other initiatives are available for he alth, hygiene, and safety occupations, the system’s   compliance style is founded on self-regulation, all  information is available real time, and all  personnel are committed to a culture of environment al awareness.     Instead of multiple dimensions, the waste managemen t system has several different characteristics  including dynamic, unique, adaptive, flexible, and integrated:   a.  Dynamic - waste management constantly changes in te rms of its content, volume and  location; however, they have capacity to dynamicall y manage the changes.    b.  Unique - Even though the waste management system ha s many things in common, but  SWM may have uniqueness and creativity in managing the waste from one place to another.   c.  Adaptive - The degree of technology applied to SWM may differ, but it remains adaptive to  change.  d.  Flexible - The waste management can be easily modif ied to respond to altered  circumstances and sustainability requirements. Tech nology and IOT are partially used as the  inter-operability communication tool.  e.  Integrated - The maturity level of all aspects reac hes the highest level, integrated waste  management systems, automatic and high-tech technol ogy, IOT and big data are used to  integrate the system.    The following Table 3 interprets waste management c haracteristics based on their maturity level.

The waste management  dimension of the Indonesian urban cities shows diff erent performance levels. Governance aspects  present  good performance of the regulations, guidelines, an d standard operational procedures to  follow on waste management and of the availability of interaction channel between community,  government, and industry. However, negative perform ance is found on the  use of information and  communication technology for collecting, sharing, a nd receiving waste data, community  participation through a system which collects commu nity voices, easy access to government  funding, and transparency and accountable investmen ts for waste management.

Maturity level of current waste management sys tem  Despite positive maturity levels that exist in the governance, social, and economy dimensions of  waste management, the maturity levels in the enviro nment and technology dimensions are still at a  low position. Fig. 3 shows the data gathered from t he survey conducted in the urban cities which  assesses the environmental aspects of the waste man agement. Ultimate amount of wastes processed  recycled and composted is far from the threshold va lue. The other aspects including waste  management value change and carbon emission of proc ess still have low level. These issues cause  the waste management to produce high environmental impacts which negatively degrade not only  the ecosystem but also risk human health and life.  Therefore, the waste management stakeholders  and Indonesian government need to take an innovativ e approach to improve environmental  conditions. They need to work effectively and effic iently on the waste process, recycling, and  treatment at the onsite waste operations and waste supply chains. The investment into infrastructure  and facilities is also critical to be improved in o rder to optimize waste treatment and to reduce  hazardous emissions.     Fig. 3 Maturity level of the waste management syste m for environmental aspects    Fig. 4 illustrates the technological maturity level s of the current waste management. The maturity  level that use appropriate technology, apply ICT an d IOT, implement automated technologies and  efficient energy consumption are still at a low lev el. Essentially, the use of automation and ICT  plays a critical role in achieving sustainability o f economic, social, and environmental aspects of th e  waste management. Therefore, the Indonesian Governm ent needs to invest more in innovative  technologies to improve waste management practices in Indonesia. In addition, improvement of  knowledge and skills of the labour force in order t o maximise the use of technologies is urgently 

required.         Fig. 4  Maturity level of the waste management syst em for technological aspects    4.2. New design of Sustainable and Smart Waste Mana gement   According to the global assessment of the waste man agement, it appears Jakarta has the highest  maturity level in comparison with other cities. Tab le 5 shows the performance of the waste  management in the four cities. Threshold value is t he total value in which each feature in the  dimension reaches the  optimal value.  Table 5.

Therefore, to   understand how the framework is applied in the wast e management system, a sustainable and smart  waste management design focusing on the business pr ocess and system workflow of the final  disposal centre is developed and presented in the f ollowing section.     4.3. Business process in Final Disposal Centre  The business process is the preliminary design of t he proposed waste management system,  presenting a sequence of waste flow in a waste mana gement system, separating waste based on  some characteristics including size, metal/non-meta l, light, inert, and combustible etc., grouping the   waste material and making decisions for the appropr iate treatment technology.  This phase involves  a preliminary design of the proposed system, by dev eloping a waste classification system (sorting  systems) based on waste type and characteristics in  a sequenced waste flow. The sorting systems  that consist of filters are developed via standard methods of waste classification, presented in Fig. 6.  0510 15 20 25 Governance  Economy  Social Environment Technology threshold  Jakarta  Magelang  Semarang  Yogyakarta    Fig. 6  Business process of the proposed system   The 1st filter is a waste sorting system that disag gregates the waste into large size materials and  small size materials through a semi-manual, automat ic system. The semi-manual system applies  labour work and sensors to separate the dangerous m aterials , bottles and glass  materials, and quilt and cloth materials. A rotatin g screening machine separates the materials into  large-sized materials and small-sized materials. Th e 2nd filter is a waste sorting system which  disaggregates the non-metal and metal materials for  both large-sized materials and small-sized  materials through different belt conveyors using a magnetic separator. The system uses the belt  conveyors for subsequent operation from filter to f ilter. The 3nd filter disaggregates remaining  waste material into three materials, including ligh t materials, inert materials, and combustible  materials using wind separators and belt conveyors.  The 4th  stage is a collection phase based on  material characteristics, in which all separated wa ste materials are grouped and shifted into differen t  waste compartments/bins and wait for the choice of further treatment. Following this stage, the  system determines the appropriate treatment technol ogy which is technically, economically,  environmentally feasible for the specific waste mat erial. The possible treatment technology could  be recycling, composting, incineration, incineratio n, gasification, landfill, etc. Information  communication technology  and Internet of thin gs  components are integrated in the  system to collect, analyse, and share the informati on system during the system processing. The IT  devices such as sensors, microcontroller, equators,  low-power connectivity are used to provide all  waste management process, information, and performa nce of the waste management system. A  software interface includes the embedded applicatio n that is used to support the various functions of  the system, and a web server and database and a das hboard will be developed for better analysing 

and reporting. This system is expected to be able t o measure the waste level, content, volume,  characteristics and amount using sensors which are presented in the dashboard system. This system  will have three main features which are sensing, mo nitoring, and optimising the waste management.  By using this dashboard, real time monitoring, bett er decision making, and appropriate treatment  technology can be provided by the company to achiev e economically, socially, and environmentally  sound waste management.     4.4. System Workflow at Final Disposal Centre  This system is addressed for municipal waste produc ed from household waste, shops and markets,  construction areas, hotels, institutions, street sw eeping, and so forth. The system will start with th e  flow of “invaluable” municipal waste produced by th e city community and sent to final disposal  centre by a compactor truck that has a barcode on i t. This barcode not only identifies the truck, but  also provides information such as company name, sou rce of waste, and type of waste. Once the  truck enters the arrival pit, a sensor reads the tr uck barcode and sends the truck identity informatio n  to a database. The truck is then scaled using a wei ght scale that is connected to the company  database through a local area network. The weight o f waste will appear on the dashboard. The truck  dumps the municipal waste into a storage pit that i s embedded to the system.     A mechanical machine  will take the waste into manual sorting platform  through belt conveyors for first sorting process wh ich is conducted by labourers to sort dangerous  materials, bottles, large glasses, and cotton and c loths for recycling purposes. The materials from  this first stage sorting are collected in certain b ins with weight sensor on it. The waste that  remai ns  on the conveyor is sent to a bag breaker  to break open the refuse bag. The  broken bag waste is fed into the rotate screen  that is designed like a  tub with specific dimensions. In this hole the wast e is separated into different sizes (large or small   sizes). Large-sized materials are expected to be mo stly plastic, stone, textile, rubber, while the  small-sized materials are expected to be mostly org anic waste. The small size material is collected  by the small collecting belt conveyor and transferr ed by the small transfer belt conveyor to the  small material storage for further processing or la ndfill.     During this process, the magnetic separator has sep arated the iron/metal materials in the small  materials.  The large-sized material has the same p rocess with small-sized materials process on  different belt conveyors. After separating the iron /metal by the magnetic separator, the large  materials  are sorted out, and the remaining waste is transferred  into the wind separator by belt conveyor. The wind separator will be designed by a combination of  positive and negative pressures which can efficient ly separate the waste into three materials,  including light materials , inert m aterials  and  combustible materials . The inert material s  and combustible materials will be transferred by be lt conveyor to the inert materials and  combustible materials storage that are utilised wit h a weight level sensor. Useful elements will be  identified through a sensor in the sorting platform  and they are then sent through a conveyor into a  storage bin for further treatment. The useless mate rial is collected in a specific bin and then sent t o  landfill. The light materials will be transferred t o the storage bin and then packed into mass  materials which are easy for storage and transporta tion.     Each of the storage bins includes a weight level se nsor which will send information to the database.  All information related to the waste flow process i n the system will be sent and recorded in the  database. The database will provide possible treatm ent technology according to the performance of  the waste collected and available treatment technol ogy. A feasibility analysis of the economic,  social, and environmental benefits will be provided  to help in the decision making. For example, the  collected plastic is possible to be converted into carbon black, fuel oil, and combustible gas through   pyrolysis, while inert materials such as muck, rubb le, construction debris, ashes, brick, and stone  can be used for making brick. Composting is also po ssible to be applied from the biomass, garden,  food waste, and animal, while collected metal can b e tagged for recycling. Finally, the hard plastic,  textile, rubber materials, wet paper materials can be used for combustion. The following Fig. 7  presents the waste flow, data flow, and logical dec ision making of the proposed system.        Fig. 7 Workflow Design of the Sustainable and Smart  Waste Management System 

The proposed system presents some fundamental agent s including information on the truck, weight  scale, collection and segregating room, conveyors, hazardous bins, tumbler, heavy materials  compartment, light material compartment, final wast e material bins accomplished with specific  attributes, and procedures. The agent truck has spe cific capacity with a standard weight. The agent  truck has a barcode identifying the company name, d river, source of waste , and waste  type. The agent weight scale measures the weight of  the waste truck, and a sensor placed at the  entrance will help to identify the truck informatio n from the barcode. The information is sent to the  database of the waste collection centre. The agent conveyor will transfer all waste from the  segregating area to next station. Manual filtering process for hazardous materials will be conducted  by labourers during the transfer process. Unpacked waste is filtered and returned to segregating  facility, for reprocessing/repacking. Hazardous bin s are used to collect the dangerous materials. The  bins have sensors which measure the level of the wa ste, in which the waste information will be sent  to the database. The waste is then sent to agent ro tating screening machine, agent bag breaking  machine, agent manual platforms, agent magnet separ ator, and agent wind separator. The sensor  will help to provide sufficient data and informatio n of the waste to be further processed  .    Furthermore, a web application is used to deliver a ll information and data of waste flow, input,  process and output from the web page to the desktop  or mobile device. The illustration of web  application  is presented in Fi g. 8. The dashboard provides the overall status of  waste management including the flow process of wast e, amount and weight of waste collected, the  total materials collected, the compartment’s status   for each process, the facility map   showing the status of the compartments, the suitabl e treatment technology for the waste collected,  and the amount of waste residue sent to landfill.

  4.5. SDGs Potential Achievements  This work contributes to at least five potential Su stainable Development Goals  out of  seventeen goals. Details of the achievement of thos e five goals created from waste management are  described below.      SDG 3 - Good health, and wellbeing.   A good, clean, and healthy environment is an essent ial component of sustainable development  globally. In recognition of this concern, SDG 3 can  be achieved through the following.   /checkbld The proposed smart and sustainable waste management  system is one innovation that has potential  solutions to solve the issues of waste management i n the community and industry. The ability to manage   waste properly and to conduct waste treatment appro priately in the proposed waste management system  offers direct and indirect advantages to the good, clean, and healthy environment of the global  population, which would generate a significant cont ribution to sustainable development.     SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation  A strong interrelation exists between waste and wat er in the waste management system. This new  waste management system uses various treatment tech nologies to transform waste into valuable  materials and resources, which could significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill. The  reduction of the toxins, residues, emissions and po llution created from waste could correspondingly  reduce the water contamination in the land.     SDG 8 - Decent work and economy growth  Instead of working unofficially, a lot of waste man agement workers (i.e., scavengers, waste  collectors) are underpaid, have little education, a nd are not properly protected. Such unsafe  conditions seriously endanger their lives, health, and social condition. Most of them are among the  poverty-stricken in Indonesia. This new system prov ides low-income people a better wage, more  respect, and a better social life by involving them  as an important contributor to a formal waste  management system. Through such a system, this work er group will be designated as part-time  employees of the Government, and their economic per formance will be strengthened.     SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production   One of the SDG targets is reducing pollution, emiss ions, waste through waste prevention, reduction,  recycling, and reuse. This new system offers approp riate, automated, and integrated waste  collection, separation, and treatments which could significantly reduce these environmental  problems.     SDG 13 - Climate action   Optimising waste collection, segregating waste at t he source, applying appropriate treatment  technology, and reducing waste headed to the landfi ll are essential activities. These actions allow  waste to be controlled and monitored, and using ICT  and IOT in this system will reduce CO 2  emissions generated from the waste. This solution w ill help mitigate aspects of climate change.     In short, when SDGs are achieved, not only are envi ronmental aspects improved, but economic and  social aspects are also enhanced.       Conclusion  In this article, we present a new waste management system that is an essential part of our  ongoing research objective, to design a smart waste  management system to implement a sustainable  circular economy. According to maturity level of th e existing waste management system in four  urban cities in Indonesia, a sustainable and waste management framework and sustainable and  waste disposal system was developed. By using the I CT as the core of the system, this system finds  the capability of existing performance in waste man agement, in which real-time, smart, flexible,  and reliable waste management performance and infor mation covering governance, economic,  social, and environmental dimensions can be achieve d. At last, this study contributes to the  sustainable development goals such as Good health, and wellbeing ; Clean water and  sanitation ; Decent Work and Economic Growth  ; Responsible Consumption and  Production  and Climate Action . Th e use of ICT and IoT improves the  efficiency and effectiveness of the waste managemen t system, despite having some technical  challenges such as limited type of sensors, complex ity of system, and limited mechanical  technology, all of which are to be overcome before product development. Future research is to  improve validity and reliability of the instruments  for data gathering. The number of characteristics  used in this study is only 30, so more criteria is expected to be added to strengthen the classificati on  of waste management maturity levels, and to improve  the determination of thresholds. More  samples of case studies with a variety of character istics will be applied to test the consistency of t he  classifications. The potential achievement of SDGs through the implementation of the waste  management need more comprehensive study including industrial sharing economy (Govindan et  al., 2020c).
