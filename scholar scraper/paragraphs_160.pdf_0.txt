chapter the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands annemiek v errips sander hoogendoorn krista jansemahoekstra and gerbert romijn abstract production of plastic has grown enormously to over megatons in and will continue to increase in the future most important environmental damagecaused by plastic is pollution especially the plastic soup and the emission of co which causes climate change the depletion of natural resources oil and gas is not considered to be an important issue in relation to plastic because in the long run less oil and gas will be used worldwide due to the upcoming of sustainable energy oil and gas supplies will be sufcient for the production of plastic for several years at the moment the environmental benets of recycling household plastic are limited it provides no solution to reduce plastic soup or littering co reduction is limited to about of total co emission in the netherlands increasing recycling of household plastic will not automatically increase environmental benets in this stage augmenting quality of recycled plastic is to be preferred over increasing the amount the government could subsidise innovation in this matter and stimulate thequality of recycled plastic in a nancial way enterprises could alter their strategy by using plastics that cause less problems in recycling the use of biobased plastic which refers to plastic made of biomass is no solution in the eld of plastic soup aboutthreequarter of all biobased plastic used worldwide is not biodegradable above this for bioplastic to be biodegradable you generally need an industrial environment biobased plastic can reduce co but net results vary widely due to side effects on the environment possible measures to reduce littering and plastic soup would be extending the packaging depositrefund system regulation with respect to plastic in cosmetics innovation in removing plastics from wastewater and measures to reduce plastic in organic waste which is turned to

education for sustainability  a v errips et al introduction the circular economy and the policies on the circular economy aim to reduce the use of natural resources promote reuse and recycling and reduce waste production inorder to reduce the ecological footprint of human activity the underlying reasoning is that human activity is depleting the planet both with respect to natural resources and the habitability of the physical environment cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis studies the economic aspects of a circular economy and related policies in doing so it looked at the impact of the circular economy on social welfare this concept principally includesall matters important to human beings and also those for which there is no market or market price eg nature safety landscape environment this publication provides a welfareeconomic overview of the circularity of plas tics from raw materials to waste plastics are used a lot worldwide and their use is still increasing in addition the use of plastics comes with substantial environmentalproblems plastics therefore are also one of the priorities in the governmentwide programme for a circular economy by the dutch ministries of infrastructure and water management and economic affairs and climate ministries of infrastructureand water management and economic affairs and climate in relation to this analysis all authors visited two organisations a vr a wasteprocessing plant and suez a company that collects separates and recycles waste the aim of theseworking visits was to obtain information from people working in the eld and to experience the process of burning and recycling of waste ourselves useful informa tion received on the recycleability of several plastics on nonusable waste and ondifferent techniques of separating waste the purpose of this analysis is to outline the main aspects of the circular economy of plastics in order to provide a number of perspectives for policy and policymakerssection describes the main ndings from the analysis section contains the policy implications that follow from the analysis the closing section provides the conclusions sect findings worldwide use of plastics is greatly increasing since the s the global use of fossil fuelbased plastics has increased fold ellen macarthur foundation the use of plastics has thus increased much more rapidly than the global gdp oil and natural gas provide the resources for theproduction of fossil fuelbased plastics socalled virgin plastics the use of such this paper is published in dutch v errips et al a an indepth analysis is provided in v errips et al b the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands virgin plastics is projected to increase from mt today to around gt by the largest share of plastics used in the netherlands is for packaging around in addition large amounts are also used in construction around mainly in theform of pvc consumer goods and passenger vehicles alternative ways of producing plastics concern the use of biomass bioplastics and recycled plastics recyclate the global share of bioplastics is currently around in the netherlands around of plastics are produced from recyclate depletion of resources for the production of fossil fuelbased plastics will play a minor role in the coming decades between and of the total demand for oil and natural gas is for the production of plastics as resource and as fuel increasing the sustainability of the transport and industrial sectors is likely to lower the general demand for oil and natural gas in such a case there would be plenty of oil and natural gas available for the production ofplastics for hundreds of years to come there are also technical possibilities for using a larger share of the oil and natural gas stocks in the production of plastics however production costs would increase as hydraulic fracturing or fracking becomes moreexpensive as larger shares of oil and natural gas are used in plastics production questions about the security of supply concern two main points of consideration the rst is whether sufcient resources would be available and to what extent weare dependent on countries on whom we would perhaps rather not depend the other point concerns the prevention of large price shocks that would have a backlash on the real economy these points are related a welldeveloped world market for acertain resource means that there are many competing suppliers and customers who are able to secure their mutual current and future trade positions via liquid nancial markets this does not completely rule out price shocks but will make them less likely however if market access for suppliers is restricted markets are small few transactions or supply is noncontestable in other ways the slightest rumour maylead to price peaks and market panic whereby countries will close their markets or use their market power oil and natural gas production are spread all over the world a decline in the demand for oil as a result of co taxation together with the emergence of alternatives would decrease the global market for oilproducing countries in such a case oil would increasingly become more of a resource instead of a fuel the price of plastics is far less volatile than that of oil this rst and foremost suggests that there are more factors determining the costs of plastics production in addition to the price of the primary resource moreover the production of plastics isspread all around the world in that sense there seems to be a welldeveloped market for plastics sourcing guaranteeing supply thus appears less of a strong argument for reducing the use of oil and natural gas in the production of plastics a v errips et al damage to the physical environment is the most important external effect an important external effect relates to litter which has a negative impact on the land scape nature and the environment a fair amount of this litter consisting largely of packaging will end up in the oceans plastics disintegrate into socalled microplastics which can damage human and animal health the socalled plastic soup is a major environmental problem that is still increasing another source of microplastics in dutch waters besides litter is wastewater these microplastics for example are released when clothing is washed or they originate from plastics in cosmetics furthermore rainwater contains wear particlesfrom tyres microplastics from the wear and tear of paint rubber granules from arti cial grass on soccer elds and plastics from compost that is based on biodegradable waste a recent study by the wur speksnijder shows that the arctic ocean also contains large amounts of microplastics these microplastics could accelerate the melting of the ice caps and thus speed up the impact of climate change moreover theyare located in an area of relatively large biodiversity an analysis of ocean currents reveals that these microplastics originate particularly from northwestern europe the external effects of the plastic soup therefore have a large international component for that reason the solution to this problem requires collaboration between countries co emissions of producing recycling and burning of plastics another large external effect is the emission of co of all the emissions related to the production of plastics co is by far the most important component in the netherlands plasticsrelated emissions of nitrogen oxide no x sulphur dioxide so and particulate matter pm in europe are relatively limited because of the implemented emission standards the most important emission is co followed by particulate matter mainly from production processes in certain countries outside western europe co is emitted not only during extraction and production processes but also during incineration and recycling some of the co emissions are included under the emissions trading system ets however not all countries are involved the production of plastics in for example china and the united states is not part of the ets nor does the etsinclude co emissions from the incineration of plastics in wasteincineration plants in the netherlands of residual waste consists of plastics waste incineration in such plants is also used for generating heat and electricity if this heat and electricity had been generated in another way this would have involved the emission of co the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands in the current energy mix these socalled avoided emissions form around onethird of the co that is emitted during the incineration of plastic waste possibilities of bioplastics solving the plastics problem are only limited bioplastics do not seem to be a viable solution to the problems of litter and plastic soup because they are only biodegradable to a limited degree currently only a quarter of these plastics are biodegradable those that are mostly require an industrialenvironment of heating in order to biodegrade this therefore will not happen to bioplastics that end up as litter is there anything to gain in terms of lower co emissions from the production of bioplastics the answer strongly depends on the type of biomass used and the location in which it is grown production is less efcient than that of using fossil resources oil palms are the most efcient crop species in terms of land use and co reduction but this type of cultivation involves deforestation an alternative would be the use of sugars as the resource for bioplastics this reduces co emissions as well as the risk of negative impacts on nature compared to using vegetable oils in addition the negative effects on the environment of the amount of water that is needed in the cultivation of biomass must also be taken into account as well as the emission ofacidifying compounds and nitrous oxide a very strong greenhouse gas related to the use of articial fertiliser the external effects of biomass production are potentially large the amount of land required to produce bioplastics from biomass is relatively large and because land is scarce there is also competition with food on the basis of price ratios with nature landscape and biodiversity and with the demand for energy it is uncertainwhether the increasing demand for biomass can be fully met by technological devel opment increasing the production per hectare and by second and thirdgeneration biomasswhich involves the use of more waste ows limited options for the application of recycled plastics given current t echnology current techniques cannot fully separate plastic waste into homogenous ows of individual types of plastic for this reason the largest part of the plastic waste from households after sorting currently consists of mixed materials with a low and some times negative market price called mix and for a small part of more homogenousows of one type of plastic some of the mix is being exported but a limited part is stored or ultimately incinerated the situation for regranulate originating from homogenous ows is more positive there are more applications for this material a v errips et al and it has a higher market value yet price levels are still below those of virgin plas tics this is partly caused by the lower quality that results from imperfect separation methods regranulate from homogenous ows also has its limitations with respect toapplication possibilities these limitations refer to regulation around additives and food safety and include the fact that certain plastics retain the odour of the original product recyclate will be more competitive under higher oil and natural gas prices and higher co prices nevertheless the limitations of the application possibilities for recycled plastics under the current state of technology still determine their lowmarket price t echnological development is crucial technological developments may for instance improve the quality of regranulate and reduce the cost of recycling it is debatable at which pace developments will take place and to what degree certain barriers in practice could also be overcome with new techniques an example of a new technique is chemical recycling during which the original resource material is reextracted this could potentially removeimportant limitations in applications but currently still involves high costs and a high use of energy it is as yet unclear whether this process will ultimately result in environmental gains technological development is also very important for other forms of circularity one example is ecodesign through which it is easier to recycle products or to extend the lifetime of products and concepts earlier cpb research noailly shestalova shows that from the viewpoint of social welfare the market is not investing sufciently in innovation in sustainable technologies compared to the innovation investments in existing techniques policy implications this cpb analysis concerns an inventory of the circular economy of the plasticsvalue chain from the perspective of welfare across the board the analysis does not include possible comprehensive policy options in this area the advantages and disadvantages of those options and the related societal costs and benets there is already a large number of policy measures in this eld on european national and municipal levels european policy for example sets targets for the amount ofresidual waste national policy includes for example subsidies and regulations and municipal policy is about the system of waste collection furthermore certain policy involves an important role for industry such as the covenants that are held by thepackaging waste fund nevertheless the ndings generally indicate what would be possible promising and less promising policy options for the netherlands the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands the analysis reveals that the most important external effects related to plastics are caused by litter and the plastic soup as well as by co emissions below a concise description is given of policies that would address these effects to lesser or greaterdegrees the description is not exhaustive an analysis of the costs and benets of such policy requires additional research reduced use of plastics lower co emission levels and less w aste less use of plastics also means less litter therefore less plastic material in the oceans and fewer co emissions ideally the external effects caused by production use and waste of a certain product should be incorporated into the price for example throughtaxation the idea is that such taxation leads to fewer of these polluting products being bought thus to lower consumption levels and partly to a shift towards alternative products and technologies examples of such taxation are the waste collection and processing rates the collection and recycling of plastic packaging in the netherlands are funded from thepackaging waste fund this fund is nanced by packaging companies in the fund incurred around million euros in costs of which around million was for the collection separation and recycling of waste around threequarters of thisrelates to plastic packaging this causes an increase in the costs for the producers of packaged goods which in turn provides them with an incentive to reduce the amount of packaging they use or to switch to a substitute material these costs are partlyincorporated into product prices and therefore are ultimately paid by consumers higher prices lead to consumers buying fewer packaged goods in this way some of the external effects of the use of plastics may become internalised in the productprice this analysis has not looked at tax levels costs behavioural effects or the impact of such taxation on the welfare of society the external effects that are related to plastic products vary according to the type of plastic and its application in addition it is very difcult to estimate what the consequences of the use of plastics will be for the plastic soup taxation may lead to the substitution of plastics with other materials but those are likely to have their own impact on society and the environment a shift from plastics to other materials will therefore not necessarily lead to environmental benets another way of reducing the amount of plastic used would be through regulation which obviously includes a task for the government the industry itself may also enter into covenants and agreements incentives for entrepreneurs to do so includeregulations and cost saving through taxation but may also be driven by how they would like to be perceived by consumers sustainable image and corporate social responsibility furthermore education and information provided to companies and consumers may increase awareness and reduce the negative effects related to the use of plastics a v errips et al policy related to litter and plastic soup plastic soup is an international problem that to a large extent calls for internationally coordinated policy at the same time as the netherlands also adds to the plastic souplitter and plastics in the water are also a national problem expanding the depositrefund system is a type of policy that directly helps to pre vent litter and thus also reduces the plastic soup over ninety per cent of plastic litterconsists of packaging expanding the depositrefund system provides an incentive for users to collect litter instead of discarding it into the environment the ban on free plastic bags offered in shops is likely to be effective in reducing litter there arealso other types of policy aimed at litter prevention such as expanding the cleaning capacity for public spaces and enforcing and sanctioning antilitter regulation as well as providing adequate waste containers in public areas to prevent litter being blown about litter is an important source of the plastic soup but not the only source gov ernment policy could also contribute to combatting other sources with respect to regulation this would possibly mostly be in an international context eg to counter the use of plastics in cosmetics articial grass granules end up in the environmentvia rainwater runoff regulation could be a viable policy option here another start ing point is the stimulation of innovation in order to improve techniques for ltering plastics out of wastewater eg caused by washing textiles the pollution causedby plastics in biodegradable waste that ends up in the environment via compost is discussed later in this section the netherlands could also contribute to reducing the amount of plastics in the oceans by stimulating innovation and more directly by helping with the cleanup the dutch initiative the ocean cleanup of boyan slat may successfully contribute to solving this problem question marks around intensifying the recycling of separated and sorted plastic w aste it has been found that currently most of the plastic waste that is being separated from household waste consists of a mix that has a low market value due to substan tial application limitations a greater effort in relation to the recycling of plastics for instance by stricter regulation about the maximum allowed amount of residualhousehold waste will lead to an even larger ow of product with such limited appli cation possibilities this may then lead to stock formation or to the already separated waste being incinerated after all a share of the dutch mix nds its way to germany where it is used in the production of lowquality products while germany ce delft has studied the costs and impact of a number of variants for expanding the depositrefund system ce delft the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands incinerates part of its own mix with energy recovery v an der heijden this negatively affects the environmental benets recycled plastics from homogenous ows know a broader range of applications but also have their limitations for example those related to odour and food safety such limitations are likely to be reduced through technological development in sep aration techniques as well as by regulation or agreements within the industry aboutthe use of certain types of plastics additives and colouring agents nevertheless this will be no easy feat because of the many different types of plastics and additives that are needed due to product characteristics and preconditions around food safety more focus on quality rather than quantity according to the netherlands institute for sustainable packaging kidv and thepackaging waste fund the quality of the recycled plasticsand therefore also their application possibilities and the price could already be improved using currently available techniques slowing down the sorting process could improve separation and thus achieve a smaller share of lowquality mix as well as yield a mix of higher quality this would increase processing costs though current nancial incentiveshowever are only aimed at the highest possible output with the precondition of a maximum of mix instead of the highest possible market value the packaging waste fund pays a xed tariff for waste collection and separation municipalitiesfocus more on quantity because of their objectives to reduce the amount of waste per inhabitant organising the set of instruments with a greater focus on quality could improve the environmental benets of recycling plastic waste this couldbe included in this years framework agreement on packaging raamovereenkomst v erpakkingen an alternative could be to impose a ban for the netherlands or the eu as a whole on for example black plastic packaging andor other types of packaging that cannot be recycled easily or a covenant by which companies commit to increasing the recyclability of their packaging reducing residual w aste leads to greater risk of polluted biodegradable w aste a source of the plastic soup an additional effect of focusing on the amount of residual household waste is that it increases the chances of polluting the biodegradable waste although data are notavailable the trend appears visible in everyday practice at wasteincineration plants biodegradable waste is turned into compost plastics in compost in the netherlands is a source of the plastics that end up in surface waters a v errips et al effect of plastics recycling on co emissions is limited with respect to the effort t aken there appears to be no direct relationship between the separation of plastic waste by households and a reduction in litter or plastic soup recycling of plastics is therefore not the solution to these problems as stated above the availability of resources forplastics offers a few starting points for government policy on this subject recycling of plastics does lead to a lower emission of co as an indication of the co reduction resulting from a specic policy to enhance consumer recycling of plastics a rough calculation was carried out in this reduction on an annual basis was between and tonnes of co which equals of total co emissions in the netherlands around megatonnes or for example less than of the co emitted by road trafc in the netherlands this seems like a modest result in comparison to the size of the measure reuse repair extending product lifetime and ecodesign reuse repair extending product lifetime and ecodesign products that are designed in such a way that they can be reused or recycled more easily are possible solutionsto reduce the demand for plastics and thereby also reduce the amount of plastic waste furthermore a shift from ownership towards utilisation by consumers eg in the sharing economy may also lead to a decline in the use of plastics the policy aimed at solving the primary problems resources or waste could lead to an encouragement of these business models as a solution however this is beyond thescope of this study and requires further analysis bioplastics quality criteria for co reduction and side effects bioplastics may contribute to a reduction in co emissions the co benets vary greatly depending on crop type and location the required biomass is in competition with food energy and nature the degree of land use is potentially large and there are certain side effects eg nitrogen phosphates and water research by ce delft shows that quality criteria may be helpful in ensuring the environmental benets from lower co emission levels and in preventing as many negative side effects as possible such as those on nature this would be a task for national or international governments the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands stimulating the t echnological development of sustainable t echnologies is v ery important finally it is important to note that many of the limitations that are mentioned above are a snapshot in time based on the current state of technology the government is able to make a contribution towards reducing negative environmental effects involvedin the use of plastics by stimulating innovation through subsidies green deals andor scal measures this is necessary due to the suboptimal bias towards polluting tech nologies subsidies would accelerate the protability of sustainable energy tech nologies as well as removing the innovation bias acemoglu aghion bursztyn hemous this may provide innovative sustainable initiatives from within society with the nancial scope they need in order to become established enterprises conclusions the reasons for making the plastics value chain more circular include their claim on scarce resources environmental pollution during resource extraction and production of plastics and the pollution caused by plastic waste plastic soup litter wastedisposal and incineration the main impact is that of environmental pollution this publication gives an overview of the plastics value chain providing insight into the problems described and suggesting policy options the main conclusions are production volumes of plastics over the past years have increased more strongly than global gdp this trend is expected to continue over the comingdecades the depletion of fossil resources for plastics production oil and natural gas will play only a modest role over the coming decades as the global sustainability ofthe transport and energy sectors will leave sufcient oil stocks for the production of plastics for a few hundred years to come moreover also the security of supply of oil and natural gas is unlikely to play a major role in the debate around theproduction of plastics the use of plastics involves external damage particularly as a result of envi ronmental pollution the plastic soup littering and co emissions particulate matter emissions no xand so x have in western europe been effectively cur tailed through regulation bioplastics and the recycling of plastics form only a limited alternative to the fossil fuelbased production of plastics a bioplastics made of biomass are not expected to be the solution to the problems of litter and plastic soup b there is a certain benet with respect to co emission reduction but this is set against an intensied claim on natural and agricultural land a v errips et al intensifying the separation of plastic household waste for recycling under cur rently available technologies is not very promising from a welfare perspective separating plastic waste in households does not solve the problem of litter orplastic soup most of the recycled plastic waste consists of mix a mixture of different types of plastics and foils for which the application possibilities are only limited the market price of the foils and mix is low and sometimeseven negativethe latter because discarding them costs money recycling plas tics from separated household waste is currently still very expensive the costs of collection and processing of this mix are therefore substantially higher than themarket price which is mostly determined by its limited application possibilities as well as by the low price of primary plastic oil price and co price increased recycling for example due to a greater focus on the amount of residual wasteper household is expected to lead to an even larger ow of a product with limited market possibilities this in turn may lead to stock formation or to incinera tion of the already separated waste material which has a negative impact on theenvironmental benets recycling provides no solution to the problems of litter and plastic soup and at this point only contributes to co emission reduction to a limited degree the quality of the recycled plastics and thus the application possibilities could be expanded by improving the currently available sorting techniques however thiswill make processing more expensive current nancial incentives push towards the highest possible output though instead of the highest possible market price organising the instruments to have a greater focus on quality could improve theenvironmental benets of plastic waste recycling this should be studied more closely a side effect of a focus on the amount of residual household waste is that this increases the chances of polluting other waste ows such as biodegradable waste plastics in compost in the netherlands is a major source of the plastics that end up in surface waters and thus ultimately in the plastic soup expansion of the depositrefund system is a type of policy that directly links to the prevention of litter and thus to a reduction in the dutch contribution to the plastic soup over of plastic litter consists of packaging expansion of thedepositrefund system provides users with the incentive to collect waste instead of discarding it into the environment the question of whether the related benets would outweigh the costs was not considered in this study government policy may also contribute to combatting other sources of the plastic soup for example in the eld of regulation possibly mostly in the international context eg banning the use of plastics in cosmetics or articial grass made of car tyres other areas would be stimulating innovation to improve techniques to lter wastewater eg to remove particles from washing textiles and reducingthe pollution of biodegradable waste the question of whether the related benets would outweigh the costs was not considered in this study the main conclusions above were drawn from an analysis based on the current state of technology technological developments could for example improve the quality and reduce the costs of recycled plastics the government may contribute the circular economy of plastics in the netherlands to this process by stimulating innovations through subsidies green deals and scal measuresanother option would be to internalise the external effects into taxesthis last point may provide innovative sustainable initiatives from within society with the necessary nancial scope to achieve full development
