The results of the interviews and composition analysis support
ﬁndings from previous research that a signi ﬁcant number of busi-
nesses are still failing to meet their legal Duty of Care requirements
and that there is widespread use of household services. Only 70% ofbusinesses had a contractor in place for residual waste and 50% a
contractor for recycling. 27% of businesses openly stated that they
used household services for residual waste and 38% for recycling.
6.2% of the waste sampled from the household stream was found to
be from businesses. The implications of these ﬁndings are re ﬂected
on below.

£835 million was spent by local authorities on waste collection and
a further £2.0 billion on waste disposal ( Department for
Communities and Local Government and National Statistics,
2016 ). The composition analysis showed 6.2% of the household0 1 02 03 04 0CostsLack of suitable servicesLack of space Staﬀ meDecisions made elsewhereLack of staﬀ/management commitment Not a business priorityWe do not produce enough …
