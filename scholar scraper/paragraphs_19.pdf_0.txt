received in revised form july accepted july available online july editor damia barceloaround a third of food is wasted globally requiring signi cant resources for its treatment and disposal in addition to wasting valuable resources following the circular economy principles this waste should ideally be avoided and if not possible treated to recover resources this paper con siders the life cycle environmental and economic implica tions of recovering energy and material resources from food waste focusing on the uk situation four treatmentmethods are considered anaerobic digestion invessel composting incineration and land lling the results show that per tonne of waste treated anaerobic digestion has the lowest environmental impacts in out of the cat egories considered in the study includi ng netnegative global wa rming potential invessel composting is the least sustainable option environmentally in contrast to being pr eferred over incineration according to the circular econ omy principles incinerati on has the lowest life cycle costs t while land lling is the costliest option t managing the mt of food waste collected annually from uk households via the four methods generates t co eq and costs m in addition to causing a numb er of other environment al impacts however it also saves pj of primary energy primarily due to electri city generation through incineration if all of this food waste was incinerated m and t co eqyear could be saved compared to current waste management rendering incineration a carbonnegative technology this would also result in savings in other impacts butwould increase summer smog by and metal depletion by the environmental bene ts of incineration would be exceeded only if all food waste was treated by anaerobic digestion which would save t co eqyear and produce more electricity per tonne of waste than incineration anaerobic digestion would also lead to savings in other impacts compared to the present situation but would result in a four timeshigher acidi cation and three times greater emissions of particulate matter in addition it would save myear compared to the current costs nevertheless prevention of avoidable food waste would realise far greater environmental and economic savings estimated here at mt co eq and bn annually the authors published by elsevier bv thi s is an open access article under the cc by license

sources is receiving increasing global attention gustavsson et al the total production value of global food waste fw is esti mated at trillion increasing to trillion when social and economiccosts are considered fao and the greenhouse gas ghg emis sions associated with the fw supply chains account for of global emissions fao the world bank in their sustainable de velopment goals sdg the united nations have stated a target to half the percapita food waste at the retail and consumer levels by un the issue of food waste is also becoming pertinent in the eu with the growing pressures to implement a circular economy ec in the uk the food industry has already agreed to reduce food and drink waste across the whole supply chain but the target set through the voluntary courtauld commitment wrap b i s not as ambitious aiming only for a reduction between and food waste reduction ts into the uks wider environmental com mitment to the eus nationally determined contribution ndc of a reduction in ghg emissions by ec a n dt oi t ss e l f s e tt a r g e t for net zero emissions by uk government within the eu the majority of fw is generated by households with an estimated mt disposed of each year stenmarck et al in the uk household fw reached a total of mt in quested and parry following a campaign to reduce household fw a re duction had been achieved between and quested et al b but the trend has since been reversed with a increase in fw from to at present more than half of the uk household fw is land lled or incinerated with the rest treated by anaerobic diges tion ad composted or used as animal feed although these methods help to deal with existing waste while at the same time recovering en ergy and resources they also generate additional environmental im pacts and economic costs the circular economy principles emf as well as the waste management hierarchy defra a f a v o u ra da n dc o m p o s t i n g over incineration and land ll however their environmental and eco nomic sustainability will vary depending on many factors including the composition and volume of waste as well as the geographical region where it is generated and treated this is re ected in previous studies which considered the sustainability of treating fw in different coun tries whose ndings on the preference of different treatment methods differed depending on the location for example oldeld et al undertook a national life cycle assessment lca study for ireland assessing the global warming eutrophication and acidi cation poten tials of fw treatment via ad invessel composting ivc incineration and land lling in comparison with waste minimisation they found that ad had the lowest impacts of the three treatment options for all three environmental indicators but the difference between ad ivc and incineration was small when compared to waste minimisation which was the best option the bene ts of waste minimisation were also discussed by beretta and hellweg who showed that a reduction in fw in switzerland would lead to a lower climate change impact bernstad and la cour jansen also considered the ad ivc and incineration but for a swedish town focusing on ve impacts global warming acidi cation ozone depletion photochemical oxidants for mation summer smog and nutrient enrichment their results sug gested that ad resulted in the greatest reduction in global warming and photochemical oxidants formation but both ad and ivc increased nutrient enrichment and acidi cation in comparison to incineration an lca study based in seoul showed that producing wet animal feed from household fw by sterilising and mixing with corn starch had the greatest savings in global warming potential compared to land lling and composting kim and kim for a review of studies in other countries see bernstad and la cour jansen some studies of the life cycle costs lcc of fw management have also been carried out to evaluate their economic sustainability for in stance in the follow up to their abovementioned lca study kim and kim kim et al assessed the lcc of the same treatment routes in seoul and found that wet feed also had the lowest life cycle cost when compared to dry feed land lling composting and ad two other lcc studies on consumer fw management carlsson reich martinezsanchez et al focused primarily on methodology and included only brief case studies for danish and swedish systems in a wider study martinezsanchez et al estimated lcc of all fw generated in denmark and found incineration had marginally lower costs than either codigestion or conversion to animal feed via the source separation of plantderived food waste when both direct and in direct costs were considered however the study focused primarily on the large savings possible if avoidable fw was prevented as far as the authors are aware there are no lca and lcc studies of fw management for the uk apart from one lca of household fw man agement in a london borough evangelisti et al and another on incineration and land lling of municipal solid waste msw at the uk level jeswani and azapagic no other studies exist therefore this paper presents for the rst time the life cycle environmental im pacts and costs of the four household fw management routes currently used in the uk ad ivc incineration and land lling the aim is to iden tify environmentally and economically the most sustainable options placing them in the context of a circular economy following the con cept of the latter the treatment methods are also compared to the avoidance of food waste the outcomes of this study will be of interest to local authorities policy makers and consumers the next section details the lca and lcc methodologies applied to evaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of fw treat ment along with the assumptions and data used in the study the re sults are presented and discussed in section and the conclusions and recommendations in section methods the lca study has been completed in accordance with the iso standards iso a iso b the lcc methodology is based on guidelines published by swarr et al andhunkeler et al which is consistent with and complementary to the lca methodology the following sections detail the goal and scope of the study methods used for the estimation of environmental impacts and costs and the inventory data goal and scope the goal of the study is to estimate the life cycle environmental im pacts and economic costs of the current household fw treatment sys tem in the uk this comprises ad ivc incineration with energy recovery and land ll with utilisation of land ll gas lfg as all the methods recover either energy andor material resources the aim is to identify the most sustainable option within the context of a circular economy a further goal is to compare the sustainability implications of food treatment with waste avoidance when comparing the treatment methods the term food waste re fers to any edible or inedible fractions of food discarded by households this is further de ned as avoidable possibly avoidable and unavoidable fw quested and parry when prevention is considered only the avoidable and possibly avoidable fractions are considered as preventable the scope of the study shown in fig encompasses fw collection from households its treatment by one of the abovementioned methods and recovery of energy andor materials including the related environ mental and revenue credits construction of the treatment plants has also been considered but their decommissioning and the resulting pc slorach et al science of the total environment waste are excluded the environmental impacts of fw are also ex cluded ie the fw is considered burdenfree the functional unit is de ned as the treatment of tonne of house hold food waste with recovery of resources these results are subse quently scaled up to the annual amount of household fw currently collected in the uk estimation of life cycle impacts and costs the lca impacts have been estimated following the hierarchist rec ipe impact assessment method goedkoop et al in total impacts are included in this method all of which are considered in ad dition primary energy demand has also been estimated using the method in gabi v thinkstep the latter has also been used for lca modelling and estimation of the impacts an uncertainty analy sis has been carried out using the monte carlo method with sim ulations for each treatment method assuming a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum values of the inventory data the lcc have been

congruence with the lca methodology which does not consider the im pacts associated with labour inventory data and assumptions the primary inventory data have been obtained from operators of the treatment plants and supplemented from literature background life cycle inventory data have been sourced from the ecoinvent database v ecoinvent further details on the data are provided below uk household food waste management the amounts of kerbsidecollected fw treated by different disposal methods have been determined based on local authority data collated in the database wastedataflow and annual reports produced by the national governments of the uk the results are summarised in fig food waste disposed to the sewer homecomposted or fed to livestock is outside the scope of this study for a full breakdown of all household waste including fw see table s in the supplementary in formation si as can be seen in fig the majority of fw is embedded in msw of which mt is land lled and mt incinerated annually approxi mately of uk households have a separate food waste collection and have food waste collections comingled with green waste wrap a in total mt of fw are collected separately and mt are comingled with green waste there are no de nitive gures for the nal treatment of these waste streams but they are split between ad and ivc for the separatelycollected fw it is assumed that mt is sent to ad in accordance with estimates by burns et al the re maining mt of separately collected fw and all fw comingled within green waste mt are assumed to be treated at an ivc facility as woody plant matter is not suited to ad thus the total amount of fw collected by local authorities either separately or comingled with other waste is estimated at mtyear food waste composition and value the composition of household fw is not homogenous and will vary across different locations and at different times of the year a study in wales esteves and devlin took summer and winter samples from local authorities and analysed their elemental composition the resulting average data are presented in table s in the si and are as sumed to be representative of uk household fw all carbon is assumed to be of biogenic origin this composition has been used for incineration and land ll however for ad and ivc it has not been possible to model the complex biological process for a speci c composition and therefore average composition values for foodderived biogas digestate and com post have been used instead as detailed further below to estimate the implications of waste avoidance two fw fractions are considered avoidable suitable for human consumption and po tentially avoidable eg potato peel and bread crusts waste their vol umes have been estimated at mtyear and mtyear quested

a and hence it has only been possible to es timate the global warming potential of avoiding these two fw fractions their shelf value cost to consumer has been determined using average cost data from uk family food datasets defra b and scaled up to the total household fw of mtyear quested and parry waste collection the fw is collected by a conventional municipal waste lorry t which has been modelled using ecoinvent for an average dis tance of km other distances km are considered as part of the uncertainty analysis the collection costs have been estimated using a local authority kerbside costing tool wrap a sample of different local author ities has been taken to represent a national average with different costs considered for urban mixed urbanrural and rural populations as well as for different levels of economic deprivation it has been assumed that there are fortnightly collections of residual waste and a weekly col lection of separated fw the average costs for fw and msw collections have been weighted based on the mix of household types in the uk table s waste treatment the model for each treatment method is representative of the mix of facilities operating in the uk as discussed next in the base case the av erage values provided below have been used across the treatment op tions with the minimum and maximum values considered in the uncertainty analysis anaerobic digestion the life cycle of the ad system fig a com prises waste collection construction and operation of ad and chp plants to generate respectively biogas and electricity and application of digestate to agricultural land the excess electricity exported to grid has been assumed to displace uk grid electricity for which the system has been credited system credits have also been applied for the digestate which replaces an equivalent amount of mineral fertilisers the heat is used to maintain the reactor temperature and to destroy pathogens in the digestate uk government as there is no mar ket for excess heat from ad plants scholes and areikin no credits have been applied for the heat the inventory data summarised in table have been obtained from a number of operating and pilot scale plants within the eu the average data have been used in the base case with the minimum and maximum values considered in the uncertainty analysis food waste is a compo nent of the feedstock at all plants but not the exclusive feed the major ity of ad plants in the uk have singlestage mesophilic c reactors scholes and areikin the representative plant used in this study has a capacity of tyear over a year lifespan and operates using a highsolids msinglestage mesophilic digester the biogas is assumed to be methane and carbon dioxide ecoinvent it is utilised in a mw chp reciprocating internal combustion engine to supply all onsite demand with the excesselectricity exported to the grid the chp plant produces kwh elec tricity and kwh heat per tonne of fw methane losses are assumed to be equivalent to of the total biogas produced bernstad and la cour jansen evangelisti et al naroznova et al both ammonia and nitrous oxide are gen erated during the ad which are also considered ecoinvent the composition of the digestate table s is based on the analysis of digestate from multiple uk ad plants processing fw rigby and smith as can be seen the nutrient content of the digestate ranges widely which has been explored in the uncertainty analysis the quantities of fertilisers displaced by the digestate have been esti mated based on the mass of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium phos phorus and potassium have an equivalent uptake ef ciency compared to mineral fertiliser but the uptake of nitrogen ranges from to bernstad and la cour jansen in this work the nitrogen up take and emissions are based on uk eld results for the application of foodderived digestate with the results shown in table nicholson et al the ammonia and nitrate emissions that would occur fol lowing the application of ammonium nitrate have been included in the credits applied for displacing the mineral fertiliser nicholson et al found that the average nitrous oxide emis sions from digestate application ranged from to of the nitro gen applied the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc assume a default value of for all nitrogen fertilisers de klein et al while harty et al have found nitrous oxide emissions from application of calcium ammonium nitrate to range from to while these results show that it is likely that nitrous oxide emis sions from digestate are lower than those of ammonium nitrate due to the uncertainty they have been modelled as equal and no credit has been applied an overview of the lcc data for ad is provided in table the capital costs of the ad plant have been estimated
