Handling editor Cecilia Maria Villas B oas de Almeida Keywords Circular economyWasteRecycling Governance TextileDemolitionabstract Designing circular economy policies and planning approaches in cities is an emerging research eld and the aim of the present paper is to contribute to the existing body of literature by analysing multiple governance forms whereby municipalities can support and facilitate a local level transition to a circulareconomy The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse how cities and municipalities can support and facilitate the circular economy through multiple modes of governance eg through the use of own assets to support the circular economy the use of the ownership of utilities and waste companies to supportthe circular economy the use of rule enforcement andor economic regulation or through facilitatingcoordinating collaborating and encouraging The analysis in the article is based on two indepth case studies of projects seeking circular economies in which Danish municipalities collaborated with local stakeholders to close the material loop for demolition materials and textile waste Overall this study isbased on an action research approach that emphasises the bene ts of coinnovation processes carried out between multiple stakeholders The analysis of the case studies concluded that municipalities can function as an important change agent to support and facilitate a transformation towards a circulareconomy Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Introduction Increasing pressure on resources and concerns about environ mental impacts and climate change Steffen et al UNEP are prompting companies and governments to search for strategies to deliver sustainable development The circular econ omy is regarded as a promising concept for policymakers European Commission and businesses WBCSD t o close the material loops in consumption and production systems Over the last decade the circular economy concept has attracted increasing attention as a framework to understand and guide businesses and policymakers Bocken et al Ghisellini et al Korhonen et al However the central idea about ma terial cycles and resource limitations has existed since the begin ning of industrialisation Desrochers The origin of the CE concept can be traced back to theoretical contributions from Boulding on the spaceship economy to later contributions from the limits to growth report in the s Meadows andto the industrial ecology Erkman Frosch and Gallopoulos and the cradletocradle Braungart et al literature Also the urban perspective on closedloop systems as illustrated by the urban metabolism concept helped inform the creation of the development of the CE concept Bolger and Doyon The role of cities and urban systems has therefore been a central part of the CE concept since its early days Circular economies in cities There exist a wide variety of de nitions of the circular economy Blomsma and Brennan characterised the circular economy concept as an umbrella concept that is used as a broad heuristic to develop strategies and policies at different scales from global production and consumption systems to cities and municipalitiesKirchherr et al identi ed no less than different de ni tions of the circular economy and also found that circular economy denitions most often relate to the R framework reduce reuse recycling and recover This CE framework has strong connotations to the waste hierarchy which is used as a steering principle to rank most desirable waste policies in the EU Waste Framework Directive

Production EC Since all EU member states must adhere to the Waste Framework Directive it is unsurprising that the circular economy activities in Europe have a strong bias towards this de nition of the circular economy At its core the circular economy concept has two main inter linked aspects namely the circular ows of physical materials the material aspect and the economy of these ows the economic aspect The material aspect has to do with the creation of closed loop ows This involves ows of raw materials intermediate products nal products plus the services they provide the use of the products and the management of the products as waste in the linear system or semiclosedloop systems or as raw materials for the production of new products in the circular economy The ma terial aspect also involves the energy use associated with these ows and the environmental issues that the ows may cause as the materials run through the economy The Ellen MacArthur Foun dation EMF and McDonough et al Braungart et al divide material ows into two main types technical and biological ows The EMF butter ymodel which can help illus trate biological and technical material ows has become widely used by policymakers and academia The butter y model tends to focus on the waste ows of endoflife products and their pathways back into the production system by reuse or recycling However the model pays less attention to how byproducts and waste are interchanged between companies in the production system Such a perspective is provided by the industrial ecology literature which emphasises the processes by which materials from one company can be used as raw material by another company Clift and Druckman The economic aspect of the circular economy has to do with the economic costs and revenues generated as materials ow through the economy the business models that are deployed Bocken et al and the regulation and legislation that constitute the eco nomic framework conditions for the businesses Several studies have indicated that the transition to a circular economy opens up opportunities for the development and adoption of new ways of generating revenue and with this new business models Bocken et al WBCSD Very often circular economy systems are characterised by a complex relationship between the private sector and the public sector where the public sector not only provides the framework conditions but also takes an active role in creating partnerships and support systems to facilitate the transition to a circular economy The role of cities in the circular economy With around half the world s population living in urban areas cities are a main contributor to environmental problems resource consumption energy use and GHG emissions UNEP Wang et al While on the one hand cities often have higher per capita consumption cities on the other hand also often exhibit higher resource ef ciency per unit of income and thereby provide a great potential for ef ciency UNEP The UN Global Envi ronment Outlook forecast increasing future urbanisation andargues that this development if managed poorly would be associ ated with high risks but also that the urbanisation trend has a potential to contribute positively to helping solve environmental problems and to reducing resource consumption if local govern ments can manage to develop and implement technologies that due to economies of scale would be unfeasible in rural and less densely populated environments UNEP Many cities are today strongly involved in circular economy activities Bernhardt et al identi ed examples of city level circular economies in diverse cities across the globe covering topics such as citywide circular strategies urbanrefurbishment public procurement utilities and municipal waste A number of pioneering cities such as Amsterdam and Glasgow have used material ow analysis methods to identify their main resource ows and to target projects and policies accordingly There are several reasons why cities and local governments can play an important role in the transition to a circular economy First most cities and local governments are responsible for or at least heavily involved with the management of waste They are thereby positioned at the end of the linear material ows and are responsible for managing the massive amounts of waste that are produced in the economy and therefore they have a natural in terest in the fate of these ows In most countries local govern ments also must meet recycling targets and they are therefore naturally involved in circular economy activities The task of handling waste ows in cities has increased over time and is ex pected to increase further both in volume and importance with the growth in urban populations across the globe The UN estimates that twothirds of the global population will live in cities by UNDESA putting a massive strain on local governments to handle and recycle material ows Second circular economy activ ities overlap with many other policy objectives that cities typicallyalso have to deal with eg energy water transport and air pollu tion For instance waste management has strong linkages to climate change mitigation as many waste ows are treated in waste incineration plants municipal solid waste or biogas plants organic waste from industries and households Circular economy activities also impinge on sustainability plans such as Local Agenda plans or SDG city plans The economic aspect of the circular economy also has an in uence on many economic policies at the city level such as employment policies business support and entrepreneurship policies Third cities and local governments often act as a strong bridge between citizens and private sector organi sations Cities and local governments often act as facilitators that can enable collaboration between stakeholders from the private sector knowledge institutions and citizens The degrees to which municipalities engage in such activities differ from country to country and even between municipalities within the same country In countries such as the Netherlands and in the Nordic countries Finland Sweden and Denmark there is a wellestablished tradi tion of municipalities engaging with companies knowledge in stitutions and citizens and acting as a facilitator to bring parties together and to drive action Christiansen et al Local governance of the circular economy The research on circular cities often focuses on developing in dicator systems to assess monitor evaluate and compare circular economy initiatives at the city level Gravagnuolo et al analysed the CEs among a group of selected port cities to eval uate their criteria and indicators for achieving a CE Wang et al studied CEs among Chinese cities and developed an indi cator system to evaluate and monitor the CE progress at a city level Marin and De Meulder Marin and De Meulder studied urban circularity in four selected city initiatives with an emphasison the spatial design dimension of urban circularity PetitBoix and Leipold reviewed circular economy activities in cities across the globe and found a wide geographical representation of cities engaged with circular economy activities across the globe with particular concentrations clustered in Europe and China The cir cular economy activities identi ed by PetitBoix and Leipold covered a broad range of strategies but primarily targeting infra structure industry consumption and urban planning Obersteg et al analysed the CE using a PESTELO method in a comparative study of six European cities with public sector involvement in CE initiatives and found a lack of policyTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production coordination between the levels of government a lack of horizontal coordination between cities and a lack of public sector coordination and support for private CE initiatives The current CE literature on cities and municipalities can be divided into two primary lines of research The rst line of literature focuses on developing indicator systems to monitor and evaluate the CE at a city level Avdiushchenko and Zaja The second line of literature aims to compare and identify the similarities and differences between projects sectors and initiatives that are the targets of cities in CErelated activities Bolger and Doyon Gravagnuolo et al Obersteg et al However less attention is given in the literature to exploring how cities and municipalities collaborate with stakeholders to accelerate the development of a CE and further research on municipal and city level governance is required to accelerate the transformation to a circular economy Consequently this article aims to contribute to closing this knowledge gap Cities and local governments can play an important role as change agents to create sustainable cities Bulkeley and Betsill Bolger and Doyon conducted a comparative study of the cities of Malm o and Melbourne to analyse how municipal planning could support the transition to a CE and found that stra tegic urban planning could function as a vehicle for the trans formation of CE objectives into speci c actions In attempting to understand how the role of a strategic planner and change agent unfolds scholars have moved from focussing on hierarchical topedownoriented commandandcontrol regulation often labelled government to a perspective focussing on non hierarchical modes of coordination and decisionmaking termed governance Bulkeley and Kern CorfeeMorlot et al Zvolska et al Bulkeley and Kern studied the role of municipalities in climate change mitigation policies and developed a typology for local governments whereby actions could be divided into four main modes of governance as described below This ty pology based on the four roles can be applied to other areas of municipal planning as well although the speci c character of the four modes of governance may differ In a study of the sharing economies in four Swedish cities Palm et al extended the typology by adding governing by partnership however this could also be characterised as a subform of governing by enabling Cavicchi et al used the same framework to analyse sustainability and bioenergy development in Emilia Romagna Italy Based on Bulkeley and Kern this paper applies the following typology for the modes of governance Selfgovernance d ened as the capacity of a municipality to govern its own assets and activities This mode of governance is often described as governing the municipality as a company focussing on activities that take place within the legal bound aries of the municipal organisation Governing by provision d ened as governance through the provision of services and resources This mode of governance often involves governance through municipalityowned agencies and companies in for example wastewater utilities heating companies transport companies and waste companies Governing by authority d ened as governance using authority such as regulation This mode of governance involves govern ing through rules and enforcement including direct and eco nomic regulation rules taxes tariffs etc but also through planning activities that are legally binding on companies and citizens Governing through enabling dened as governance through facilitating coordination collaboration and encouraging This mode of governance can take many diverse forms spanning from formal partnerships to informal community engagementThe distribution of authority between the levels of governance varies from country to country and the potential for municipalities to engage in for example legally binding planning activities or to govern by authority may be quite different Scandinavian countries have a tradition of a deep distribution of power to local governments The purpose of the present paper is to explore how cities and municipalities can combine multiple modes of governance to support and facilitate a local level transition from a linear economy towards a circular economy in which physical ows are looped back into the production of new products and services The analysis in this paper is based on two indepth case studies of Danish mu nicipalities working in collaboration with local stakeholders to close the material loops of two targeted waste streams The rst case study explores the recycling of textile waste while the second case study explores a circular economy in the construction and demolition eld The case studies are discussed in detail followed by a discussion about how municipalities can support and facilitate the transition to a circular economy using different modes of governance Local governments in Denmark A report from the Nordic Ministers Council Christiansen et al focussing on circular economies in municipalities in the Nordic countries identi ed a broad variety of projects and activities targeting the circular economy stretching from smallscale projects with a few partners to largescale intermunicipal projects Like most Scandinavian countries the political system in Denmark distributes relatively large autonomy to local govern ments municipalities compared to the political systems in many other countries Denmark is divided into regions and munic ipalities The regions main obligation is to manage healthcare hospitals and psychiatry services whereas the municipalities have a broad spectrum of responsibilities This also implies that the central government and the municipalities are the most important government levels for promoting circular economy activities In Denmark the municipalities are the primary level of governmentinvolved in waste management with the overall responsibility for all household waste The municipalities must adopt waste plans that cover four years and point years into the future Addition ally Danish municipalities usually hold joint ownership of waste management companies which operate the recycling stations in Denmark as well as the Danish combined heat and power waste incineration plants This ownership relation provides an oftenused opportunity for governing by provision Methods This article presents the results from a multistakeholder co innovation project called Partnership for Circular Municipalities that was undertaken in the Capital Region of Denmark The purpose of the partnership was to support demonstrate and develop therole of local governments municipalities in promoting the tran sition to a circular economy through partnerships between mu nicipalities waste companies and knowledge institutions The project was nanced by Regional Council Development Funds The consortium comprised ve municipalities Bornholm Copenhagen Albertslund Rudersdal and Hrsholm three waste companies BOFA Vestforbrnding and Norfors and three knowledge institutions Roskilde University the think tank CONCITO and Gate Four demonstration projects were carried out as part of the projectTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production Recycling construction and demolition waste Promotion of a circular value chain in the textiles industry with a combined focus on the recyclingupcycling of textile waste and the green public procurement of reused textiles Direct recycling and upcycling of waste fractions Circular business development focussing on resource ef ciency To increase the competences and knowledge of the circular economy among staff in the municipalities three masterclasses were conducted in the project focussing on the circular economy in municipalities circular public procurement and circular organisations Finally the project intended to anchor the circular economy concept strategically and politically in the participating organisa tions This was accomplished through a series of meetings with decisionmakers in the participating municipalities through the establishment of an advisory board consisting of decisionmakers in local municipalities and through the development of a commu nication strategy for the project This article presents the results of two of the demonstration cases that were conducted in the project namely the textile case study and the construction and demolition case study Table This article analyses these case studies to show how local govern ments can combine multiple modes of governance to facilitate a transition towards a circular economy The two cases were chosen for analysis in this article for several reasons both cases involved multiple stakeholders both cases involved coinnovation processes in which multiple stakeholders collaborated towards a common goal and both cases illustrated multiple modes of local governance Bulkeley and Kern The case studies address the two key aspects of the circular economy concept the material aspect and the economic aspect In therst case the material aspect relates to the physical ows of textiles in the Danish waste system and potential scenarios for future ows The economic aspect relates to the costs of these ows In the second case the material aspect relates to the physical ows of demolition materials generated from demolished buildings on the Danish island of Bornholm while the economic aspect re lates to the potential costs and economics related to the recircu lation of these materials Using an indepth casestudy approach the two cases explored how municipalities can contribute to closing the local materials loop and contribute contextualised knowledge about the barriers and potential for the development of a circular economy in these elds Following Gibbons et al the case studies were conducted as a modus type of research whereby the researcher and the local stakeholders collaborate in the production of knowledge Modus research can also be seen as a type of action research which is a research approach that has been used by several researchers for the stu dy of sustainab ility gove rnanceCramer Wittmayer et al The modus approach allowed following an alternative to the classical research approach whereby the researcher could remain an independent observer who collects data to answer research questions derived from academia itself Modus action research involves a collab orative effort in de ning research questions and is based on a multistakeholder approach and coinnovation processes Witt mayer at al Wittmayer et al dene action research as the collaborative production of scienti cally and socially relevant knowledge transformative action and new social relations through a participatory process addressing a particular question formed in the interaction between researchers and other actors thus empha sizing the participatory elements of knowledge production in a joint project with nonacademic partners This research approach implies that the author was actively involved in the initial stages of formulating the aims and targets for the overall project as well as for the individual cases in collaboration with the local stakeholders and in the collection and inter pretation of data as well as being responsible for the nal evaluation of the project as a whole Additionally the overall aim of the present project was twofold on the one hand to generatescienti c knowledge about local governance for transitioning to a circular economy and on the other hand to support a real transition through testing and demonstrating the process The author was additionally involved in the design and implementation of master classes and the establishment of an Advisory Board for Circular Economy in Local Governments with both initiatives established as a part of a larger project but not presented in this article The textile case methodology The textile case was carried out as a collaboration between Rdovre Municipality the largest Danish waste company Vestfor brndingen Roskilde University and a private consultant Affa ldskontoret The project was divided into steps First a collection scheme was established to map and assess the quantity and quality of waste textiles The collection scheme was implemented by Rdovre Municipality for used clothing and shoes Two different collection systems were tested one for onefamily homes and another for terrace homes and highrise homes Textile waste was collected at the doorstep from onefamily homes and addi tionally containers were placed at established collection facilities servicing highrise homes and terrace homes Information folders were produced and distributed to citizens The two different collection systems were chosen since the socioeconomic charac teristics typically differ between highrise homes and onefamily homes Typically collection rates for sourceseparated municipalsolid waste are higher in onefamily homes than in highrise homes Second a scenario analysis was conducted by Roskilde Table Details of the two case studies Textile case Construction case Objectives To identify the potentials for the collection and recycling of textile waste and to explore how a future textile reuserecycling system could beestablishedThe case aimed to close the loop for the ow of construction materials in the Danish island of Bornholm and to bridge the gap between the generation ofdemolition waste and the construction of new buildings Involved stakeholdersRdovre Muncipality Vestforbrndingen waste company Roskilde University and a private consultantBornholm municipality Roskilde University BOFA waste company and two private consultants Main activities Testing a collection scheme for textile waste Scenario analysis Testing predemolition audits and selective demolition to generate data about recycling opportunities and to establish a material bank Assessment of the potentials for recycling construction materials Establishing a recycling network for demolition wasteTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production University to assess the current national ow of waste textiles and to explore future scenarios for the recycling of waste textiles The scenarios were based on a material ow analysis method Brunner and Rechberger where the ows of textiles in Denmark were assessed and illustrated by Sankey diagrams Data for the scenarios were obtained primarily from the Danish Ministry of Environment and an assessment of the potential recycling and reuse technologies mechanical and chemical textile recycling techniques Two scenarios for were generated to quantify the total national opportunities for the recycling of waste textiles in Denmark This date was chosen as the target year since the EU Waste Framework Directive requires the separate collection of textiles from The rst scenario assumed continued increasing textile consumption but with the existing NGObased collection system in parallel with a collection system operated by the municipally owned waste companies Based on the results from a collection test in Rdovre a higher collection ratio increasing from to in the municipal system was also assumed It was further assumed that it would be economically feasible to chemically recycle the poorest quality nd grade and lower collected textiles A sorting test at a private textile collector was carried out during the development of the scenarios to test and validate the existing data on the bre types and the quality of the collected textile waste textiles kg of waste textiles Table Since this quality assessment proved the waste complied with the quality charac teristics provided in the national government data no larger quality assessment was considered necessary The test results were then used to calibrate the assumptions regarding the potential for chemical and mechanical recycling The construction case methodology The construction case was carried out as a collaboration be tween Roskilde University Bornholm Municipality the waste company BOFA and two private consultants The case aimed to close the loop for the ow of construction materials on the Danish island of Bornholm and to bridge the gap between the production of demolition waste and the construction of new buildings To do so three main tasks were carried out a test was made involving predemolition audits and selective demolition whereby three selected buildings were demolished to generate data about recy cling opportunities and to establish a material bank an assess ment was carried out of the potential for the recycling of the construction materials This assessment was based on a series of interviews with local stakeholders in the construction sector The interviews were carried out as semistructured interviews and the results were analysed and documented in a separate background report The results from the qualitative study were afterwards combined with quantitative statistical data on the construction activities on the island which was likewise compiled in another background report a green construction network was con structed The network was established through a series of work shops with local companies in the construction sector This part of the project aimed to convey knowledge from tasks and and to explore the potentials and barriers to transitioning towards a cir cular construction sector Case study recycling waste textiles Textiles are a product category associated with high environ mental impacts throughout the value chain Sandin and Peters The production of natural bres often involves a large con sumption of energy fertilizers water and pesticides During the processing of bres and textiles natural or synthetic the use of energy water and chemicals causes further environmental impactsS ajn The expected increase in textile consumption in the coming years will likely contribute to further environmental problems EMF Textiles are therefore one of the most important ows that cities and local governments across the globe need to address in order to create a circular economy Sandin and Peters Sandin and Peters distinguish between openloop recycling and closedloop recycling where closedloop recycling refers to recycling systems where fabrics or bres are used again to produce new textiles and openloop recycling systems refer to systems where fabrics or textiles are used to produce other prod ucts insulation plastic bottles heat electricity etc The textiles ow in Denmark The recycling of textiles is an area that is attracting increasing attention and so textiles were chosen as a target material ow to assess in this project The upcoming municipal waste plans in Denmark for the period e are expected to focus on increasing textile recycling and at the same time improving the quality of the recycling processes to enable compliance with EU requirements for the separate collection of textiles by ECDirective In this project the potential for the collection and recycling of waste textiles was explored in a collaboration between Rdovre Municipality the largest Danish waste company Vestforbrndingen and Roskilde University The reuse of second hand textiles in Denmark as in many other countries is primar ily organised by NGOs that collect sort and export secondhand textiles to thirdworld countries At the same time some used textiles are shared between friends and family members and a smaller fraction is sold in digital marketplaces Watson et al Approximately of household waste textiles are incinerated together with mixed municipal solid waste Fig illustrates the ow of textiles in Denmark in Here used textiles follow four main routes The largest percentage is incinerated in Denmark t while part of the textiles is reused nationally a large fraction t is collected by NGOs and exported to thirdworld countries typically following transit in Eastern European countries where the textiles are sorted and a smaller fraction is mechanically recycled in Denmark in an open loop mainly for nonclothing products such as cloths Several reports show that there are a number of commercial reuse options for waste textiles in addition to being used as cloths and the like epartly where the bres are recycled in new textiles and partly where the bresclothing are included in other products In addition to presorting there is currently only limited sorting processing and recycling capacities in Denmark The lack of municipal experience with textile recycling and the fact that sort ing and recycling generally take place abroad makes it dif cult for the municipalities to assess the possibilities for a better utilisation of waste textiles The collection test Therst step in the project was to conduct a pilot collection scheme in Rdovre Municipality to assess the quantities and quality of household waste textiles The ndings from the collection test are presented in the Table below Mechanical recycling makes it possible to recycle bres from wornout textiles and future collection schemes under the revised waste plans post will need to collect these fractions as well A general challenge for textile collection in Denmark is that Danish citizens are used to only handing in clothes that they consider as being in good shape eg without holes or not worn out because the current NGObased collection system is set up for reuse in thirdworld countries Citizens therefore need to change theirTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production sorting practice and to be encouraged to hand in wornout clothes along with clothes suitable for reuse Based on the relatively low volumes collected in the test sorting scheme carried out in this project it can be concluded that additional education and infor mation is needed to make citizens change practice Scenarios for the future textile ow with increased recycling To analyse the potential for the increased recycling of textiles in Denmark a set of scenarios was developed based on a baseline projection and variations with increasing the amount of textilesrecycled by mechanical and chemical processes Therst scenario Fig was based on the assumption that the current NGObased system will be maintained while a second scenario was developed to illustrate the potential of a new system whereby all textiles are collected under the municipal system and recycled in Denmark This range was partly due to the uncertainty related to the actual fate of the exported textiles and partly to ac count for the uncertainties related to how these are endoflife treated after reuse land lled incinerated or recycled Scenario C Fig can be understood as a more ambitious and challenging scenario that will require larger changes to be made tothe existing system Because Scenario C is based on a national system it is easier for municipalities to verify that the collected textiles are actually recycled and that the system will create a closed loop where textile bres are continuously recycled and not landlled after being reused once as is likely the case with the exported textiles today The developed scenarios were discussed with the project partnership with representatives from the largest Danish waste company Vestforbrndingen Rdovre Municipality and the two knowledge institutions Roskilde University and Gate in order to clarify the potential future policy options when imple menting the EU Waste Framework Directive requirements for the separate collection of textiles by These discussions concluded that overall political decisions on the structure of the waste system need to be taken especially with regards to the distribution of the roles and responsibilities between private collectors NGOs and the municipally owned waste companies Additionally Rdovre Municipality used the ndings from the collection test to establish and implement a textile collection scheme covering the entire municipality as part of their waste management plan The data for the material ow analysis were quite rough and the scenarios were based on certain assumptions which can naturally lead to signi cant uncertainties The two most important Fig Scenario A Textile ow in Denmark based on data from Danish

textile ow in Denmark Fig Scenario C Ambitious system with the national recycling of textilesTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production uncertainties are related to technological uncertainties about whether the chemical recycling of textiles will be commercially available at a large scale within the target time frame and po litical uncertainties related to whether implementation of a na tional closedloop system is realistic as this would require a signicant change to the current system and in scenario C a showdown with the NGObased collection system Scenarios B and C were included to present and illustrate the potential in two ul timately different systems and to quantify the potential of a na tional closedloop system The scenarios were presented to decisionmakers in the waste company however a nal decision on the structure of the textile recycling system was still not taken The textile case illustrated two main modes of municipal governance namely governance through provision and governance through authority The rst step in the project in which Rdovre Municipality established a pilot collection scheme illustrated governance through authority Here the collection scheme was legally binding and citizens covered by the collection scheme were obliged to follow the instructions communicated and enforced by the municipality The second part of the textile case where Rdovre Municipality collaborated with Roskilde University and the publiclyowned waste company Vestforbrndingen can be regarded as a combination of governing by provision as Rdovre Municipality was also a part owner of the waste company Vestforbrndingen and governance through enabling Case study recycling construction and demolition waste Measured by volume construction and demolition waste CDW is the most signi cant waste fraction in Europe representing approximately onethird of all waste generated European Commission while in Denmark CDW represents of all waste produced CDW covers a broad variety of materials including concrete bricks plastics metals glass and gypsum Despite the potential for the recycling of these materials being promising in the EU only around half is recycled European Commission Furthermore the recycling practices associated with CDW in Europe often result in a downcycling of the construction materials to a lower quality and functionality whereby instead of being looped back into high quality use such as the construction of new buildings highvalue construction materials are used as lowvalue road base and lling materials Di Maria et al As a conse quence of this practice economic value is destroyed and the po tential for increased resource ef ciency and avoided environmental impacts is underutilised Ghisellini et al Silva et al The island of Bornholm was determined to become a test island for the circular economy The municipality had adopted an ambi tious waste strategy called Bornholm Showing the Way eWithout Waste BOFA where it set out its aims to recycle all waste fractions by and to eliminate the need for waste incineration and land ll The case study aimed to support this vision by exploring the possibilities for creating closedloop value chains from the demolition to construction of new buildings in a public eprivate collaboration between the waste sector the mu nicipality as the authority and as a construction client the con struction industry knowledge institutions and citizens Closing the loop in the construction sector is a complex task that requires changes across a diverse group of stakeholders Currently the vast majority of construction materials generated from demo lition is crushed and downcycled to lower value and functionality Therefore changes to demolition practices are needed while at the same time practices among the companies involved in the con struction of new buildings are needed to ensure the demand for recycled construction materials Additionally issues such as the quality including environmental issues durability andcertication of materials need to be handled to allow the recycling of CDW Exploring selective demolition practices Bornholm municipality manages a demolition fund that nan cially supports the demolition of wornout houses mainly in rural areas of the island Priority in the demolition fund is given to buildings that contain building materials and building components with a high conservation value Using the demolition fund this casestudy developed and tested selective demolition practices created a warehouse for demolished construction materials and created links to private stakeholders involved in the construction of new buildings and in the renovation of old buildings that poten tially would be able to use the materials whereby a circular value chain could be established The municipality s use of the demolition fund could be characterised as selfgovernance since the munici pality uses its own assets as a way to in uence the local con struction sector Therst building was demolished in October applying selective demolition techniques and two additional buildings weredemolished in the summerautumn of Environmental screening was performed prior to demolition to identify any haz ardous substances in the materials such as PCB asbestos or heavy metals followed by resource mapping The environmental screening is mandatory according to Danish law for buildings larger than m or if the renovation generates more than ton of demolished materials Danish Executive Order on Waste The resource mapping comprised two categories one category con taining materials for reuse and one category for recycling where additional work is necessary before the materials can be reused Table illustrates the results of the resource screening against the result of the selective demolition from the rst demolition project The selected demolition generated less material for reuse and recycling than anticipated in the resource screening The wooden oors for example turned out to be in less good shape and therefore only mout of the midenti ed in the resource screening were taken out for recycling De ning value from demolished materials A central issue found during the rst resource screening and demolition was the dif culty associated with determining the value of materials In the project the value of the demolished materials was assessed by carrying out an internet search for the prices of similar materials In all three cases a positive business case was identi ed when assessing the potential sales value of the con struction materials against the cost of conducting a selective de molition logistics and storage of materials However assessing the value of materials turned out to be a complex challenge First the value of the construction materials was determined by the quality of the material and the amount of labour costs needed to separate the valuable material from the other materials in the demolition process in order to secure a satisfactory quantity of the demolished material Second a larger quantity makes it easier to attract po tential buyers The value of simple and standardised materials suchrafter bricks tiles and wooden oors was easier to establish than for more complex products such as doors and windows Even a simple product such as tiles may require detailed knowledge to assess their value The rst house that was demolished in the project for example included a special type of locally produced tiles called Hasle tiles that are in high demand when historic shermen s houses are renovated A correct valueassessment during the resource scanning therefore necessitates a detailed knowledge about the local market for construction materials ThisTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production may also be the case for products such as windows and doors where knowledge of the local construction sector is needed to assess the value Looping construction materials back into the construction of new buildings A main task in the project was to bridge the gap between de molition and construction The municipality took an active role in exploring several options Initially the demolished construction materials were handled and stored by the local waste company BOFA in a facility connected to the local recycling station while potential usersbuyers were identi ed The group of potential usersbuyers included local construction markets upcyclers citi zens the municipality itself and professional companies in the construction sector A private enterprise with a business model aimed at recycling used bricks was contacted by the municipality and established a branch of ce on the island A partnership agreement between the municipality and the company was created to make sure that the bricks from the demolition demonstration projects would be treated and reused in the construction of new buildings In these processes the municipality took an active role in establishing contacts with companies that could potentially use the demolished materials and acted as a facilitator To make sure that knowledge about the project and resources were disseminated to local construction companies a network initiative was started by the municipality A mapping exercise was commenced by the municipality to provide an overview of the local construction and demolition sector This activity resulted in two reports Local companies in the construction sector were invited to participate in a series of workshops to increase knowledge sharing build competences and to create a circular value chain from de molition to construction The workshops were organised by themunicipality and as a result a local green construction network was established covering companies involved in demolition construc tion companies architects and public authorities The role of municipalities in the transition towards a circular economy Bornholm Municipality played a crucial role in this case and was actively involved in all stages of the process The fact that Bornholm is an island in uenced the creation of the green construction network as the group of potential stakeholders in the construction industry to a large extent was limited by the geographical bound aries of the island This also implied that many of the local stake holders knew each other personallyThe demolition case illustrated how the municipality could use different modes of governance to in uence the transition from a linear to a circular economy In practice the municipality combined all four main governance modes selfgovernance using the de molition fund to support selective demolition governing by pro vision using the ownership to the local waste company BOFA as a storage facility for the demolished construction materials gov erning by authority using waste planning and the waste man agement authority during demolition procedures and governing through enabling creating networks and partnerships between local stakeholders in the construction and demolition sector Throughout the entire project the most important role of the municipality was that of an enabler and change agent who could contact stakeholders and facilitate increased communication be tween stakeholders Discussion the role of cities and local governments in the transformation towards a circular economy Recent research has indicated that cities and local governments can play an important role in the creation of closedloop production and consumption systems Bolger and Doyon PetitBoix and Leipold In political science the traditional statecentred research which typically sees the national state as a single sover eign authority has been contested by researchers arguing that a broader perspective on governance is needed to fully understand the complex functioning of the public sector and to understand the interaction between public authorities and stakeholders in the private sector Ehnert et al This movement has led to a change in perspective from government togovernance and as part of this process highlighted the role of cities and local govern ments The exact role of local governments may differ from country to country due to the varying relationships between central gov ernments and local governments resulting in different degrees of nancial interdependence different administrative structures etc Bulkeley and Kern Ehnert et al Despite these na tional differences there is a clear trend that cities and local gov ernments are increasingly de ning policies taking action creating demonstration projects and collaborating in partnerships with private companies citizens and knowledge institutions to facilitate and support the transition towards a circular economy Bernhardt et al PetitBoix and Leipold The socalled gover nance perspective not only pays increasing attention to the role of local governments but also emphasises the changing understand ing of the role of local governments from traditional command andcontrol regulation to nonhierarchical modes of coordination and decisionmaking Zvolska et al Table Results from the rst demolition expected resources versus achieved Part Material Expected

indicate that the potential for closing the loops of speci c urban material ows through planning tar geted activities initiated by local governments and implemented in collaboration with local stakeholders The textile project case study indicated that a focussed strategy aimed at increasing the domestic recycling of natural and synthetic bres using a mix of chemical and mechanical treatment processes could contribute signi cantly to a continued and increased recycling of textile bres The imple mentation of such a strategy would increase recycling rates and ensure that exported textiles that today have an unknown and uncertain fate could be handled domestically where recycling rates could be monitored and documented This led to developing our ambitious scenario C which could additionally support the implementation of the EU Waste Framework Directive which speci cally addresses the recycling of textile waste However the developed scenarios also highlighted the need for clarifying the roles and responsibilities of all parties especially with regard to the question of ef ciency in having two parallel collection systems one operated by the publicly owned waste companies focussed onrecycling and one operated by NGOs focussed on the export of reusable textiles to thirdworld countries Further research is needed in this area The demolition case study indicated the potential for an increased recycling of construction and demolition waste The demonstration case illustrated that applying new procedures for environmental screening resource mapping and selective demoli tion could increase the value of the produced demolition materials and generate demolition waste that potentially can be sent back in the chain to be used in the construction of new buildings at a higher level in the waste hierarchy The demonstration project indicated that demolition materials that would otherwise have been crushed and used as lling materials can be recycled provided that the procedures for resource mapping and selective demolition are followed and that the stakeholders involved possess the relevant knowledge competencies and expertise to carry out such proced ures and are able to accurately assess the value of the demolished construction materials A lesson learned from the project is that increasing the knowledge capacity of local demolition companies is important to ensure selective demolition and reuse can be identi ed Traditional demolition practices follow a simple model and the people involved typically only possess limited knowledge about the value of the construction materials and therefore have limited ca pabilities to conduct a reliable assessment of the potential value of the construction materials The role of local governments in a circular economy The two case studies also illustrate multiple ways in which cities and local governments can act as change agents on their own as well as through interaction with external stakeholders in order to support the transition to a circular economy thereby adding to the existing research on the role of local governments in the transitiontowards a circular economy Bolger and Doyon Gravagnuolo et al Whereas existing research on the role of local gov ernment in the circular economy point towards the role of strategic urban planning Bolger and Doyon the analysis in this article suggests that municipalities can use several different modes of governance to act as change agents The analysis illustrates that the involved municipalities during the case studies switched back and forth between four main modes of governance as described in Table below depending on the situation and context While Obersteg et al analysed CE initiatives in six European urban areas and found a general lack of public sector support for privateinitiatives the conclusions form this article point in the opposite direction and seem more in line with studies from Swedish and Dutch cities Bolger and Doyon Prendeville et al Local governments are in many countries heavily involved in planning and regulatory activities that overlap and affect the cir cular economy Most importantly local governments in many countries are responsible or partly responsible for handling waste In Denmark as in most of the neighbouring Scandinavian countries this responsibility includes the development and implementation of policies strategies and plans for the recycling recovery and land lling of material ows This gives the local governments a natural stake in as well as potential in uence on closing the loop of urban material ows Table illustrates how the municipalities in the two case studies used a combination of multiple modes of governance to increase the recirculation of textile waste and CDW The two cases demon strate the potential for closing urban material loops thus contrib uting to the development of the circular economy through governance through enabling especi cally in a partnership be tween local governments businesses and knowledge institutions Such partnerships can be organised in multiple ways The resultsfrom the project suggest that local governments can act as an important anchor for such initiatives using diverse modes of governance Choosing the right mode or modes of governance is partly a choice made locally and partly a choice set by national legislation Governing by authority is primarily decided by the national level of governance whereas the three other modes of governance to a much larger extent depend on the design of the local level policy goals resource allocation and ambitions Limitations and generalisation The implementation of circular economy policies varies signif icantly across the globe McDowall et al compared CE pol icies between Europe and China and found the Chinese CE policies primarily relied on a broad top edownbased approach whereas European policies tended to be based on a bottom eup approach with a more narrow scope focussing on environmental issues but with an emphasis on waste and recycling The analysis in this article supports this conclusion When speci cally addressing local gov ernments the differences between regions in the world and countries become even larger as the level of autonomy at the local level of government varies signi cantly between different coun tries A low degree of autonomy at the local level of government will limit the possibilities of local governments to in uence the transition towards a circular economy Issues such as local capa bilities knowledge power and political will additionally in uence local governments possibilities for acting as a change agent Bulkeley and Betsill The distribution of responsibility between different layers of government is in Denmark to a large extent like in other Scandi navian countries where planning responsibilities and local au tonomy are distributed to local governments municipalities In other European countries especially in the southern and easternparts of Europe less local autonomy exists and the ndings of the case studies cannot be transferred directly However evidence from several studies indicates that local governments in different legal settings have a signi cant role to play despite national differences in terms of the magnitude of local autonomy from the national state The ndings from this study for example correspond with Cramer who analysed the implementation of circular economy programmes in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area and found that collaboration between multiple partners was a key driving force for change despite the fact that the national state typically plays a more signi cant role in the Netherlands than inTB Christensen Journal of Cleaner Production Denmark In Denmark the municipal ownership over utilities in the solid waste wastewater and energy sectors is an important asset for creating change Studies in industrial symbiosis Branson Jacobsen and the energy sector Dams et al illustrate how governing by provision can function as a vehicle for change The same was found in this study where the municipal ownership of local waste companies in uenced collaboration especially in the construction case whereby construction materialswere stored at a facility owned by the waste company BOFA Countries where this type of ownership relations does not exist may evidently not have such possibilities for governing by provision Conclusion The paper analysed how cities and local governments can contribute to developing a circular economy The paper used a framework originally developed by Kern and Bulkeley for studies on climate change mitigation initiatives and utilised this framework to understand circular economy initiatives The paper analysed two case studies focussing on the recirculation of con struction and demolition materials and waste textiles and for both ows found that changed practices can redirect the material ows and support the transformation towards a circular economy In both cases the municipalities collaborated in partnerships with waste companies and knowledge institutions to identify waste streams and to explore pathways for closing material loops Gov erning by provision where the municipalities collaborated with the municipally owned waste company was in both cases found to function as an important driver for change The cases indicated that municipalities can play a vital role in organising capacities among local stakeholders and that municipalities can function as an important change agent to support and facilitate the trans formation towards a circular economy Funding The research was funded by the Capital Region of Denmark the Regional Council Development Funds Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have
