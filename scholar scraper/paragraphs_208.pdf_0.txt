materials for a longer time in a closed loop manner thereby decoupling natural resource usage from economic growth food waste reduction is one of the top priorities under the recent european union s ce package it also contributes to achieving the united nations sustainable development goals sdg while food loss and waste flw prevention and man agement are wellstudied in the literature research in ce is more recent through a systematic literature review this study creates a taxonomy that synthesises the key aspects of flw under the ce papers were reviewed and analysed using keyword cooccurrence analysis kcn and structural dimension analysis in kcn three research themes emerge impact assessment biorefinery and nutrient recycling structural dimension analysis reveals the types of research methods types of flw flows flw prevention and management options with associated opportunities and challenges and the sustainability impact assessment sia addressed in the liter ature a taxonomy is presented and future research directions are highlighted under six research streams i flw supply and quantification ii practices and technological aspects iii logistics and supply chain management iv market demand v sia and vi policy and legislation combining insights from ce and flw prevention and management the taxonomy helps key stakeholders including industry practitioners to grasp new business op portunities politicians to set up support strategies and strategic development plans society to recognise the benefits of wasteoriented bioeconomy and consumers to raise their awareness and be actively involved in ce introduction a third of the annual food produced for human consumption roughly billion tons is either wasted or lost along the food supply chain fsc fao food loss and waste flw accounts for of freshwater use of total global cropland area of global fertiliser use kummu et al and about gtonnes of co equivalent of total greenhouse gas ghg emissions fao halving the amount of flw could contribute to reducing ghg emission from food production by bajzelj et al while about of the world population nearly million is undernourished fao et al and by billion people will need to be adequately fed united nations wasting foods represents a contemporary economic environmental social and ethical challenge on a global scale which requires urgent political attention fao teigiserova et al one of the novel efforts in preventing and managing flw is the adoption of the circular economy ce concept that has been supported in the eu political agenda european commission flw prevention is identified as the top priority and an integral part of an eu action plan for its transition towards the ce the ce action plan not only puts forward a series of actions to promote more sus tainable production and consumption behaviours and patterns in eu food system eg food donation and labelling awareness but also fosters the adoption of biotechnologies and practices to convert flw into a variety of valuable biobased products for longterm socioeconomic and environmental benefits maina et al zabaniotou and kamaterou in the action plan a common eu methodology for flw quanti fication is also proposed to ensure the consistent quantification moni toring and analysis of flw statistics these measures support the eu on its trajectory towards meeting the united nations
