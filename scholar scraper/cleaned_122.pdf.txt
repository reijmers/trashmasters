AustraliaFor my mother Hilda Jones Amor gignit amoremviiAn appreciation of the potential value of waste was perhaps sparked in my childhood As a young boy I would take a monthly drive with my father after working in the garden and cleaning out the garage to the local tip landfill I could not help but notice that the man who operated the tip drove a new shiny red Porsche sports car which he proudly parked at the entry As a tenyearold I thought it incongruous that the man at the tip could afford to buy one of the most expensive cars in the world There must be money in all that rubbish we are throwing away my father would often muse as we drove in In things have changed now my waste is collected each week by a very large truck that belongs to a multinational firm under contract to the local municipal government The local tip is like a fortress with high fences restricted access no go areas and staff in highvisibility clothing The man at the tip has been replaced by investors on the share market The new mantra for waste is that it is a resource that needs to be maximised rather than dumped Waste is something we all generate modern life seems to be impossible without it What happens to our waste is increasingly integral to the future of life on the planet The idea for this book comes from time spent in the Belgian city of Leuven In and I spent time at the KU Leuven as a research fellow It was the lived experience of the city and its waste management system that was life changing in many respects My partner and I were fortunate to stay at university accommodation the Groot Begijnhof in the historic quarter Leuven is part of the Flanders region and the house hold sorting of waste is a legislated requirementthere are financial pen alties for noncompliance Part of our daily routine was to sort our waste Prefaceviii PREFACE into different coloured bagsone for food one for plastics one for gen eral waste and separate paper and cardboard At first this separation rou tine was a shock as we were accustomed to kerbside mixed waste collection and centralised sorting facilities in our hometown of Brisbane in Australia After a short period we came to prefer the Flanders model we believed we were taking responsibility and even began determining our purchases that would fit into the separation scheme easily and we even began reduc ing our consumption Each week someone wheeling a handcart would walk the cobbled streets of the Begijnhofno vehicles allowedand remove our waste if it was separated correctly if not it was left behind with a note requesting we correct the problem The fact that this lived experience forced us to think about our waste habits and to change our behaviour sparked my research interest The experience also reinforced the view that government policy has a role to play in bringing about the change needed to establish sustainable approaches that reduce our impact on the planet My sincere thanks go to Professor Brian Head for his encouragement to write this book His valuable feedback on my development of the theo retical framework gave the project added importance His recognition of the significance of waste as a policy problem also buoyed me when I began questioning the value of my contribution Thanks also to Professor Geert Bouckaert who has always supported my research ideas and helped me understand the essence of politics in Belgium In this case he also intro duced me to senior managers in the Belgian recycling industry I also owe gratitude to Associate Professor Jon Hovland Honerud for providing me with important insights into the unique aspects of the Norwegian political system My greatest gratitude and dedication goes to my partner Anna who inspires and supports my ambitions and keeps me focused when doubts seem overwhelming I am always grateful for the support I receive from the Business School at the University of Queensland It is hard to imagine a more supportive environment for

the book It outlines the current situation contributing to an international crisis in waste management It provides some insights into contemporary approaches to waste management policy by governments The interest in advancing a circular economy to provide the possible solutions to waste management practices that contribute the current crisis is also raised The conclusion outlines the basic structure of the book and justifications for the analysis and the approach taken Keywords Waste management crisis Circular economy Sustainability Public policy A W Aste Crisis This book is about an escalating modernday crisis our inability to man age our waste in a sustainable way In the UN Environment Programme made the stirring declaration in the language of social justice that waste management underpins society in the twentyfirst century Appropriate sanitation and solid waste management aligns with potable water shelter food energy transport and communications as essential to society and to the economy as a whole UNEP World Bank data shows billion tonnes of municipal solid waste MSW was generated worldwide in and at least was not managed in an environmen tally safe manner RicciJurgensen et al By the world is expected to increase waste generation by to billion tonnes of waste annually World Bank One impact of this scenario is the proliferation of plastic in the waste stream Current predictions show that even with immediate concerted action plastic waste alone will be enter ing global marine ecosystems at triple current volumes in the next years Lau et al Evidence shows the detrimental effects of plastic pollu tion including ingestion by sea creatures leading to economic costs on fishing tourism and shipping industries Micro plastic waste is now mov ing through the human food system and has become discoverable in human organs Carrington Equally significant is the environmen tal pressure arising from household consumption now recognised as con tributing to more than of global greenhouse gas emissions and between and of total land material and water use Ivanova et al Methods of dealing with our waste are failing to prevent significant environmental damage and we need to give priority to identifying sustainable practices that will help to reduce our impact on ecological systems critical to our longterm survival One of the most significant events to raise attention to the current mal aise occurred in the early months of when the Chinese government as part of its National Sword Policy imposed a ban on the importation of various forms of waste from Europe North America and Asia In European countries alone had exported over two billion metric tonnes of plastic waste to China dAmbrires Most of the waste material shipped was sold in a system of international markets trading in recyclable materials The Chinese government argued that much of the waste they received was contaminated and not suitable for recyclingexporting countries had failed to sort the waste appropriately Smyth Freytas Tamura As a result of the Chinese ban many governments and citizens in developed countries suddenly discovered the results of their efforts to recycle had actually been shipped to developing countries and often dumped in rivers and oceans as a result of poor waste management practices Sparrow Contributing to the Chinese ban was the revelation that waste was being processed in many developed countries such as Canada and the UK by private contractors and they were sending waste offshore without government monitoring or approval Ross Rabson Primarily however waste was exported because it had a higher market value than S M JONES any other method of processing it The ban created a domino effect with other developing countries following Chinas lead by refusing to take waste from developed countries Some like Malaysia shipped the waste back to the source countries for example Spain Reuters These bans exposed many developed countries failure to establish their own recycling capabilities as they preferred to maintain traditional waste management methods of landfill and incineration The US and Australia are typical examples where recycling remains underdeveloped and marginal in the absence of specific regulations Because of the preference for exporting waste from these countries less than of plastic waste is recycled locally dAmbrires Challenges for governments are set to continue as the Chinese government will ban all imports of solid waste from and will no longer accept or approve import applications for solid waste On a global scale countries both developed and developing have committed to achieving the UNDPs Sustainable Development Goals SDGs UNDP The UN SDG is to promote responsible consumption and production It is the idea that production and consumption have created volumes of waste that threaten the existence of humanity that is forcing an examination of alternatives to dump and run approaches Vidal argues that there is no way to make current levels of consumption sustainable Arrangements between government and industry to reduce volumes of waste and to establish materials that can be reused and recycled more easily have failed to achieve the necessary improvements and to achieve the progress required by the SDGs The most recent progress report on the SDGs makes this clear Globally the generation of waste is mounting About one third of the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted most of it in developed countries Urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to overextraction of resources and further degradation of the environment Policies must be embraced to improve resource efficiency reduce waste and mainstream sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy UNDESA The current situation works in favour of vested interests as one observer claims Far from saving the planet waste management is now a billion industry thats become an environmental disaster Financial Times A recent survey of consumers in SouthEast Asia found that INTRODUCTION were concerned about plastic waste but were not changing their purchasing habits Up to of businesses have set voluntary targets to address plastic waste but less than onethird actually communicate that target Less than half are part of industrywide voluntary collaborations to tackle plastic waste There is an expectation by both business and consumers that governments should take stronger action including mandating waste segregation enhancing collection systems and imposing fines on littering UNEP The waste crisis has created a sense of urgency towards identifying actions that governments can take to establish more sustainable approaches to manage waste EMAF Muranko et al One solution promoted by many governments is a paradigm shift from the established linear economy based on take make and dispose principles towards sustainable approaches developed in a circular economy The idea of circular economy is of great interest to both researchers and practitioners as it is seen to reinvigorate interest in the concept of sustainability Proposals for circular approaches require a distinct shift away from long term linear practices that include one of capitalisms driving principles planned obsolescence A circular approach is promoted as one where products can be designed better to last longer food chains and toymakers dont have to make poorquality goods producers can use fewer virgin raw materials waste can be made a resource With such changes it is argued a circular economy can begin to be developed To achieve these outcomes government policies can help make corporations more responsible in terms of their impact on natural resources and the environment generally AdvAnCing A CirCulAr eConomy Governments tend to promote the circular economy as a blueprint for reform of waste management that encourages the Rs approach of reduce reuse and recycle in the waste hierarchy thus complying with public interest in sustainability this is where significant challenges exist Corporations and governments that are in the business of growth do not necessarily want to address sustainability issues created by consumption But they do want to focus on aspects of waste that may create economic opportunities In this paradigm waste is increasingly framed by governments as a resource to be exploited With a growing business interest in the resource argument government waste policy can focus on S M JONES a number of contemporary problems simultaneously the increasing scarcity and prices of raw materials particularly precious metals and a consequential decrease in industrial productivity along with an ever growing volume of waste ibid The valorisation of waste as a resource has for many scholars become an integral element of the interest of business in waste management and the promotion of circularity Savini In the UN advocated taking a holistic approach towards waste management and recognising waste and resource management as a significant contributor to sustainable development and climate change mitigation The UN recognised a need for addressing governance issues which help to establish sustainable solutionsincluding the regulatory and other policy instruments the partnerships and the financing models UNEP Existing voluntary approaches suffer in many instances from poorly specified objectives and inadequate performance data In the absence of explicitly articulated regulatory or marketbased measures voluntary initiatives have been less ambitious and less economically efficient than the more conventional policy alternatives European experience indicates that voluntary policies can work quite effectively if complemented by public policy instruments like regulations taxes or tradable permits Paton The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and the European Union EU have been advocates of the transition to circular approaches to establish sustainable economic development In considering the opportunities and challenges of a circular economy from a policy perspective the OECD observes Circular business models use already existing materials and products as inputs and therefore their environmental footprint tends to be considerably smaller than that for traditional business models OECD EU surveys of circular strategies at each level of government claims that waste processing is an almost essential element in any circular economy strategy EESC Further to this the EU suggests that waste processing and particularly municipal waste management are common issues affecting whole national territories opportunities to improve it largely depend on legislative issues at national or European level ibid A move to a more sustainable society requires greater sophistication to manage waste Seadon A lot of time and money needs to be spent by government and industry educating residents on the value of sorting waste in the household RR OVAM Of course residents INTRODUCTION need to be on side and be willing to participate Challenges need to be faced by individual consumers as the generators of waste They must assume a high degree of responsibility for placing contaminants into the recycling system that the waste management system must deal with Thornton If residents have been accustomed to the ease of centralised sorting a move to more complexity and effort becomes challenging Petts argues that the most effective management of waste has to relate to the local environmental economic and social priorities Surveys suggest that there is a willingness within communities to take more responsibility for waste in Europe this is particularly strong Surveys by the European Commission show that waste is of concern to Europeans with of those surveyed wanting their country to waste less EU Reporter When the survey research was released the EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potoc nik claimed Waste clearly touches a nerve Europeans want to waste less and they are making efforts to practise what they preach This makes moving to a more circular economy a logical step forward The appetite for more recycling is there now we need to deliver the mechanisms to help it happen ibid The crisis in the recycling industry has created a degree of disquiet in many countries where citizens had a level of trust in governments and their waste management systems When asked about ways to encourage more recycling of respondents to a European Commission survey on the issue say reassurance that their waste is effectively recycled would persuade them to separate more of their waste A majority favours more and better waste recycling and composting facilities in their area EC Research evidence by Nilsson and Harring supports this information They found that institutional trust levels of individuals and trustworthiness of the thirdparty enforcer in the dilemma context should be considered important factors for recycling behaviour The threat to this trust in institutions created by the current crisis could be an opportunity to promote change The policy change literature maintains that a crisis can become the catalyst for governments to focus on alternative approaches to policy problems Kingdon and Stano Birkland Boin et al Cairney and Jones The literature also makes it clear that policy change requires political priority Arts et al Shiffman and Smith Baker et al Jones Governments need to commit resources and implement regulatory S M JONES measures The examination of policy change in waste management particularly in multilevel systems involves understanding the political and institutional context the role of key actors in the policy process the role of ideas in shaping public acceptance for change and influence of the characteristics of waste as a policy issue Recent academic assessments of circular economy initiatives suggest the vast majority focus on recycling activities without major commitments to the other Rs in the waste hierarchyreduce and reuse Van den Berghe et al Such observations raise questions about genuine commitments to a circular economy beyond business opportunity and politically charged debates that focus on economic prosperity Analysis that takes a sociological and philosophical perspective argues that the circular economy provides a powerful narrative that supports a transition to more sustainable production and consumption systems De Angelis and Ianulardo Kirchherr et al argue that despite its attractiveness the circular economy has largely remained elusive in terms of precise meaning This lack of precision means the idea is contested and can be captured by policy and business advocacy groups Korhonen et al There have been some attempts by researchers to provide directions for policymakers to understand the consequences as well as the support needed to promote circular approaches Bauwens et al Survey research of firms reveals a delicate balance where government regulations standards and procedure can be either a significant barrier or a facilitator in implementing circular activities GarcsAyerbe et al Welldesigned and implemented public policy can potentially change both business practice and citizen behaviour towards environmental out comes Santor et al Ding et al Current approaches need to be reconsidered if governments are to support establishing more sus tainable development Policies and legislative instruments across the EU established to promote sustainability focus primarily on potential eco nomic benefits social benefits tend to be overlooked Of the policies examined in discuss the impact on air soil and water pollution on waste reduction and on greenhouse gas emissions UNDESA A possible reason for these inconsistencies is that both governments and business tend to favour voluntary measures above those that are regu lated and compulsory Anton et al A common view is that busi ness is willing to support environmental outcomes if they do not impact on profit Banerjee Evidence suggests that voluntary approaches have so far proven to be largely ineffective and regulatory action will be INTRODUCTION required in resolving environmental challenges posed by current waste management practices Borck and Coglianese This is particularly true for nonbinding voluntary agreements that are common in dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and waste management Glachant Transition to a circular economy will require a regulatory contribution by governments It seems clear that business as usual for managing waste is no longer possible A shift to circular approaches will require policy priority that is reflected in regulatory measures that help support business transi tion away from the linear model of production consumption and disposal Book stru Cture The objective of this book is to outline a multitheoretical framework designed to help understand the complexities and challenges associated with establishing priority for policy change towards waste management and advancing a circular economy The approach taken in each chapter is as follows Chapter will outline a more indepth analysis of the nature of waste management and the prevailing crisis In Chap the circular economy is discussed in terms of its requirements and the challenges of implementation Chapter deals with the nature of political priority as one of the important contributions of this research If we are to move towards a circular economy then we need to understand the challenges in bringing about policy change If we accept the central role of govern ments to bring about policy change then we need to understand oppor tunities and limitations to reform the current waste management processes to those of a circular economy Another key consideration of this research is the challenges present in multilevel systems where responsibility for waste management policy and implementation can be shared between different levels of government and their impact on prioritising policy change Chapters and will present case study evidence to highlight the importance of political priority in the context of multilevel systems First is the approach taken in Belgium and particularly in Flanders the largest and most populous region Belgium adopted a national circular strategy in June earlier than many of the other EU countries followed by the Belgian regions of Brussels and Flanders in EESC This will show the extent of the political commitment and actions taken by Belgium in achieving some of the highest rates of recycling of municipal waste in the world The Belgian example is not perfect but it is illustra tive of the extent to which governments in multilevel systems need to S M JONES maintain policy priority in order to improve waste processing to more sustainable levels The next chapter focuses on Norway as a widely viewed leader in waste management The Norwegian approach to recycling plas tic is heralded as a model for other countries Taylor This case highlights the importance of institutional context and the role of policy actors in shaping government responses in a multilevel system Norway is not a member of the EU but the national government continues to make statements about achieving the standards of waste management agreed to by the European Parliament including adopting circular approaches to waste management Yet despite national political statements supporting the benefits of the circular economy the enthusiasm has not transferred to a policy priority for establishing a national circular strategy The reality reveals Norway as one of the top five generators of hazardous waste in Europe at over kgyearcapita NCM Norwegian house holds also have one of the highest levels of per capita municipal waste generation in Europe ibid Norwegian municipal governments also contract out much of their waste management to the private sector and export much of this waste for incineration It is an important case in this respect as it helps to reveal the challenge of political priority in the con text of intergovernmental relations In the final chapter the political pri ority framework is applied to bring together the issues revealed in the case studies and draws insights for governments

under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG S M Jones Advancing a Circular Economy  Waste Management A Policy Paradox Abstract This chapter pr ovides a more indepth analysis of waste man agement policy The prime focus is on countries in the European Union with some consideration of OECD countries Of particular interest are approaches towards recycling waste with special consideration of plastic waste Plastic is particularly toxic in the environment and has become a ubiquitous problem across the globe The relevance of the challenges of governance and leadership in multilevel systems in policy change are also outlined The need to shift from voluntary to mandatory approaches is also outlined as necessary for policy action to establish more sustainable approaches to waste management Keywords Waste management policy European Union OECD Governance Leadership Voluntary approaches Mandatory regulations Introduct Ion What happens to our waste In most developed countries the answer to this question is largely hidden from view Citizens place a degree of trust in organisations public or private that collect their household waste each week to deal with it in an environmentally responsible manner Jones et al OECD b Nilsson and Harring The idea that waste could end up floating in an ocean to be eaten by an Albatross seems surreal Worse still the idea of waste contributing to the eventual extinction of sea life would give most of us heartbreak Eriksen et al Yet the evidence seems to be that something is terribly wrong with the waste management systems in developed countries Giusti By contributing to significant environmental damage waste management policies in developed countries exhibit the classic conditions of a policy paradox Stone Since the early s as a consequence of environment management policies large volumes of waste from developed countries have been sent to developing countries that end up contributing to extreme forms of environmental dam age Howard There have been reports of tyres exported from the UK being burned in Indian waste dumps electronic waste from Australia being burned at the Agbogbloshie dump in Africa and traces of plastic waste being dumped in the Mariana Trench metres below sea level Monbiot Le Tourneau Cookson and Hook Evidence like this has strengthened arguments that waste management in developed countries has been a longterm campaign of toxic colonialism at the expense of developing countries and the environment Clapp In May Malaysias minister for energy technology science envi ronment and climate change Ms Yeo Bee Yin appeared before a gather ing of international media at Port Klang With shipping containers loaded with waste as her backdrop she claimed These containers were illegally brought into the country under false declaration and other offences which clearly violates our environmental law SMH Malaysian officials identified at least origin countries including the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD members like the US Japan France Canada Australia and Britain The minister stated I am calling out to these countries and other countries too we have a problem We have to solve our own waste problems in our own backyard Its a message we wish to convey internationally ibid Countries such as Thailand Indonesia Vietnam and India were making similar discoveries and passing restrictions prohibiting the importation of waste being shipped to their countries from developed countries For example Vietnam announced that it would ban the import of scrap mate rial in early in response to concerns by residents about worsening environmental conditions and the health of locals Nguyen and Roth Most significant of all was the restrictions and stringent bans placed by China in March As the worlds largest importer of lowquality kerbside recycling materials Chinas National Sword policy of import restrictions on contaminated waste had repercussions across Europe S M JONES North America and Asia In echoing the sentiments of these countries Yeo Bee Yin stated we will do our very best to ensure that Malaysia not be the plastic rubbish bin of developed countries SMH The export of waste from developed to developing countries has been controversial for more than years The United Nations Development Programme UNDP argued in that it perpetuates inequality and supports the movement of waste across borders According to Beylot et al the consumption and production of products goods and ser vices are responsible for adverse effects to the environment encompass ing effects on human health and natural resources Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns is goal of the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs UNDP and it has been considered an overarching objective and an essential requirement for sustainable devel opment UN In the European Union EU Sustainable Consumption and Production SCP is targeted through a number of policy instruments as adopted under the Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan European Commission and the Circular Economy Action Plan European Commission These are intended to improve the overall environmental performance of products through out their life cycle stimulate demand for better products and production technologies and help consumers make informed choices European Parliament Moreover in the Seventh Environmental Action Program EAP EU the EU has a longterm objective of living well within the planets ecological limits implying a significant decoupling of environmental impact from economic growth and welfare As a result of the current action by developing countries to reject waste circumstances have taken on added urgency and the UNDP proposed revising the Basel Convention giving the receiving country the right to refuse polluted or mixed plastic waste that it could not manage safely In a partial response in July countries agreed to amend the Basel Convention to make global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated The actions of governments in China Malaysia Vietnam Thailand India and Indonesia to stop the importation and processing of contami nated waste have caused many OECD countries to reconsider their approaches to waste management These developments are part of a trend of questioning the volumes of waste being produced the nature of the waste for example plastics and ewaste and the volumes of waste being recycled andor placed in landfill Hoornweg et al Contemporary methods have relied on exporting waste as a means of managing W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX expanding volumes of municipal waste and meeting international obliga tions to recycle waste The countries having waste returned from Malaysia have been forced to deal with the need to establish new approaches to waste management that could have longterm economic and environmen tal consequences Waste as PolIcy Issue The OECD defines municipal waste as the waste collected by or on behalf of municipalities and includes household waste originating from house holds ie waste generated by domestic activity of households and similar waste from small commercial activities office buildings institutions such as schools and government buildings and small businesses that treat or dispose of waste at the same facilities used for municipally collected waste OECD According to OECD data during the s municipal waste increased mostly in line with private consumption expendi ture and GDP Currently the quantity of municipal waste generated exceeds an estimated million tonnes A person living in an OECD country generates on average kg of waste per year see Fig Countries such as Denmark kg the US kg and Australia kg are at the high end of the scale Others such as Japan kg and South Korea kg represent lower levels of consumption The amount and composition of municipal waste vary widely being related to levels and patterns of consumption the rate of urbanisation lifestyles and national and local waste management practices On average Europeans kgcapitaMunicipa l wast e per capita Of which Househol d wast e Estonia Poland

less than people living in North America but kg more than people living in the OECD AsiaOceania region According to OECD research business as usual will increase the envi ronmental impacts that are associated with harvesting resources process ing and using them and disposing of the resulting waste OECD Areas of particular concern from this linear approach include the local environmental damages and greenhouse gas GHG emissions associated with material extraction and processing Nuss and Eckelman IPCC reports show that emissions from the waste sector are among the largest sources of nonCO GHG emissions IPCC Current methods of waste management primarily landfill produce climaterelated CH emis sions The mitigation of these emissions would make an important contri bution to reduce global warming Zickfeld et al Developed countries play an important role in this scenario but significant changes to current waste management policies in many countries will be required Municipal waste has traditionally been viewed as a management issue dealt with by technical experts using different models that apply methods and tools such a risk assessment cost benefit analysis and life cycle analysis as part of the decisionmaking process The goals of these models have varied from the simple optimising the routes of vehicles transporting waste to complex objectives such as life cycle analysis of products Morrissey and Browne In the s models focused on examina tion of a specific problem of waste disposal such as transfer station siting Landfill was the dominant processing option and recycling was rarely taken into account Landfill strategy undertaken by engineers and plan ners was given precedence over the political and social concerns of elected representatives and community organisations often resulting in friction between experts the local community and the local politicians Morrissey and Brown Such approaches were unsuitable for longterm planning Approaches taken in the s extended the focus to examine the relationships between each factor in a waste management system Cost minimisation was a key objective and recycling and behaviour change also entered the approaches encouraged by some researchers Englehardt The minimisation of the waste generated was yet to be seen as a worthy concern in the debates concerned with the waste generated by households This was to change soon as green groups and anticonsumer ist activists began raising the negative environmental consequences of the accumulation of waste Savini W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX During the s waste policy shifted from a reliance on landfill to a more integrated approach that considered a broad range of waste streams and preferred management practices based on sitespecific environmental and economic considerations Whole of life cycle of products was pro moted as part of a full assessment of the systems of environmental impact Morrissey and Browne Facing increasing public demand for more sustainable practices many European countries banned landfill and focused on identifying alternative forms of waste disposal and to moder nise waste management The following three reasons were most often cited for waste being a policy problem waste disposal can harm the envi ronment and human health space for landfills was becoming scarce as community opinion moved against them and waste is the end product of a life cycle process that can have upstream environmental and resource depletion implications There was also the underlying moral view of waste generation arguing that it is symptomatic of wasteful and undesirable overconsumption PC xxvii By the early s researchers argued the focus on economic and envi ronmental aspects of previous decades needed to change if sustainable management practices were to be implemented For a waste management system to be sustainable it should be seen as integral component of social and ecological systems In this regard it needed to be environmentally effective economically affordable and socially acceptable Evidence was emerging that waste management programmes that ignored the social aspects was doomed to failure Joos et al Petts argued that the most effective management of waste needed to relate to local environmental economic and social priorities Waste management programmes and policies began taking social aspects into account and indicators for sustainable waste management were developed Social aspects included the problems of communication public acceptance NIMBYsocial compatibility public participation in planning and implementation consumer behaviour intergenerational factors and changing value systems Morrissey and Browne Largely as a result of these developments contemporary waste manage ment is typically based around the notion of sustainability through the concept of a waste hierarchy This approach sees waste avoidance as prefer able to reuse reuse to recycling Disposal particularly to landfill and incineration are seen to be the least desirable options given the space required pollution generated and the missed opportunities of reusing valuable resources In compliance with this approach many jurisdictions S M JONES have set targets for diverting waste some going so far as to aim for zero waste to landfill Zaman Different OECD countries adopt their preferred methods of waste management with varying degrees of landfill and recycling rates see Fig Waste policy is now likely to support managerial strategies and waste treatment technologies that seek to main tain environmental quality and to meet sustainability goals Policies allow both waste management industries and government agencies to meet common needs of waste management with the greatest environmental potential to recycle materials out of waste streams to enlarge the renew able energy supply to seek for more socially acceptable options and to preserve biodiversity and natural ecosystems simultaneously According to the UN Environment Programme achieving these goals requires all technical and nontechnical aspects of a waste management system to be analyzed as a whole since they are interrelated with one another and developments in one area frequently affect practices or activities in another area Pires et al The crisis in waste management has raised attention to some of the pitfalls of current approaches to waste management Cities in OECD countries are among the largest waste generators producing around million tonnes per day According to the peak waste argument the vol ume of waste is expected to increase in OECD countries until owing to urban population growth Hoornweg et al The magnitude of Landfill Municipal waste household and similar waste collected by or for municipalities orginating

development and individual consumption waste production rates in cities are often far higher than percapita global averages Kennedy et al Increasing population in many countries and accelerated urbanisa tion particularly in lower and lowermiddle income nations are expected to increase global waste production for several decades Hoornweg et al Businessasusual projections show that by solidwaste generation rates will exceed million tonnes per daymore than three times current rates ibid In the total waste generated in the EU by all economic activities and households amounted to mil lion tonnes this was the highest amount recorded for the EU during the period EU Research suggests that in multilevel systems effective management of waste will require cooperative and coor dinated governance arrangements between governments This is particu larly the case in the EU where municipal waste is no longer the province of relatively autonomous municipalities concerned with collection and disposal of waste and is now a complex process in which a range of inter national institutions national regional and local government agencies and nonstate actors have a degree of influence and responsibility Bulkeley et al The management of waste has been at the centre of objectives includ ing protecting human health and the environment economic develop ment and the fulfilment of social and regulatory stipulations Soltani et al The complexity of decisionmaking in this policy area is high lighted by the need to consider multiple and often contradictory criteria eg environmental impacts like global warming human health risks resource depletion and damage to ecosystems economic costs and ben efits contextual issues such as waste type and rate of generation political and social factors and international obligations that establish govern ment commitments to change Giusti Pires et al Soltani et al de Souza Melare et al Other issues include failure to effectively deal with the challenges of data collection and facilitate experi mentation learning and change Morrissey and Brown The current crisis has focused the attention of governments on developing an effective policy response One particular area of concern is the prolifera tion of plastic in the waste stream The next section highlights the chal lenges for policymakers in implementing policies that consider the complexities of both consumption and disposal of material that continues to be the source of a serious environmental problem S M JONES Plast Ic Waste a symbol Ic case Some of the most evocative symbols of the current state of waste manage ment are the floating platforms or plastic gyres in the Indian and Pacific oceans The case of plastic waste encapsulates many of the arguments around policy issues of the current waste management crisis and the pos sible solutions to the associated problems Estimates show that the global production of plastic has increased from million metric tons Mt in to million Mt in see Fig Geyer et al By the end of million Mt of virgin plastic had been produced roughly twothirds of which has been released into the environment and remains there in some formas debris in the oceans as micro or nanoparticles in the air and agricultural soils as microfibers in water supplies or as mic roparticles in the human body Figure shows that by of the approximately Mt of plastic waste generated around had been recycled incinerated and accumulated in landfills or the natural environment Geyer et al A report released by the Centre for Environmental Law CIEL in raised attention to the ongoing hidden environmental costs of plas tic and the failure of current waste management practices to deal with Other Textiles Industrial Machinery Consumer Institutional Products ElectricalElectronic Building Construction Transportation Packaging Primary Plastic Production in Mt Fig Global Plastic Pr oduction Source Geyer R W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX these costs CIEL Key points from the report focus on the produc tion of waste the disposal of waste and the potential solutions to the problems caused by the waste management process OECD reports highlight two key environmental impacts from plastic First tradi tional plastics production is highly energyintensive and was estimated to account for million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions around of the global total in The fossil fuel feedstock used in plastics pro duction also accounts for of global oil and gas production Further carbon dioxide as well as other greenhouse gases are emitted when plastic is incinerated Second the proliferation of plastics use in combination with poor endoflife waste management has resulted in widespread per sistent plastics pollution Modelling suggests that around of global plastics waste generation or Mt was mismanaged in Plastic pollution is present in all the worlds major ocean basins including remote islands the poles and the deep seas and an additional to million tonnes are introduced every year OECD Developed coun tries faced with the problem of too much plastic waste too little capacity to recycle and a lack of demand for recycled plastic have exported the problem to poorer countries as a key strategy to deal with domestic post consumer waste T earfund There is no mechanism for source countries to be held accountable for the impacts of plastic waste exported for recycling to other countries particularly to countries less able to man age waste Searching for possible solutions to the problems created by plastic waste has focused on recycling and disposal elements of waste manage ment processes Recycling has proven to be disappointing as evidenced by the failure in many OECD countries to develop substantial recycling industries In countries such as the UK there have been incentives to export plastic waste rather than develop domestic recycling industries The Australian prime minister described the situation his country We are not recycling plastics in this country its going into landfill or its going into boats and being sent up to Asia and ends up washing out of rivers and creating islands of plastic off the coast of the United States where it drifts to which is three times the size of France Martin Recent reports from the UK National Audit Office highlight the key issues The system provides a financial incentive for reprocessors and exporters to increase packaging recycling rates to meet EU targets and makes obligated companies responsible for contributing to the costs of recycling the packag S M JONES ing they put on the market The regulations do not place a direct require ment on obligated companies to collect and recycle their own packaging Instead they allow for packaging to be collected as part of the normal man agement of waste in the UK both by local authorities and commercial col lectors before being sorted and sold for recycling or disposed of through landfill or incineration The regulations then allow accredited reprocessors and exporters to issue recovery notes for the amount of packaging they have recycled and to sell these notes to obligated companies NAO Some European countries are leading the way in many respects with some having developed a model that attempts to manage plastic waste and reduce marine pollution There is increasing recognition that recycling alone will not solve the plastic waste problem Arguments for greater stew ardship stress that companies need to take responsibility for the plastics they produce by making them recyclable and by reducing the volumes of production Programmes are based on the principle of extended producer responsibility EPR first outlined in Sweden in Lindhqvist The central idea is that EPR strengthens stewardship by shifting financial responsibility for endoflife disposal to product manufacturers providing an incentive for improved product design reuse and recycling Tibbetts In these schemes producers pay the costs of tracking managing and recycling or disposing of packaging after their products have been used Examples such as the UK case suggest that waste management pol icy must also support a stronger stimulation of public responsibility towards plastic consumption McNicholas and Cotton Legislation requires manufacturers to recover their packaging after product consump tion Scholars liken the situation to addressing air pollution where people have long realised that filtering the air is not a longterm solution Filtering the oceans seems similarly implausible Cressey Eriksen et al argue for comprehensive approaches that involves going to the source by reducing the use of plastic improving waste management and recycling the materials to stop them from reaching the environment In G governments met in Tokyo and agreed to a set of volun tary actions to promote a comprehensive life cycle approach to urgently and effectively prevent and reduce plastic litter discharge to the oceans Using measures including environmentally sound waste management environmentally sound cleanup of marine plastic litter deployment of innovative solutions and international cooperation to enhance national capacities as well as prevention and reduction of plastic waste generation W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX and littering promotion of

seabased sources G The world is yet to see whether international voluntary agreements such as this by the G can be effective in making a serious impact on the volumes of plastic waste currently impacting on the environment Governance and leadersh IP Within the multilevel context municipal governments are playing an increasingly important role in policy innovation towards improving sus tainability Satterthwaite argues that many of the processes implicit in urbanisation can have a positive overall effect as urban residents can generate a substantially smaller volume of GHG emissions than residents elsewhere in the same country Wellplanned and governed cities provide the potential for delinking high quality of life from high levels of con sumption which is the critical factor leading to reducing the environmen tal impact of waste Satterthwaite The argument includes the potential of city governments to establish sustainable waste management processes that apply the principles of the waste management hierarchy reduce reuse recycle through education programmes to reduce waste establishing recycling industries and avoiding landfill Addressing urban waste involves complex arrangements involving citizens and industry par ticipation and consists of technologies regulations public services and user practices Bugge et al argue that the process represents dealing with pathdependent interwoven and institutionalised sociotechnical regimes that can be hard to change A transition to more sustainable waste management practices will require a fundamental shift of social and insti tutional components and the redesign of the physical infrastructure sys tem Consideration must be given to urban governance arrangements as they impact on the capacity for policy change and innovation Hartley argues that we should consider innovations particularly radical or complex ones to be multidimensional She described three competing paradigms of governance and public management traditional public administration and New Public Management NPM and networked governance which may be conducive to particular ways in which innova tion is both generated and adopted Bugge et al argue that S M JONES different governance regimes affect innovation dynamics in urban waste systems in different and challenging ways For them the traditional model constitutes an organisation where the municipality controls and carries out most of the wasterelated activities inhouse NPM implies a system of gov ernance where the municipality outsources several wasterelated activities to private companies by issuing highly specified public tenders A net worked model of governance implies an organisation where the munici pality facilitates and orchestrates interaction and synergies across the actors involved in the collection and processing of organic waste from both the public and the private sector Each of these models has strengths and weaknesses and may coexist in bringing about change In terms of waste management however the limitation of governance is that its focus tends to be on system optimisation rather than system change Bugge et al There is not one best governance regime but a need to acknowl edge their co existence and car efully consider the characteristics implica tions of the different regimes in order to arrange for longterm dynamic and sustainable cities and regions Like other wicked policy problems in multilevel systems waste requires joint action between governments and relevant stakeholders including civil society epistemic communities and business groups Head Improvements to waste management cannot rely on local governments alone Clearly local authorities are principal players but their limited resources flexibility and authority undermine their capacity to enable sus tainable waste management Entwistle Approaches that require stewardship responsibilities by producers will need policy support from other levels of government that hold the appropriate policy levers The development of consistent approaches across jurisdictions will also require national policies to establish minimum standards indicating that multilevel government is a key mode in the governing of municipal waste Bulkeley et al Business also has a role to play in terms of participa tion and commitment to sustainable approaches that reflect government policy commitments Waste policy action towards sustainability requires political leaders mobil ising official institutions and wider political systems into providing resources and enacting regulatory interventions commensurate with social economic and environmental challenges Borraz and John argue that leadership is crucial to the functioning and success of local governance The politics

Australia Working with Stakeholders in Victoria in Infrastructure Victorias IV Elissa McNamara explains how Victoria could recover up to per cent of its waste if billion is spent on recycling infrastructure in the next two decades National Goals for consistency National packaging targets can be met if Victoria can transform its resource and recycling sector It is very important to be consistent and focus on both state and national approaches Investment in improved data will also be needed Every Australian state and territory will have its own challenges across the next decade but McNamara says interstate colleagues are willing to share learnings and contribute to the national waste action policy She notes that there is national focus on boosting landfill levy consistency and examining how consistent approaches could be economically viable for infrastructure investments McNamara says collaboration is essential to providing a consistent service across Victoria Stakeholder interest In May IV released its report which recommended upgrading or building new processing facilities for six priority materials plastics paper and cardboard glass organics tyres and ewaste to achieve a per cent recovery target over the next two decades Weve certainly had no shortage of interest from local governments industry stakeholders and the private sector who are responsible for building a stronger and more sustainable recycling and resource recovery industry for Victoria McNamara says More than stakeholders have attended various briefings and webinars held by IV in the past three months to discuss its infrastructure advice Importantly McNamara says there has also been strong interest from investment funds and market analysts looking to identify development opportunities in the sector Industry Collaboration with concerns According to Rose Read National Waste and Recycling Industry Council NWRIC CEO IVs report and advice is comprehensive but it comes very much from an infrastructure lens Simply building better collection systems to clean up inputs and more processing infrastructure will not increase recovery rates You also need to build markets at the same time to match demand with supply she says While NWRIC supports all of IVs recommendations Read says focus must be placed on strengthening markets for priority materials cleaner inputs greater recovery of energy from non recyclable waste and better planning by strengthening the status of and processes around Victorias Recycling Infrastructure Plan This will fix many of the major systemic problems Victoria currently has but to really drive and create a circular economy it must look at waste as more than an essential service but also as an important resource industry Read says McNamara stresses the opportunity for the private and public sector to collaborate in ways they havent before to develop cost effective infrastructure and facilitate a stronger waste and recovery market in Victoria Our work shows there is not one single approach to achieve these outcomes all levels of government business and households will need to work together if we are to realise the huge opportunity before us IV stated in the report Adapted from Coles S M JONES intervention need powerful but creative leadership figures to give a direc tion to local policymaking A political priority for change needs to be established to move away from current approaches and to help ensure more sustainable approaches Examining how governments place political priority on establishing sustainable waste management systems will be important for this transition Effective equitable and sustainable responses will require a strong role for government Keskitalo et al Recognising the complex multidimensional nature of waste as a policy issue that an empowered coordinating policy approaches in multilevel sys tems is more likely to ensure stronger direction and reflexivity towards system change shIftInG from voluntary to mandatory aPProaches Since the s voluntary initiatives have been an important element in the mix of public policies and corporate strategies for managing industrial impacts on the environment Paton Since Keohler revealed that voluntary environmental programmes did not generate significant pollution abatement there has been further research supporting the defi ciencies of voluntary approaches to environmentrelated policies Borck and Coglianese argued that if environmental problems are truly externalities it is not obvious that the average environmental benefits per participant from a voluntary programme will be as high as the average environmental benefits per regulated entity from mandatory regulations Nevertheless the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties probably can motivate action in a way that a certificate of recognition from a volun tary arrangement cannot Morgenstern and Pizer found it hard to argue for voluntary programmes where there is a clear desire for major changes in behaviour The OECD argues that the performance of many voluntary approaches would be improved if there were a real threat of other instruments being used if appropriately set targets are not met OECD For policymakers there is an ongoing question of a bal ance between voluntary and regulatory requirements to produce environ mental outcomes Gunningham and Holley Recent evidence is more conclusive as Coglianese and Nash argued that although governments and policy advocates sometimes urge voluntary programmes as a substitute for conventional government regulation it appears that the W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX most effective voluntary programmes depend on a robust backdrop of community pressure and regulatory threats In attempts to promote change many governments in OECD coun tries have chosen voluntary approaches that focus on providing informa tion subsidies and incentives to respond to complex environmental issues including waste policy Segerson This may be a contribut ing factor to the considerable differences in performance between coun tries in the effectiveness of their policies to promote recycling the volumes of waste going to landfill and the use of incinerators OECD This has particularly been the case in many countries in the European Union where waste prevention plans have been the preferred method of complying with the EU waste directive Countries adopting strong regulations as their approach to improve the effective ness of waste management including prevention perform better than countries that choose largely voluntary campaigns CastilloGimenez et al Johansson and Corvellec Governments that have the highest rates of effective recycling tend to take stronger action through the application of institutional and regulatory measures such as the appli cation of taxes and levies to waste disposal the banning of landfill and the introduction of legislated stewardship obligations for packaging manu facturers OECD a Research highlights the ineffectiveness of many voluntary measures in environment policy due to weak program design and poor fit with the institutional context Prakash and Potoski Similarly a reli ance on marketbased approaches has contributed to a crisis of recycling in many OECD countries following introduction in of the China Sword Policy For countries such as the UK the US Australia and Canada the failure of their recycling programmes required a nationwide reckon ing of current approaches Corkey Jarvis and Robinson Evidence suggests that jurisdictions with ineffective voluntary measures that recognise the need to take stronger policy action shift to law and regulation to reinforce measures such as product life cycle stewardship processing charges and fines as well as other complementary measures Global PSC Voluntary measures tend to work more effectively when backed by strong regulatory and enforcement infrastructure con sisting of legal requirements such as authorisationslicensespermits or standards OECD a Deciding to undertake stronger measures requires policymakers to establish political priority for policy change away from incremental proposals to more radical measures that help to S M JONES transform current unsustainable practices For this to occur however there needs to be a commitment to change as regulation is regarded as a challenging undertaking most governments prefer to avoid Riding et al Weak legislative threats primarily result from the political difficulty of establishing stringent mandatory regulations Governments implement voluntary measures due to the fear of weak mandatory regulations even though participation rates were low In addition to political difficulty it is possible that governments prefer a voluntary approach with a high abate ment rate and low participation rate to one with a low abatement rate and high participation rate because the former generates greater social welfare than the latter Miyamoto In other words getting voluntary agree ment from a small number of large manufacturers may be more manage able than to attempt to promote comprehensive change Because participation is not mandatory there is a tradeoff between the participa tion rate and the abatement rates of individual participating firms The weak legislative threat particularly results from a legislative mandatory standard in which powerful selfinterest groups use political pressure to maintain their positions In addition to the introduction of stronger regulations the OECD argues that whole of government approaches should also be regu lated if effectiveness is to be achieved In recent decades policy coordina tion to support greater policy coherence in multilevel systems has become particularly relevant in many OECD and nonOECD countries mainly due to the emergence of crosscutting multidimensional policy challenges and the subsequent atomisation of administrative structures It is critical for policy effectiveness to regulate for coherence and improve policy coor dination in the way governments work across ministries agencies and other administrative units Governments need to strengthen the institu tional and financial capacities of their centres of government For the coordination of waste policy both vertical and horizontal within and between jurisdictions in multilevel systems needs to be a political priority The policy change literature on environmental policy shows how govern ments have been reluctant to act particularly in the integration of new policy initiatives across jurisdictions Ross and Dovers In many jurisdictions environment policy resides primarily with the subnational and municipal governments According to Dovers environmental issues are often handled as a matter of convenience and tractability Some OECD member countries such as Sweden and the UK have strong W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX traditions and structures of integrated environment policymaking Jordan and Lenschow The UKs coordination system see Russel and Jordan commits all the constituent parts of the national govern ment to meet commonly agreed objectives In Sweden sector responsibil ity has been the central policy principle that coupled with a public management style that prefers clearly specified objectives at the national and partly the sectoral level facilitates integration Jordan and Lenschow Neoliberal approaches that stress strong linkages between government and industry have helped to ensure that powerful industry representatives are placed in positions that directly and indirectly influence the policy decisions that will impact on environmental requirements New gover nance arrangements have attempted to establish greater flexibility towards regulation with more innovative forms of control on the principles of responsive regulation that assume that most enterprises respond to light touch directives Methods include selfregulation and coregulation that may involve commercial interests participating directly with government agencies in designing mechanisms promoting environmental improve ments and sanctioning failures Arrangements can establish non gover nment agencies that act as controlling and monitoring authorities that operate in the shadow of government For example the Australian Packaging Corporation administers the Australian Packaging Covenant as a voluntary agreement between some of the larger packaging manufactur ers and government since to improve rates of recycling for plastic packaging APC A fundamental challenge of such governance arrangements is how to orchestrate the many possible approaches and relationships available on the legal regulatory and governance spectrums Gunningham and Holley Research on good policy practice outlines the fundamentals that need to be observed in the policy process these include clarity of goals consid eration of evidence rigorous policy design stakeholder engagement comprehensive appraisal of options clarity of the role for government including accountabilities and the establishment of review and evaluation mechanisms European Commission The achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs will require wholeofgov ernment approaches and strengthened institutional coordination and coherence at all levels of policymaking This will contribute to ensuring more integrated policy frameworks for sustainable development promote synergies between economic social and environmental policies identify S M JONES tradeoffs and consider transboundary and intergenerational impacts For Nilsson and Harring the identification of synergy and conflict is at three levels policy objectives policy instruments and implementation practices also considering as far as possible outcome and impacts Without these critical elements developing and implementing circular economy objectives on waste will be challenging In order to ensure that these aspects are incorporated into circular economy policies political priority will be critical conclus Ion Waste is increasingly seen as a resource that needs to be reused a business opportunity rather than an unsustainable environmental cost How devel oped countries transition from the current paradoxical approaches to less wasteful less environmentally damaging and more sustainable practices has become a new challenge that requires urgent attention by governments Popular solutions focus on moving from the linear economy take make and throw away to circular approaches that promote the reduction of con sumption and the recycling and reuse of products reducing waste and maximising the use of resources How developed countries transition to sustainable approaches has become a key question of governments in terms of waste policy In its purest form sustainability progressively eliminates waste by keeping resources in continual use Such an approach is a dramatic shift and requires the complete transition from wellentrenched linear approaches that have been the foundations for marketbased economies If stronger regulatory approaches are required in conjunction with tra ditional voluntary measures then an important first step requires govern ments to make policy change a political priority The policy change literature provides some insights on what is required for a policy issue to take priority on a governments agenda For complex and challenging issues political attention alone will be insufficient to ensure political action Baker et al Issues need to have political priority before govern ments commit institutional resources to enacting regulatory interventions Shiffman and Smith A framework influenced by multiple policy change theories will help reveal a range of dimensions and their determi nants that potentially influence and shape political priority The framework proposed in this book consists of four interrelated dimensions political context power of actors the influence of ideas and issue characteristics Kay and Baker argue that the theoretical pluralism of a such a W ASTE MANAGEMENT A POLICY PARADOX framework allows researchers to consider multiple variables and to elabo rate on relationships The book does not intend to establish direct causa tion for policy change but it will outline useful and plausible results without causal inferences As we approach the target date for the UN Sustainable Development Goals in what happens to our waste over the next decade is a critical question for government policymakers Current evidence suggests that we need to prioritise more sustainable approaches over business as usual prac tices Governments signing on to the Paris Climate Agreement are required to develop their own contributions to mitigate against increasing GHG emissions These Nationally Determined Contributions NDCs can include specifics of waste sector mitigation actions that show how indi vidual countries will manage waste in the future Powell et al Examinations of these commitments reveal that of the signatories to the Paris agreement only cite at least one specific waste sector mitiga tion commitment ibid The focus of these actions is largely directed towards improving landfilling and waste processing through incineration ibid This information is somewhat troubling as it shows that less than of signatories intend to take any action to change waste management policy Also troubling is the assumption inherent in any actions or inac tions that governments signing the Paris Agreement seem to have little to no intention of attempting to reduce volumes of waste or shifting from business as usual linear approaches in their economies Recommendations for a shift away from linear to circular approaches to waste management are increasingly popular with government and business throughout OECD countries OECD reports support the transition to circular approaches as a means of putting resources back into environ mental and economic systems and reducing material losses through reus ing and preventing waste OECD a As such the core idea behind the circular economy is not new There is significant overlap with concepts such as industrial ecology the waste hierarchy zero waste and cradletocradle design which have been debated for decades Benn and Giurco Establishing a circular economy will require strong political commitment as it requires significant transitions away from existing busi ness models that rely on the linear approach including the production of waste Such transitions will seem counterintuitive to business that rely on these approaches for their profitability Hood argues that conspicuous consumerism was encouraged at the turn of the twentieth century to redress the imbalance between overproduction and demand S M JONES and that circular policies must now encourage conspicuous non consumption and reuse as the new signifiers of selfworth The next chap ter will outline the essential elements of the circular approach and its relevance to establishing sustainable waste management references Australian Packaging Covenant APC About us Our history Online  Baker P Gill T

Economy  The Promise of the Circular Abstract This chapter focuses on the cir cular economy Of particular interest is the theoretical background to the concept Contemporary gov ernment responses are also outlined with particular attention to the drivers and barriers governments face in implementing policies to promote a cir cular economy The conclusion suggests that governments need to estab lish a political priority for policy change to help ensure that circular approaches can be taken in implementing waste management policies Keywords Circular economy Drivers and barriers Policy change Political priority Introduct Ion The promise of the circular economy is future prosperity based on a closedloop system that will benefit business citizens and the environ ment Milios argues the concept is combining old and well established notions of resource efficiency while making explicit the eco nomic aspect of saving resources and the potential gains it accrues The concept of a circular economy has its roots in industrial ecology which envisions a form of material symbiosis between otherwise very different companies and production processes Andersen Industrial ecology emphasises the benefits of recycling residual waste materials and by pr oducts through for example the development of complex interlink ages such as those in industrial symbiosis projects Transition to the circu lar economy requires cooperation across government industry and society towards key objectives Through the concept of stewardship manufactur ers will be required to rethink how they design products and use resources in more sustainable ways by focusing on binding arrangements that are determined by the entire life cycle of their products Designers and engi neers will be encouraged to focus on innovative resource efficient design that allows products to be easily disassembled and repaired Businesses will be encouraged to look at new business models that prioritise circular activ ities like the prevention of consumption and moving from product sales to the leasing and servicing of products Retailers distributors and manu facturers will all be encouraged to take greater responsibility for reducing waste by supporting the return refurbishment and recycling of endoflife products Consumers will be encouraged to make informed purchasing decisions that create demand for circular and sustainable products and commodities including reusable and durable products and products made from recycled content Increased use of sharing platforms and repair hubs that extend the use and life of a product are also important The reduction of waste and the promotion of recycling industries are critical to circular approaches in collecting waste materials and endoflife products and pro cessing them for use in new products ensuring they remain in the eco nomic loop and their value retained Government policy plays an important role in supporting the transition by industry and society and promoting widespread penetration of circular objectives This chapter outlines cur rent policy focus and discusses the drivers and barriers governments face when choosing to pursue a transition from a linear to a circular economy A cIrcul Ar Economy Researchers and policymakers advocating the circular economy regard it as an alternative to the prevailing model of economic development The con ventional openended system generally known as the linear economy based on the take make and dispose model is unsustainable which Andersen describes in this simple diagram Fig In the model natural resources R are used in production P to develop C consumer goods and capital goods K with the aim of creat ing U utility or welfare This model is seen as problematic and faces considerable challenges in terms of economic social and environmental S M JONES sustainability and as a result so does the modern economic system Korhonen et al The twin issues of reliance on finite resources and the environmental damage caused by waste mean that discussions on the future of the model have been given potency in contemporary debates on climate change mitigation and sustainable development The circular model is discussed as a more sustainable cyclical flow model which reduces negative environmental impact by reducing reliance on virgin resources and recycling existing resources from waste Academically the concept emerges from industrial ecology industrial symbiosis productservice sys tems remanufacturing corporate responsibility sharing economy and zero waste Ranta et al The circular approach places emphasis on product component and material reuse remanufacturing refurbishment repair renewable energy utilisation throughout the product value chain and cradletocradle life cycle Andersen also presents a simple model of a circular model Fig In this model the components of r for recycling and W for waste are added to close the loop so the economy becomes circular Andersen points out that not all waste can be recycled partly due to missed opportunities and partly due to some basic physical laws How such waste can be managed remains a challenging issue involving the potentially environmentally harmful options of landfill and incinerationRP CU KFig The conventional open ended economy Andersen R rP W Environment as waste sinkCUFig The simplified closedloop cir cular economy Andersen THE PROMISE OF THE CIRCULAR The application and focus towards a circular economy in different countries tends to be based on institutional and political factors Studies of the approach in China for example have revealed a topdown focus with a national political strategy with implementation structured following both a horizontal and a vertical approach Zhijun and Nailing Circular policies in China target the different levels of industrialsocietal systems and seem to draw directly from theories of Industrial Symbiosis and Industrial Ecology systems Milios China has been one of the early adopters of the circular approach and there has been an emphasis on ecoindustry ecofarming green services and the reuse and recycling industry In contrast the focus in the European Union EU according to Ghisellini et al has been primarily directed to developing efficient and effective waste management The discourse of zerowaste and the cir cular economy has been championed by key players such as the European Commission EC management consultancies NGOs and multinational companies in recent years Valenzuela and Bhm In this regard a circular economy is primarily discussed through the R principles of the waste hierarchy of reducing reusing and recycling Ranta et al Milios The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD also takes a waste managementbased approach and emphasises resource efficiency and effectiveness as key values In its detailing of circular business models the OECD focus in on the following closing resource loops the diversion of waste from disposal and subsequent transformation into secondary raw materials slowing resource loops or flows the retention of products and their constituent materials in the economy for longer periods and narrowing resource flows generating additional economic value from a fixed amount of natural resources OECD a The OECD recognises that the ideas emphasising sustainability are not new What is new however is the changing circumstances that are driving the need for change as a result of the unsustainable practices established in the linear economy including urbanisation heightened supply risks and evolving consumer preferences The circular model is seen as an effective way to improve efficiency through replacing traditional material inputs with biobased and renewable source materials Ideally however recycled materials should form the bulk of materials used in production processes OECD a S M JONES The promotion of the circular economy by the EU takes a similar focus to that of the OECD Unlike the voluntary guidelines taken by the OECD the EU approach has been to promote the introduction of mandatory legislation with regulations and directives that are binding for member countries In the European Commission released Towards a circular economy A zero waste programme for Europe emphasising the link between the circular economy and waste management The EU claimed the eco nomic benefits of a circular economy would be numerous including enhancing the security of supply for raw materials stimulating GDP growth strengthening the competitiveness of businesses in the EU and helping to protect the environment European Parliament The EU Directive on waste updates a Directive and establishes targets for waste prevention reuse and recycling that reflect the EU ambi tion to move to a circular economy There has been mixed response by member states to the Directive so in The EU argued that it needed to set clear targets to improve performance Many Member States have not yet completely developed the necessary waste management infrastructure It is therefore essential to set clear longterm policy objectives in order to guide measures and investments notably by preventing the creation of structural overcapacities for the treatment of residual waste and lockins of recyclable materials at the lower levels of the waste hierarchy EU The EU Parliament argues that since its original Directive not enough has been done to shift the economy towards more circular practices For this to occur it had become necessary to take additional measures on sus tainable production and consumption The Directive emphasises the important role of municipalities as the countries that perform well in terms of waste management do so because they have developed efficient municipal waste systems The central argument for reform stresses that the more efficient use of resources would also bring substantial net savings for Union businesses public authorities and consumers while reducing total annual greenhouse gas emissions EU Critique of the Directive was directed at what was seen as an overemphasis on recycling over the other pillars of the circular economy particularly the prevention of waste in the first place by changing attitudes to consumption Other issues included promoting the reuse of materials and delinking process with the introduction of policies at all stages of waste production and THE PROMISE OF THE CIRCULAR disposal Mazzanti and Zoboli By focusing on the municipal level the EU again demonstrates that its version of the circular economy is focused on the end of the life cycle with the aim to limit resource loss and increase the circulation of materials mainly through recycling Milios Many member states of the EU adopt their individual policy approach to achieve the targets set in the Directive The EU regulations are taken as a minimum standard and some countries have set higher targets Data collected to measure progress reveals inconsistent levels of recycling landfill and incineration across the EU as illustrated in Fig Research by the European Environment Agency shows that out of EU countries increased their recycling rates by over the period of the Directive In some countries such as Estonia Malta and Serbia the very low proportion of recycled municipal waste barely changed EEA Results suggest that there are inconsistencies in the approaches taken and factors unique to each jurisdiction that impact on the actions taken and the results achieved One clear indicator from the results is the correlation between recycling and landfilling The EEA argues that there is a link between increasing recycling rates and declining rates of landfill ing In countries with high municipal waste recycling rates landfilling is declining much faster than recycling is growing as waste management strategies usually move from landfilling towards a combination of Fig Municipal waste tr eatment EU Switzerland Norway and Iceland Source CEWEP Graph on European Waste Management In www cewepeuinformationdatagraphsindexhtml S M JONES recycling and incineration EEA The EU Directive of rein forces the commitment to waste management as the focus of policy action to move from the EU from a linear to a circular economy New targets reinforce the importance of recycling over landfill the mandatory separa tion of biowaste and the application of the polluter pays principle through extended producer responsibility see Table The EEA figures show widespread support for establishing some form of a circular economy by the majority of EU countries While mandatory mea sures established by the EU have produced mixed results there has been a shift towards a focus on sustainability Much of the enthusiasm for the cir cular economy seems to be fuelled by its alleged benefits for sustainable development Kirchherr et al In Stahel argued that the con cept had not reached any wide implementation stage because policymakers and economic actors know neither the basic principles of a circular approach nor their impact on the economy There has been considerable debate on a clear definition of a circular economy CE Kirchherr et al There is agreement that it is a contested concept Korhonen et al Scholars seem to have reached a common understanding on a metadefinition based on analysis of the circular economy literature Accordingly in the literature there seems to be some agreement that a circular economy Table EU waste management tar gets EEA Waste management Targets and dates Increase

economic system that is based on business models which replace the endoflife concept with reducing alternatively reusing and recy cling materials in productiondistribution and consumption processes with the aim to accomplish sustainable development which implies creating environmental quality economic prosperity and social equity to the benefit of current and future generations Kirchherr et al Both the EU and OECD argue that there is no official definition of the concept of a circular economy EC OECD c The application of the concept becomes problematic when it comes to informing policy processes as it includes specialised terms that are challenging to conceptu alise and operationalise at a policy level Common terms used in relation to a circular economy such as restorative and regenerative are not clear enough in a policy context while superior design is rather an arbitrary term not related to any criteria or assessment Milios Despite the lack of clarity the enthusiasm for a circular economy continues and various policy initiatives have been adopted and implemented by govern ments claiming to be promoting circular over linear approaches PolIcy Focus Which aspect of the circular model a government chooses as its policy focus will be influenced by multiple factors As McConnell argues we need to recognise that governments do policy as well as politics It would be nave to suggest that the processes of policy making or the types of policies chosen are devoid of the political interests of parties or government ibid Policy options are assessed in terms of their poten tial political costs and benefits to government What determines the choice has been the subject of inquiry by policy scientists Policy choice can be influenced by evidence intuition ideology conventional wisdom or at best theory alone Banks Typical circular responses tend to pro mote recycling and support for incineration labelled as waste to energy WtE initiatives Incineration is regarded as another form of disposal because of the pollution generated and the missed opportunities of reus ing valuable resources Governments also make statements about looking for ways to reduce waste through stewardship requirements or zero waste initiatives that are typically based around voluntary arrangements with industry Waste management is seen as critical component of a S M JONES circular economy as it concerns the end point of the manufacturing pro cess where opportunities for economic benefit have been otherwise lost in linear arrangements For the OECD the circular economy is transformative systemic and functional and involves three key aspects It implies behavioural and cultural change towards different produc tion and consumption pathways new business and governance models in a shared responsibility across levels of government and stakeholders It pr ovides an opportunity for complementarities across water waste energy transport housing and land use Inflows and outflows of materials r esources and products require a reaction on the appropriate scale at which the circular economy is applied and on functional linkages across urban and rural areas OECD c OECD member countries have been developing circular policies to promote what they see as a necessary transition to more sustainable approaches Based on the R principles of reduce reuse and recycle these countries have placed emphasis on waste management as the key CE pol icy action The example of Denmark typifies the approaches taken by national governments in the OECD It is the goal that by Denmark will be a society that recirculates materi als and products to the extent that waste no longer exists A society that solely uses the resources that our one and only planet can replace Every country in the world will be forced to go through this transformation which will generate growing global demand for circular technologies and solu tions Denmark City governments also commit to establishing a circular economy pri marily through the adoption to waste management approaches The Canadian city of Vancouver follows the typical pattern of city governments attempting to use the circular economy as a means of marketing their green credentials A graphic illustration of the role waste plays in the OECDs ideas about promoting reduced demand on finite resources can be seen in the impact of circular business model on the linear economy as shown in Fig THE PROMISE OF THE CIRCULAR Countries have adopted a range of policy instruments designed to pro mote a shift towards more circular practices Table provides examples from select OECD countries designed with the aim of reforming waste management practices While there are some commonalities there are also Fig The impact of cir cular business models on the linear economy OECD a Vancouver Zero Waste Strategy With Councils direction and input from residents and stakeholders staff have developed Zero Waste a plan for moving the city towards becoming a zero waste community Moving in this direction increases Vancouvers resiliency to growing demands on limited available waste disposal facilities including the Vancouver Landfill mitigates future risk to Vancouver taxpayers and supports the management of waste materials as resources The Plan recognizes the need for and supports a transition to a more circular economy shifting away from a traditional extractproduceconsumedispose economy to one in which materials remain in circulation By decoupling economic prosperity with the generation of waste this plan provides an opportunity for innovation and attracting new businesses creating more green and inclusive jobs In the long term the implementation of this plan will support the Citys vision of becoming the greenest city in the world and make Vancouver a more resilient city in the face of climate change and increasingly scarce and costly resources VEC S M JONES differences suggesting there needs to be consideration of contextual issues when examining this area of policy Governments examining options for effective policies recognise that individual policies can induce particular desired outcomes In terms of waste management effective circular policies can increase the potential of resource circulation across the different stages of a products life cycle depending on the focus of each policy Research suggests an emphasis on one aspect of circularity such as recycling can act as a barrier to other important elements such as reuse Legislative support for recycling and wastetoenergy measures actually do little to help reduce consumption Research shows that recycling only closes the loop between postuse and production and does not influence the speed of the flow of materials or goods through the economy Stahel To help support policy con sistency and prevent contradictory policy implementation the EU Action Plan for establishing a circular economy recommends the imple mentation of policy measures covering the full life cycle of products from production to consumption to waste management and the market for secondary raw materials EC How countries progress to a circular economy is subject to consider able debate There is a growing literature attempting to identify the main challenges and barriers to the implementation of circular initiatives Galvo et al reveal a range of barriers that fall into categories including Table Select policy instr uments OECD member country Select CE policy instruments Netherlands Landfill ban Pay as you throw pricing Full cost recovery of waste management costs Procurement used as a tool for promoting CEsupport for recycled goods Korea Pay as you throw pricing volumebased waste fee Extended producer responsibility Use of ecolabels for public procurement Target areas where high risk of noncompliance France Legislation on consumption and prevention of planned product obsolescence Product durability legislation Legislated product guarantee Source Author derived from OECD b THE PROMISE OF THE CIRCULAR technical policy and regulatory financial managerial customer and social De Jesus and Mendona examine social regulatory and institu tional barriers and argue that more work needs to be done on identifying the limitations of technical innovation Ranta et al suggest an institutional approach to identify regulative normative and culturalcog nitive pillars that serve as critical barriers Common to these assessments is the view that government policy and regulations are fundamental to whether advances can be made or whether progress remains limited The patchy record of past EU circular policy initiatives in achieving nonlinear sustainable resource use and waste management outcomes sup ports the view that the current package is unlikely to generate the degrees of social economic and technological change required by the circular economy FitchRoy et al Ranta et al examine barriers in China the US and Europe and conclude that the narrow policy and regu latory focus on recycling as one of the pillars of a circular economy stands as a critical barrier to the other pillars of reduce and reuse Given the array of barriers that implementation faces Kirchherr et al successfully disrupting the deeply entrenched unsustainable patterns of production and consumption requires more radical approaches to policy design than circular economy proponents currently acknowledge FitchRoy et al There appears to be a need to shift from current incremental approaches of the past to more radical policy approaches if systemwide change is to occur The material covered so far in this chapter reveals that there are mixed results between countries in achieving even the funda mentals of a circular economy According to the assessments of drivers and barriers to achieving a circular economy government policy plays a critical role The next section examines both the drivers and the barriers to the implementation of a circular economy so we can have a clearer under standing of the current situation particularly as we examine attempts to promote higher levels of sustainable development through applying circu lar principles to waste management drIvErs And BArrIErs Research by the OECD reveals that the market penetration of circular business models remains limited a Countries such as China and the Netherlands are seen to be leading examples Van Buren et al highlight the contribution of government policy to the effec tiveness of circular initiatives for local business They argue that the Dutch S M JONES national government has been actively supporting biobased economy and subsequently circular economy It has become an important pro gramme within the Environmental directory named from waste to resources and in the economic green growth policy A governmental programme has been developed in collaboration with sustainable business associations to explain and promote circular economy to SMEs across the country to provide training and startup support and to communicate best practices Budget has been allocated to scientific research into circular business models Geissdoerfer et al show that a few countries have taken the lead in the conceptual development of a circular economy with China as the topranking country which they argue is not surprising given its legislative approach through the Circular Economy Promotion Law If governments are to move beyond proclamations of their support for a circular economy more radical approaches to policy design are required The OECD a recognises that government policy plays an important role in promoting more widespread penetration of circular approaches If systems of governance are to deliver the radical public pol icy needed then political priority is a critical requirement to facili tate change In the OECD conducted a survey on the status of the circular economy in cities and regions cities and regions and the main tools obstacles and good practices available to date The survey targeted cities and regions at any level of implementation of circular economy ini tiatives from pioneers to newcomers Fig Cultural barriers Regulato ry

Technological solutions Major obstacle Important obstacle Fig OECD Sur vey on circular economy in cities and regions c THE PROMISE OF THE CIRCULAR The survey results highlight the importance of cultural barriers which include public attitudes to consumption waste disposal and recycling as critical to transitioning to a circular economy Similarly financial resources are needed to overcome market failures and facilitate the development of new recycling facilities that may not have established markets The support of government policy that establishes regulatory frameworks that support the transition to a circular economy and promote vertical and horizontal cooperation and coordination of policy initiatives Further research by the OECD reviewed the waste management practices of member countries and the linkage of circular principles to waste The findings support the need for proactive government policy in establishing a regulatory frame work and to reduce barriers to the implementation of circular approaches throughout the waste management process A key barrier to the implementation of a comprehensive and coherent circu lar economy policy mix can be the absence of an effective institutional framework In order to develop and implement policies that support the move to a circular economy OECD countries should seek to build broad government support and interministerial coordination for effective poli cies that address all stages of the materials lifecycle OECD b The OECD elaborates further on these obstacles and recognises seven common barriers and limitations to the adoption of circular models and provides suggested policy responses for governments as outlined in Table conclus Ion Identifying the drivers and barriers to implement circular policies is an important first step to help focus policy priority to areas of relevance and impact There is an emerging literature highlighting implementation issues and this will help identify the areas requiring political priority for the development of relevant waste management policy Ranta et al have undertaken a comprehensive analysis based on an institutional approach and reveal a crosssection of policyrelated issues that can help guide policymakers The attraction of an institutional approach is that it provides a lens that reveals social political and cultural aspects that form a complex asymmetry of factors that help guide political attention and pol icy action Critical to our understanding of political priority an S M JONES Table Common bar riers to circular business model adoption and potential policy response OECD b Barrier Policy response Traditional business models use virgin resources that are cheaper than recycled materialPolicy can help to ensure that the full environmental costs of production and consumption activities are reflected in market prices Design decisions in traditional manufacturing models do not adopt material recovery and product life extension Built in obsolescence reduces useful life of raw and manufactured materialsPolicy can help to improve collaboration within and across sectoral value chains Fostering industrial symbiosis clusters promoting online material marketplaces establishing secondary raw material certification schemes and more generally facilitation of cooperation within and across value chains may be worthwhile initial steps Subsidies and taxes can favour use of natural resources and favour traditional modes of economic productionPolicymakers could consider what objectives existing fiscal policy is serving and whether a fiscal realignment could lead to improved environmental and equity outcomes Status quo biases effectively lend inertia to current patterns of economic development often at the expense of the emergence of circular business modelsPolicy could therefore aim to ensure that existing regulatory frameworks are coherent and fit for purpose and not serving to preserve an existing status quo In some cases the development of markets for circular products and services appears to be held back by a lack of consumer interestPolicymakers could consider how existing educational and information programmes can be improved to provide individuals with a better understanding of the unintended consequences of their consumption choices The use of behavioural insights and nudges such as through labelling requirements may be a promising way forward Policymakers interested in promoting the more widespread adoption of circular business models could implement a range of additional enabling policy measuresExamples of the former include ecodesign standards strengthened EPR schemes and the provision of targeted RD funding Examples of the latter include differentiated VAT rates recycled content mandates product labelling standards and green public procurement Transition to a more resource efficient and circular economy will be at least partially driven by the diffusion of material efficient production technologies and the emergence of more costcompetitive circular business modelsPolicy can influence the composition and therefore the environmental footprint of the rebound effect by ensuring that the full social costs of production and consumption are reflected in market prices THE PROMISE OF THE CIRCULAR institutional approach identifies the regulatory aspects that can both sup port and inhibit the adoption of and transition to a circular economy Ranta et al Examples they provide show how regulations such as a ban on landfill can help to support circular initiatives by discour aging wastefulness and motivating circularity De Jesus and Mendona regard institutional and regulatory factors as soft drivers and bar riers For them the emphasis on public policy measures such as legal frame works taxes incentives and infrastructure development help address market failures as well as supporting opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship that shift the economy to greater levels of circularity Government policy plays the leading role in promoting the institutional framework In their analysis of China the US and the EU Ranta et al found that poorly designed regulatory barriers are one of the most important factors limiting the development of a circular economy Government regulations also impact on the social and cultural factors rel evant to a circular economy For example education campaigns can inform citizens and promote behaviour change to less wasteful practices Well designed evidencebased government regulations can support cultural norms that regard sustainability as an important and desirable aspect of economic activity In addition accurate and appropriate definitions of waste can stem from government policies that identify waste as a resource for reuse and recycling Despite the challenges there is still enthusiasm for the concept of a circular economy as a framework for future sustainable economic develop ment Government policy will continue to be a key aspect future transi tion Policymakers examining methods of establishing circular approaches will operate within the constraints of their institutional arrangements where radical change may not be possible The focus on closing loops places a circular economy at odds with many of the norms logics and routines of the linear economy which in many ways makes it counterin tuitive to established economic patterns for growth Longstanding modes of governing the waste systems have established social institutional and financial arrangements benefiting policy actors and organisations based on linear arrangements Bulkeley et al Pollans The argument of this book is that moving to more effective approaches will require fac ing the challenges and barriers highlighted in the literature Political prior ity needs to be given to move beyond current approaches We need to examine what is required to accord these issues a higher policy priority to help ensure that more radical approaches are adopted Public policy S M JONES literature could provide the answers to this question There is a need for policy design for policy coherence and to broaden the scope of circular policy to reflect all pillars of a circular economy not just recycling For effective transition to occur these matters need to achieve high political priority on the policy agenda of government to promote change In the next chapter a framework based on this literature will be proposed as a means of understanding the complexities of establishing political priority and

Abstract This chapter establishes a multitheory framework to help explain factors and conditions promoting a political priority for policy change The dimensions of the framework are outlined in the context of waste management policy The framework is presented as a tool for analy sis to identify the specific characteristics contributing to the challenge of policy change The conclusion leads to the case study chapters that will adopt the framework to examine the issues faced by governments in adopt ing and implementing circular principles to establish sustainable approaches to waste management Keywords Political priority Framework Policy change waste management policy Introduct Ion In the previous chapters some of the fundamental weaknesses of current approaches to advancing circular objectives have been revealed A focus on end of pipe policies has been at the expense of the other circular objec tives including socialcultural factors particularly the reduction of con sumption and demandside objectives to promote greener practices and more sustainable choices De Jesus and Mendona We have seen that despite the challenges and barriers to effectiveness many governments continue to make commitments to transitioning from a linear to a circular economy model Research shows that in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries with demonstrated commitment to circular objectives the appropriate institutional arrange ments and supporting measures to facilitate the transition were often miss ing OECD While the common approach has focused on waste management particularly recycling other actions include green public purchasing public information and awarenessraising measures and pri vate sector initiatives such as voluntary agreements Achieving effective circular approaches requires policies that address all stages of the materials life cycle The approach adopted by the EU Directive was to support planning as the vehicle for change Research now shows this has contrib uted to the variations in performance of countries in achieving the waste management and prevention targets Johansson and Corvellec This focus of this chapter is to suggest that raising policy priority will be necessary for circular approaches to waste management to become a more central or salient policy commitment Survey research undertaken in of the circular economy plans developed by EU members revealed that more than of policy initia tives are based largely on voluntary measures involving different types of communicative measures in the form of information campaigns cooperation investigation and promotion ibid Close analysis of waste plans across EU countries reveals a disinclination to address the causes of waste generation The ultimate purpose of waste prevention plans should be to break the link between economic growth and the environmental impacts associated with the generation of waste European Commission Yet measures to reduce consumption constitute less than of all measures in the plans At the national and European levels each plan offers only one suggested measure to reduce consumption while none is offered at the local level Hence out of measures only aim to reduce consumption Typical measures for waste prevention in the plans are voluntary and adopt the typical lexicon of policy initiatives that are impossible to measure with any accuracy For example plans merely commit governments to participate in coopera tion give advice examine opportunities develop guidance work to facilitate promote inform identify and coordinate Such measures are soft not legally binding with a low degree of governmental intrusive ness and coercion Most importantly these measures reflect poor policy practice for implementation and managing performance Van Dooren S M JONES et al With these features there is no measurable way to determine if government initiatives actually make a difference relevant indicators are difficult to develop and policies cannot be accurately evaluated as a result policy learning and improvement become extremely difficult Establishing institutions and designing policies to deal with the challenges of transitioning to a circular economy requires an understanding of how policymaking processes work the relevant tradeoffs and the roles of incentives and political barriers to policy implementation Sterner et al Despite government displays of enthusiasm to take policy action there has been a reluctance to adopt regulatory measures Some suggest that the degree of difficulty for regulatory interventions is much higher than for voluntary enabling and educationbased approaches Bulkeley Rosenzweig et al Governments considering mandatory measures can face challenges including perceived adverse effects on industry in terms of employment productivity and profitability Environmental regu lations have been a particular source of debate in terms of their cost and their negative impact on business Dechezleprtre and Sato As an example how to reduce the impact of plastic from causing harm to the environment has become a key challenge for governments Kaza et al For consumers plastic is increasingly impossible to avoid as manu facturers and retailers use it for convenience and durability to avoid con tamination and extend product life Clode When considering appropriate responses to plastic pollution governments have been reluc tant to propose mandatory measures that would reduce the volumes of plastic in the waste stream because of the potential pushback from con sumers business and industry Falkner Clapp Dauvergne argues that the current situation particularly with plastic waste reflects successful industry advocacy of insipid businessfriendly governance interventions under the guise of corporate sustainability con tributing to an overconfidence in the value of individual responsibility and corporate selfgovernance as management principles As a result researchers continue to argue that when dealing with such environmental issues stronger government regulation is pivotal to effective policy change and needs to be stricter with binding targets and timelines Dauvergne Borrelle et al Simon Simes and Marques We will see in this chapter that policy change involves understand ing the political context the role of key actors in the policy process the role of ideas in shaping public acceptance for change and influence of the THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY characteristics of waste as a policy issue This chapter will outline a multi theory framework designed to help understand the complexities associ ated with according these issues a higher policy priority for change A theoret IcAl FrAmework Building broad government support is fundamental to taking the steps necessary towards achieving circular economy objectives to establish more effective ways to prevent and manage waste and support environmental sustainability OECD The argument in this book is that govern ment support alone will be insufficient and political priority for action is required For complex and challenging issues political attention alone will not ensure political action Baker et al Policy change on complex issues requires political priority before governments commit to resourcing interventions Shiffman and Smith If governments are to establish effective policies needed to promote circular from linear economic sys tems ways are needed to be found to promote priority for policy change with stronger regulatory commitments to circular economy objectives that support a focus on consumption and waste prevention Waste preven tion is broadly considered as having greater environmental potential than the dominant waste management practices of landfilling energy recovery and recycling Gentil et al Waste prevention is a policy priority in the EU Directive of and more generally a recommendation from the OECD for the last two decades The policy change literature provides guidance and explanation on potential options and consequences to promote priority for stronger action A framework influenced by multiple policy change theories will help reveal a range of dimensions and their determinants that potentially influence and shape political priority see Table The core argument here is that with political priority the likelihood of policy change towards achieving circular economy objectives will be increased The framework consists of four interrelated dimensions political context power of actors the influence of ideas and problem characteristics Kay and Baker argue that theoretical pluralism as it is applied in the framework allows researchers to consider multiple variables and to elaborate on relationships The framework does not establish direct causation for policy change but outlines a series of determinants from which causal inferences can be drawn No single determinant in the framework is sufficient or necessary to generate priority for policy change but each contributes to increase its S M JONES Table Framework on dimensions of political priority setting Dimension Description Determinants shaping

political priority for regulatory interventions in waste management in Australia Australian Journal of Political Science THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY likelihood Similarly in some instances there may be overlap between the determinants For example there is a recognised link between how policy problems are framed how the problem is understood and the nature of the political action taken It is the proposition of this book that the politi cal priority framework can be used to investigate factors restricting or facilitating more coordinated and regulated policy action in the context of achieving circular economy objectives The books theoretical contribu tion examines how these various parts can integrate to promote or chal lenge policy change In doing so the framework will identify established power relationships among key actors the material structures established to support their power and the ideational framing that contributes to challenging the status quo explAInIng the FrAmework Political Context As a star ting point the institutionalism literature highlights the need to understand political context to guide actors within institutional structures that significantly influence establishing priority to instigate policy change Mintrom and Norman Bell argues that institutions matter in political life More specifically it is about how the behaviour of political actors is shaped and conditioned by the institutional contexts in which they operate Constitutional responsibility sets the context for policymaking it impacts on laws customs and established practices and organisational settings that can be powerful and determining for poli cymaking This is particularly the case in multilevel systems where policy responsibility for specific issues can rest with one level of government As mentioned above responsibility for waste management and environmen tal issues tends to fall to subnational and local governments The frame work highlights three political context determinants essential for raising the priority of policy initiatives The first is the constitutional responsibili ties in multilevel systems Within federal systems subnational govern ments responsibility for waste can contribute to challenges faced by national governments if they attempt to develop consistent national approaches For example state resistance to perceived interference by national governments in Australia and the US has prevented the establish ment of consistent approaches to waste management and the recycling industry Boteler WWF A fiscal imbalance can often ensure S M JONES the financial weight of national governments and their capacity to incen tivise and shape normative behaviour These challenges are intensified in the European Union where subnational or regional governments can limit the consistency of changes to waste policy agreed by the European Parliament The impact of this has been producing inconsistent results across the EU in terms of reducing use of landfill and promoting recycling EEA Constitutional responsibilities within multilevel systems set the context for intergovernmental relations and in the case of waste man agement they have played a significant role in determining challenges for policy change Where political support for policy change is weak even after official adoption of policy decisions implementation will be problematic as ambitious change could face an adverse political and administrative envi ronment The implementation of the waste hierarchy into waste manage ment policy objectives or measures promoting ecodesign recycling and reuse targets for decoupling waste generation from economic growth and extended producer responsibility schemes these may all be seen as means of incorporating circular economy principles into policy and legal frameworks Table outlines the common contextual barriers to implementation emerging from institutional arrangements that may impact on the achievement of government policy change objectives A key barrier to a comprehensive and coherent circular economy policy mix can be the absence of an effective institutional framework to guide policy change According to the OECD in order to develop and implement Table Implementation bar riers Political support and authorisation barri ers Wu et al Slow authorisationPlans and resources mobilisation proceed very slowly due to the existence of multiple veto points among stakeholders in a network making forward progress difficult Weak political supportPlans may proceed and even attain moderate levels of success in the pilot project stage while flying under the radar of key politicians with opposing interests until programme begins to scale up Bureaucratic oppositionKey players in the interagency network tasked with implementing policy slow or sabotage implementation due to low priority of the project lacking incentives or competing interests Poor implementer incentivesLocal implementers local government coordinating executives or frontline staff of agencies who were not consulted during the decisionmaking stage have inadequate buyin or incentives to comply with directives from below THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY policies that support the move to a circular economy governments should seek to build broad government support and interministerial coordination for effective policies that address all stages of the materials life cycle This will address the challenge that action in this sphere goes beyond the remit of environment ministries The OECD policy guidance on resource efficiency underlines that where these institutional arrange ments are in place the shift to a circular economy can be treated as a broader economic policy challenge and integrated across sectoral policy responsibilities Governance structures can therefore shape how an issue will be dealt with and the prominence it can take in the context of other policy issues Contexts are defined as complex assemblies of different elements including interpersonal relations organizational cultures structures and procedures legal frameworks and the political climate Pollitt and Dan Kingdon argues that irregularities produced by either empirical evidence or focusing events provide policy windows where groups or policy entrepreneurs raise problems and have opportunities to promote change The seminal work of Kingdon and the Multiple Streams Framework MSF brings together the dynamics of the context as evidenced by the three streams problems policies and politics to explain why particular policy issues enter the policy agenda and take on added priority Interlinked by the machinations of policy actors the three streams provide a useful tool to begin analysing causal factors behind pol icy change The second determinant in the framework considers the influ ence of institutional context as it involves consideration of government responses to policy windows as they emerge Crisis and elections are often seen as part of the context that can impact on policy as they become pol icy windows for both governments to propose a policy commitment and for interest groups to obtain political attention and make proposals for how the government should respond Kingdon For Baumgartner and Jones their punctuated equilibrium theory sees policy change emerging in moments of abrupt and significant change as windows of opportunity in otherwise long periods of stability Kingdon also recognises the importance of focusing events as policy windows that highlight a problem and feedback on current initiatives that suggests a failure to achieve the original policy goals each provides various indicators to gov ernments that reveal that a problem exists that warrants policy attention Kingdon S M JONES The influence of institutions and the response to windows of opportu nity contribute to a highly complex range of contextual issues that help shape policy change In the context of increasing demands from constitu ents policymakers need to consider the third determinant of the frame work that concerns governance arrangements that increasingly incorporate a wide range of stakeholders that seek to influence policy change The OECD sees governance in terms of relationships The instruments and methods of governance include more than just the functions of public administrators in managing the structures of public institutions Governance encompasses the many and constantly changing sets of rela tionships between the government and the interests of citizens who inter act with public institutions both as individuals and as participants with mutual interests Lovan et al This dynamic emphasises the politi cal nature of policymaking and suggests that the choice of action may be one that faces the path of least resistance rather than the most effective approach to a policy problem In terms of the circular economy this stage will determine the course of action a government will take and which aspects of the circular economy model will be the preferred options for policy In order to help understand this contextual issue Cohen et al proposed their garbage can model of decisionmaking This model applies when there is a very large number of decisionmakers and an uncer tainty about the source of problems and their potential solutions A key concept for this model in that of satisficing based on what Cohen et al regarded as a decision that is satisfactory to the goals and standards of the group of policymakers at the time of the decision Decisionmakers rarely consider the range of policy choices with potentially better results Decisionmakers simply define the goals and choose the means as they go along in a process which is necessarily contingent and unpredictable Howlett and Ramesh Considerable research attention has been given to how public managers need to come to terms with the politi cal context that produces consultative and networked policymaking envi ronments Head Adopting networked approaches is no guarantee that environmental problems will be addressed Making decision through this process may take a long time to produce policy change and achieve direct benefits for citizens Head Many of the most pressing and complex waste problems with links to the advancement of circular econ omy objectives emerge from the realities of the political context of regional and global scales Bodin THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY Power of Actors The framework pr oposes five main determinants for consideration in examining relevant actors to influencing political priority for policy change These determinants borrow from Sabatiers Advocacy Coalition Framework ACF Sabatier which focuses on coalitions of gov ernment and nongovernment actors that engage in coordinated activity to promote the common cause they want to advance For Sabatier events alone are insufficient for longterm change key policy actors are needed in the form of an advocacy coalition that coalesces around a policy issue Advocacy coalitions are portrayed as people from a variety of positions eg elected and agency officials interest group leaders researchers who share a particular belief systemthat is a set of basic values causal assumptions and problem perceptionsand who show a nontrivial degree of coordinated activity over time Sabatier Coalition participants seek to maintain or change policy in particular areas of mutual interest The ACF therefore predicts that the primary determinant of network structure is shared systems of policyrelevant beliefs Members of these coalitions generate policy narratives Whether groups portray themselves as winning or losing the policy narrative con tains some stable policy core beliefs shaped by the cultural context social and economic history and view of the role of government in which the policy issue occurs McBeth et al But other elements of these nar ratives are strategically constructed stories intended to persuade the pub lic andor decisionmakers of the coalitions preferred policy outcome Policy beliefs are a critical element of policy narratives work as a glue to provide focus and purpose and ensure that the coalition is not distracted by internal disagreement regarding the best policy outcomes and the pre ferred policy changes In addition to policy core beliefs the policy narra tives generated by these coalitions harbour divergent narrative strategies depending on whether the coalition portrays itself as winning or losing in the policy subsystem McBeth et al A winners tale constructs a story that seeks to preserve the status quo whereas a losers tale seeks policy change Leadership by policy entrepreneurs helps to unite a policy community through forming a link between formation and maintenance of advocacy coalitions Mintrom and Vergari Policy entrepreneurs can define problems and build teams in ways that maximise opportunities for S M JONES bringing on board coalition partners Meijerink The concept of policy entrepreneurship helps us make sense of what happens in and around policy communities when problems are not able to be readily addressed within existing policy settings But the value of the concept of policy entrepreneurs as change agents is when it is integrated with broader theorisations of the sources of policy stability and policy change Policy entrepreneurs seek to sell their policy ideas and promote dynamic policy change Scholars in agendasetting literature suggest that policy entrepre neurs use several activities to promote their ideas These include identify ing problems shaping the terms of policy debates networking in policy circles and building coalitions Policy entrepreneurs frequently define policy problems in ways that both attract the attention of decisionmakers and indicate appropriate policy responses Kingdon As policy actors entrepreneurs attempt to assemble and maintain coalitions to sup port specific policy ideas which prove to be valuable political resources during discussions of policy change Smith Research also highlights the role of political parties as key actors in facilitating and blocking priority for policy change Walgrave and Varone Carter and Jacobs Political parties are an important feature of policy debate in parliamentary systems as jurisdictions are influenced by agendas established by the major political parties Evidence suggests that unified political party groups are the rule in representative assem blies in parliamentary democracies at the subnational level regional provincial andor local Denters and Klok Dewan and Spirling As an example in Germanys state legislatures an examination of parliamentary voting between and is one of the most com prehensive analyses of party voting at the subnational level and perfect unity was the rule rather than the exception Similarly research by van Vonno on Dutch policymaking shows that political representa tives consider the party meeting the main decisionmaking center and are more likely to engage in consensus and unanimous decisionmaking thus resulting in party agreement being a more important decisionmak ing mechanism Civil society mobilisation in the form of grassroots movements as policy actors often arise in reaction to perceived social injustices and environ mental problems Smith and Seyfang Such actors form networks of activists and organisations generating novel bottomup solutions for sus tainable development solutions that respond to the local situation and the interests and values of the communities involved Seyfang and Smith THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY In contrast to mainstream business greening grassroots initiatives operate in civil society arenas and involve committed activists experiment ing with social innovations as well as using greener technologies Paying attention to effective action in civil society is crucial and encour aging grassroots activism with effective leadership structure and missions is important for policy success Horwitch and Mulloth Studies show that grassroots activism strongly influenced policy change towards the development of clean technology in the US One example is the social activism and social entrepreneurship in New York playing an increasingly important role in the modern innovation process Grassroots activities can be significant for the generation of new and exciting ideas and can repre sent costeffective ways to promote innovation A robust grassroots ecol ogy can be important for revitalisation of a region and a sector Innovation practitioners and scholars argue that policymakers should take social entre preneurship and grassroots activism into greater account In supporting greener business innovation the UK government promoted sustainable consumption through market transformation and the development of more sustainable market choices for products and services DEFRA The UK strategy recognised the contribution of smallscale local activities and has a particular emphasis on delivery of sustainable development at all scales Seyfang and Smith The prime minister stated Many local communities understand the links between the need to tackle national and global environmental challenges and everyday actions to improve our neighbourhoods and create better places to live HM Government In some policy areas the push for change emerges from a coalition of actors outside government that coalesce around a specific issue and lobby for policy change Scholars such as Baker et al argue for the need to recognise industry mobilisation as potential determinant of govern ment acting to change specific policy An economic focus in policy change by governments works in favour of powerful industry stakeholders as advocacy coalitions who continue to support voluntary marketbased approaches as a reflection of economic ideas in structuring policy choices John These views have worked in favour of beverage and packag ing industries who continue to run resistance campaigns to proposals for regulatory approaches arguing that customers will eventually pay for reg ulated changes through increased costs Bertolini et al Wikstrm et al As an example Unilever claims that it has research that shows only of customers care enough about environmental issues to change S M JONES their buying habits This research is used to argue that stronger measures to change behaviour would be resisted by the majority Abboud Over the last two decades new approaches to policy design including co design and copr oduction to promote effectiveness in an economically efficient manner have seen the emergence of stronger links between indus try and government Durose and Richardson As an example Germanys federal political system and corporatist traditions have given sectoral industry interests privileged access to the political system Hey Viewing the management of waste as an industry policy implies waste diversion is the preferred option which benefits vested inter ests seeking to expand economic opportunities in recycling landfill and energy Election commitments by the Australian government in allocating funds to identifying wasteprocessing technologies that for example create new sources of energy maintain the economic frame where waste is a resource that industry can exploit for economic benefits Influence of Ideas The framework pr oposes that support for policy change can be influenced by the way actors frame ideas or the way in which an issue is understood or portrayed publicly Hoffman and Ventresca How an issue is framed contributes to how it resonates with stakeholders which can help move essential individuals and organisations to action especially political leaders who control the resources that policy initiatives need Shiffman and Smith Beland suggests that ideas can take the form of economic and social assumptions that either legitimize or challenge existing institutions and policies Waste management is cur rently viewed largely through the economic ideas that frame waste as a resource that needs to be managed for its value As a key objective for the circular economy approach effective management of waste is seen as an important contributor to longterm sustainable economic growth One of the central narratives of the circular economy is the idea that radical institutional and policy transformations are needed to establish competi tive economies in the future Lazarevic and Valve Economic solu tions to environmental problems reflect the neoliberal approach towards social and environmental policymaking which has sought to roll back the states role to look for solutions through marketbased measures As an example landfill has traditionally been the responsibility of local govern ments as the least desirable form of disposal because of the production THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY and release of methane which contributes immensely to climate change EPA Governments advocating for establishing a circular econ omy view landfill as a source of missed economic opportunities for indus try that can benefit from waste where the value of products materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible European Parliament In Kingdons MSF analysis ideas contribute to the construc tion of the issues and problems that enter the policy agenda When policy makers frame a problem it can dictate how it will be treated Ideational processes help provide the explanation for a dynamic approach to policy change in which change or continuity is possible through ideas and dis cursive interaction in politics Kangas et al Ideas have a role in helping to shape the policy agenda How a problem is framed will deter mine who is invited to participate in the policy process by government Whether waste is framed in economic or environmental terms will also influence which stakeholders seek to contribute to influencing the policy change For example how a government frames waste as a problem will shape the way it will be examined and the potential solutions pursued Theoretically the focus of waste prevention policy should be on weaken ing the relationship between cause economic growth and effect genera tion of waste rather than the drivers behind waste generation Framing can help to convince policymakers interest groups and the general popu lation that policy action is necessary Cairney Barr et al argue that as many environmental concerns become increasingly framed within a climate change agenda waste retains an important place as a visible illustration of the overconsumption that scholars and practitioners alike have blamed for contributing to a longterm environmental crisis Greyl et al Dauvergne According to Beland ideas about the most pressing issues of the day help actors to narrow down the list of issues on the policy agenda Ideas contribute to the construction of the social economic and environmental problems that political actors may address ibid Agenda setting is about a government recognising that a problem is a public problem worthy of attention It is often considered the most criti cal stage in the policy process as governments can only address a limited number of public problems at any particular time Wu et al There is more likelihood of policy change if an issue reaches the govern ments policy agenda The main actors involved in agenda setting com monly emerge from a collective of actors such as interest groups religious S M JONES groups industry representatives unions associations and think tanks Elections provide opportunities for these actors to pressure political par ties to commit to act on their issues Focus is on a problem that needs attention and the policy actions that can be taken to resolve it places demand for action by government Peretz argued for the impor tance of defining the policy problem in the first instance Correct problem definition is paramount as it guides the agenda building process It directly influences the alternatives debated the political willingness to advocate a change and the policy that emerges Perez For Rochefort and Cobb a problems dimensions guide the agenda building pro cess They suggest that difficulty in accurately assessing a problems sever ity and likely consequences has plagued environmental decisionmaking as has difficulty in distinguishing between a mere problem and a crisis Solutions can often shape the action taken by policymakers Policymakers will be more inclined to act on a problem if a solution is thought to be available acceptable and affordable hence the economic framing Deciding what an issue is all about and how serious a problem is can lead to conflict moreover policy problems are matters of interpretation Nevertheless it is crucial that these problems be interpreted correctly Interpretation directly influences the alternatives debated the political willingness to advocate change and the policy that emerges Problem Characteristics The final dimension of the framework involves how the characteristics of the problem shape policy priority The framework suggests three key char acteristics that contribute to whether decisionmakers decide if policy change is necessary indicators show policy action is needed severity of an issue calls for a policy response and policy intervention can be shown to produce the necessary change Some issues are easier to manage for exam ple comparatively straightforward issues where policy action can be mea sured and progress reported Van Dooren et al Shiffman and Smith argue that problems that cause substantial harm will be treated as more serious by policymakers Similarly problems that policy makers can address effectively and cheaply for example investment in vac cines to improve childrens health will more likely receive political attention ibid Kingdon identifies problem as one of the three streams in his MSF approach He argues that governments have a long list of problems that they could attend to and that decisionmakers pay THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY attention to some problems and ignore others Sometimes their attention is affected by more or less a systemic indicator of a problem At other times a dramatic event seizes their attention or feedback from the opera tion of existing programmes suggests all is not well ibid The establishment of indicators relating to environmental sustainabil ity has been a global issue with international commitments Indicators of relevance to the transition to a circular economy including the stateof the envir onment indicators established by the UN help to monitor prog ress against the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs including goals of direct relevance to a circular economy Goal namely Sustainable Cities and Communities and Goal namely Responsible Consumption and Production These indicators have been tested in actual policy processes Herzi and Dovers and often supported with institutional and policy arrangements such as crossjurisdictional committees and councils or units within government institutions Most recent reports by the UN show that indicators are revealing that while there has been some progress it is not at sufficient speed to realise the SDGs by UN Individual countries are required to measure progress against the indicators and make policy change where necessary to achieve the overall SDGs Scholars argue that for indicators to be effec tive in contributing to policy change they need to be perceived simulta neouslyconsensuallyby a group of policy actors as being legitimate credible and salient Bauler Importantly the level of the policy actors perceptions influences the usability of indicators and their subjec tive judgement of the indicators qualities The usability and quality of indicators is thus a matter of subjective judgement at the level of the policy actors themselves ibid An example of the need to establish usable indicators that have the support of policymakers is the European Commission EC Circular Economy Monitoring Framework European Commission The Monitoring Framework is a set of indicators that cover the different phases of the circular economy These circular indicators can be used by member countries to show if the existing policy initiatives are successful in delivering the expected results andor to identify areas where more action is needed ibid The indicators include elements of waste management as well as innovation and economic growth which some argue highlights the attempt to mainstream waste management into economic narratives Giampietro et al Concerns were raised by member countries that that the indicators tend to be skewed towards S M JONES waste managementrelated information at the expense of other phases of the circular economy such as production consumption reuse and repair thereby missing out on some important transformation trends and eco nomic opportunities The EU argues that there is an absence of available data or even methodologies to measure these aspects European Commission As a result for the foreseeable future it is neces sary to work with other available information that may give some more indirect indications of performance ibid The focus on waste manage ment by the EU will continue to be supported by the availability of the indicators that measure progress Without the indicators to support other circular economy objectives there will be longterm implications for the policy change needed for a transition to a circular economy and the estab lishment of more sustainable use of resources will remain challenging This dimension of the framework also points to the severity of a policy problem prompting policy change In the case of the circular economy the crisis relating to recycling practices in many OECD countries has cre ated a situation where governments have been forced to respond Interestingly in some cases indicators in countries such as Australia Canada the US and the UK had been suggesting the existence of prob lems in the recycling industry since the s but governments avoided responding to the issues until they became so severe that political priority for policy change became urgent Tierney Hook and Reed As a result the focus on waste management as a key problem for the transition to a circular economy has been driven by the calls for govern ment action to respond to the crisis situation Dominating debates about the circular economy revolves around the burden of managing growing volumes of waste and the waste as resource paradigm to support the idea that economic opportunities are being missed as a result of current prac tices Dijkema et al What should be done about managing waste has become the central problem rather than how to prevent waste in the first place The MSF suggests that any given policy problem has an improved chance of rising in the policy agenda as a political priority if coupled with another pressing preexisting problem Kingdon The combination of a crisis situation coupled with the problem of missed eco nomic opportunities has reinforced the need for a policy response These arguments contribute to the framing of waste as an economic problem that warrants a joint government and industry response Since the s a shift from an environmental to economic focus helps to reinforce waste as an issue of resource management which can be measured with THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY reportable results in terms of rates of recycling or transformed into alter native products or energy produced Gregson and Crang The reportable results of jobs created and money generated have become attractive stories for policymakers and are used to demonstrate effective approaches to dealing with the issue and help to justify the effectiveness of government intervention In the third aspect of this dimension of the framework policymakers may recognise an opportunity for according issues a higher policy priority on the basis of evidence that government intervention may be successful and in keeping with political objectives In terms of circular economy government plans and strategies where they exist may outline govern ment involvement in promoting the development of waste industry This intervention can involve direct participation for example building and operating waste facilities usually the domain of municipal governments Other levels of government may provide incentives if evidence suggests that this will encourage private sector investment Arguably in linking this policy response requiring evidence to the severity issue the recycling crisis has prompted this form of action in some countries Governments are able to provide evidence based on market failure arguments when politically expedient to support such interventions citing government and industry reports that support making the issues a policy priority Such actions are easy to explain simple to implement and relatively inexpensive and inter vention can be justified in terms of both economic and environmental outcomes A recent report produced through the European Unions Horizon Research and Innovation Programme suggests the popu larity of these actions are largely as a result of the circular economy being a nexus policy because it is an attempt to reconcile economic interests with environmental concerns Giampietro et al Pressure from industry also supports the view that more recycling is good Many stakeholders support these arguments on the basis of the potential growth of the recycling industry and for the underlying assump tion that nothing else needs to change in terms of other circular economy objectives for example reducing consumer spending if products can be recycled Government can provide data that reveals industry employment opportunities annual revenues generated for every tonne of waste that is recycled and the number of new jobs created DEE These fig ures are attractive as governments also view waste as a potential source of revenue Thus recycling becomes attractive for both industry and con sumers Similarly the evidence supporting waste to energy projects S M JONES focuses on the savings made in terms of reduced need for landfill and the potential to replace fossil fuels as an energy source UNFCC Such interventions are relatively easy for governments as they only need to iden tify incentives for the private sector to invest in these forms of waste man agement Different stakeholders within the business NGOs and government sectors are likely to have divergent views and evidence In these circumstances government actors play a major role in the issue naming blaming claiming and framing either formally through their contacts with societal actors or informally through their influence over the media think tanks or academia Wu et al Viewing waste as an industry implies that waste diversion is the preferred solution to the problem of managing increasing volumes of waste which benefits vested interests seeking to expand economic opportunities in recycling landfill and energy Bulkeley and Gregson Ignoring consumption curtails the capacity of waste prevention plans to prevent the generation of waste polIcy chAnge Once political priority is recognised policy change should be facilitated through the policy process This too has its own challenges and has been the focus of a long history of research The analysis of the policy process is largely based in Eastons systems theory of the stages approach According to this view political systems consist of inputs demands from individuals and groups for governments to act and supports largely voting and obedience to laws and the payment of taxes Hill These inputs pass through a conversion stage to produce outputs and out comes in the form of decisions and policies A feedback loop forms the last stage where the outputs of the process shape future inputs to the system ibid The stages approach provides a series of points of analysis that have contributed to a large body of policy analysis literature that recog nises the complex and elaborate nature of policymaking Wu et al argue that policy activities do not occur in a linear progression they are discrete albeit interrelated sets of activities that public managers can engage in to achieve societys and governments policy goals The formulation of policy involves the identification of a possible course of action governments can take to address the problems on the agenda Options need to be politically acceptable administratively feasible and technically sound Wu et al argue that policymakers are most often pressured to choose options that are deficient only marginally different THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY from existing policies or to take no action at all Many governments estab lish guidelines for their policymakers when formulating public policy these often clarify that the government executives remain firmly in con trol Here is an example from Northern Ireland that places policymaking in the context of the obligations of elected government Policymaking is the process by which governments translate their political vision into programmes and actions to deliver outcomesdesired change in the real world It is about establishing what needs to be doneexamin ing the underlying rationale for and effectiveness of policiesthen working out how to do it and reviewing on an ongoing basis how well the desired outcomes are being delivered Institute for Government Definitions such as this reflect political expediency governments vision with some deference to due process effectiveness and review Policy formulation involves key actors in the policy process including the political executives individual legislators and senior officials of the key government agencies involved with the issue or problem One essential part of the formulation stage is the policy design which includes planning of the implementation stage Howlett This implies that once pol icy priority is decided policymakers decide which tools and instruments they intend to use and what financial and human resources they should allocate Translating these visions and plans into achievable policies consti tutes one of the greatest challenges in policymaking and is a strong indica tor of the level of priority the problem has reached for the government Policymakers have to decide which combination of policy instruments can best be deployed to influence the content and effect of policy action to address a problem and implement a solution OECD evidence highlights the importance of regulatory policy and governance to ensure that regula tions meet the desired objectives and new challenges as efficiently as pos sible OECD As a reflection of political priority for waste management governments tend to establish regulatory instruments that set rules to govern waste streams require authorisation for treatment facil ities and set standards for their operation according to best available tech niques In addition several countries have introduced landfills bans to promote recycling and recovery Some OECD countries have also used economic instruments such as landfill and incineration taxes which can promote recycling and reduce landfilling Full cost recovery for municipal waste services is in place in some OECD countries but remains to be addressed in others OECD S M JONES Governments need to decide to take a course of action or nonaction to deal with the policy problem Wu et al Following the for mulation of possible courses of action governments make the decision on which option to take Scholars recognise that decisions are made follow ing consideration and a small number of options and that politics plays a major role in the process The definition of decisionmaking established by Brewer and DeLeon provides some insights on this process It is the most overtly political stage in so far as the many potential solutions to a given problem must somehow be winnowed down and but one or a select few picked and readied for use Obviously most possible choices will not be realized and deciding not to take particular course of action as much a part of selection as finally setting on the best course Evaluation is a critical element of the implementation of policy as it involves the assessment of whether original objectives have been achieved A willingness to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of a policy or pro gramme reflects political priority to ensure policy change Rutter argues that real change will come when politicians see evidence and evalu ation as ways of helping them entrench policies The results and recom mendations of evaluation can be introduced to new stages of policymaking and depending on political priority can contribute to the refinement of policy design or to the termination of a programme Wu et al Accurate data is needed to improve the policy base for policy development implementation and evaluation Several Environmental Performance Reviews conducted by the OECD identified a need for better data collection and quality assurance and the use of goodquality indicators showing the need for policy change In many countries data sets are not complete Inconsistencies in definitions and data collection methods make comparison across countries difficult Effective information systems are a key tool for policy action Wu et al warn that policy evaluation is also a political process that can be used to disguise or conceal the results of policy action Evaluations can be used for political purposes to prevent critique and lead to preferred conclusions For example some governments rely on poorquality data on recycling largely provided by the packaging industry to suggest that there is limited recognition for increasing the political prior ity for policy intervention Pickin NGOs can also undertake their own evaluations that help to reveal poor performance when governments are attempting to use selected data for political advantage ABC THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL PRIORITY conclus Ion Policy action to transition from a linear to a circular economy model requires the commitment of political leaders to prioritise the mobilisation of official institutions and wider policy systems into resourcing regulatory interventions commensurate with social economic and environmental challenges The prime focus of most government policy has been on recy cling and reducing resource loss Research shows mixed results due to varying levels of political commitment to deal with the challenges and bar riers to reform Commitments to develop and implement effective waste management policies including prevention will contribute to establishing the circular economy objectives of environmentally sustainable practices of consumption and the effective management of waste Equitable and sus tainable responses will require a strong role for government Keskitalo et al The following chapters will examine two case examples of the governments of Belgium and Norway that have given a degree of policy priority to aspects of the circular economy Their examples will be consid ered in the context of the issues discussed in this chapter Of critical impor tance is their experience and the lessons they provide for other governments in multilevel systems contemplating according to these issues a higher policy priority by adopting regulatory approaches to help ensure a stronger policy response for the commitments made to circular objectives reFerences Abboud L Can we break our addiction to plastic The future of packag ing Financial Times

establish a circular economy Of particular relevance is the implementation of sustainable approaches to waste management The contribution of the multilevel nature of the Belgian political system is highlighted in discussing approaches to policy development and implementation Challenges and opportunities for the adoption of further aspects of the circular model beyond recycling are also discussed Keywords Belgium Flanders Br ussels Wallonia Circular economy Waste management Introduct Ion Since the mids Belgian governments have developed wellorganised waste management systems based on the circular economy principles of reduce reuse and recycle Federal and regional legislation supports policy instruments governance arrangements funding sanctions planning and data collection After years of experimentation and review of waste man agement practices Belgium now has some of the highest rates of recycling in the European Union EU Eurostat b As a result of the waste prevention and diversion strategies the Belgian region of Flanders has some of the most effective waste prevention results in Europe EEA Belgium as a whole met the EU recycling target in EEA The transformation of Belgian waste management systems has been the result of a topdown strategic approach by regional governments in order to meet and often go beyond EU requirements For Belgiums million citizens the system places considerable responsibility on both households and industry by establishing a high level of sorting and reuse a collection system based on maximum source separation a landfill ban for household waste direct charging of householders for waste disposal sig nificant use of home composting producer responsibility schemes for household packaging and other wastes and legislated limitations on incineration Waste Manage Ment In BelgIuM Policy Context Belgium is a federal state comprising thr ee regions Wallonia Flanders and BrusselsCapital waste management is a matter for the regions Brussels Capital Region represents of the municipal waste generated in Belgium Flanders and Wallonia EEA The Belgian state is the legal entity responsible for compliance with EU legislative requirements for waste Regional governments are not subordinate to the federal level and are within their constitutional right to deal directly with the EU on waste issues As in the European Waste Framework Directive waste is defined by the three regional governments as any substance or object which the holder discards Belgian regions have implemented the EU pro visions relating to byproducts and end of waste status As an example the Materials Decree of on the prevention and management of waste substances lays the foundation of a coordinated and permanent waste policy in Flanders Through a series of amendments the decree evolved gradually from final removal or destruction of waste to prevention and useful application VLAREA Flemish Regulation concerning Waste Prevention and Management implements the Waste Decree The Implementation Plan for Environmentally Responsible Household Waste Management UMBHA established the general guidelines for Flemish municipalities for the prevention separate collection and treatment of household waste The updated version provides local councils S M JONES with ideas and tools to collaborate with the residents associations and com panies from your municipality to achieve more waste prevention and reuse a better sourceseparated collection and recycling and less litter In this manner we will jointly work together towards a beautiful and material conscious Flanders showing in Eur ope at the top regarding its waste policy OVAM In Belgium there has been a tendency by governments to streamline waste legislation into one code in terms of inspection prevention deter mination and sanctioning of environmental issues For example the coop erative agreement between the three regions and the packaging sector was established in for recovering and recycling the packaging waste The current version of the Cooperation Agreement of on the preven tion and management of packaging waste Agreement argues it is essential for all parties involved in the production use import and dis tribution of packaged goods to become more aware of the significance of packaging in generating waste and whereas these parties assume responsi bility for such waste according to the polluter pays principle IVCCIE b This Agreement is based on mandatory stewardship requirements for packaging waste throughout Belgium where packagers importers and those who sell packaging and packaged products bear responsibility for reuse and recycling of packaging waste The Agreement is applicable to the disposal and treatment of both household and industrialcommercial packaging waste In reflecting its multilevel character each Belgian region has its own ministry with responsibility for environmental issues including waste management Competencies for environmental issues are exclusive to the regional governments No federal authority has precedence over the regions exercise of environmental powers The introduction of circular economy initiatives focused on waste and recycling by the EU has been reflected by each of the governments of Belgium The Belgian govern ment introduced measures towards establishing a circular economy in Belgium Flanders introduced the Circular Flanders Together towards a circular economy Kickoff Statement OVAM a Wallonia introduced its Strategy for the deployment of circular economy in Wallonia and Brussels City introduced the Brussels Capital W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM region circular economy strategy in Brussels By dividing responsibility between intergovernmental agencies municipal govern ments and industry regional governments have implemented strategies for circular initiatives for waste prevention recycling and composting Importantly this has not prevented regions forming joint arrangements for mutual activities and countrywide focus to achieve common goals Recognition of the benefits of coordination and cooperation have been drivers of an interregional agreement on waste reduction and recycling Regional governments have each established autonomous agencies with specific responsibility for waste policy In Flanders Belgiums largest region the government established the Flemish Public Waste Agency OVAM as the competent authority for solid waste established covering waste management and prevention see Fig OVAMs main task is to prepare waste management legislation on behalf of the Flemish minister responsible for the environment Once the legislation is approved by the Flemish government OVAM supervises and coordinates the implementa tion of waste management across the region OVAM is also responsible for waste management planning OVAM positions itself as an organisation for active environmental management that prefers dialogue to build partner ships and to reach a consensus with its target audience so that mutual support and capacity is created for a sustainable environment OVAM a Much of the work of OVAM including results is reasonably well Fig Competent authority for waste management in Flanders Sour ce Author derived from OVAM b S M JONES documented and publicly available and forms the basis of this case study Where possible reference is also made to activities in the other regions and to interregional initiatives All data regarding waste production and waste treatment in Flanders are collected at the central databases of OVAM it uses the data to set perfor mance targets and provides investment subsidies to municipalities and intermunicipal associations for waste prevention separation and treat ment In there were Flemish municipalities responsible for municipal solid waste almost all of them have grouped themselves into associations to provide these services collectively Municipalities are respon sible for implementing the UMBHA and the Separate Collection of Industrial Waste from Small Enterprises plan as required by OVAM UMBHA establishes the general guidelines for the prevention separate collection and treatment of household waste OVAM sets targets and signs agree ments with municipalities regarding source separated collected waste residual waste bulky waste and street and sweeping waste litter and waste from street dustbins Municipalities are also required to deal with industrial waste similar to household waste that is waste from businesses of a nature composition and quantity similar to household waste OVAM b The obligations for municipalities include conducting waste prevention campaigns provide technical or financial assistance to citizens to reduce waste sponsor specific campaigns for target groups like schools and so on This has been done by way of intermunicipal cooperation since the mid s wher eby a group of municipalities merge their waste manage ment activities within one single organisation or intermunicipal partner ship A few cases of mixed intermunicipal partnerships also exist which include the participation of a private company Fifty per cent of household waste collection in Flanders is also outsourced to private waste companies Agreements between municipalities and OVAM often include subsidies to finance public education campaigns as well as home compost programmes and school education programmes Despite efforts to produce consistent national approaches ongoing historical differences for recycling rates for municipal waste exist between Brussels Capital Region Flanders and Wallonia Recycling rates for material and organic recycling are highest in Flanders throughout the period whereas Wallonia has made most progress EEA Low performance in the capital is explained by the lack of infrastructure for the treatment of organic waste and lack of collectionrecycling infrastructure related to the high urban density Zeller et al W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM Ideas and Appr oaches Taken During the s there was a high level of resistance and opposition by part of the Flemish population to landfilling and incineration of waste Belgian regions have some of the highest population densities in the EU Chepkemoi Identifying locations for new landfill and incineration options created a situation of strong opposition from local residents RR In the context of European environmental agendas at the time this made waste an important target of ecomodernisation and infrastruc ture investment Savini Lack of options in Belgian regional areas created a situation of rising costs for the collection and treatment of the municipal solid waste and municipalities were forced to find new ways to finance those costs In responding to this policy window the Flemish gov ernment recognised that the establishment of both a ban on landfill and a landfill tax marked the beginning of a transition to new ideas to waste management at the regional level The banning of landfill along with strict limitations on incineration by the three regions placed added responsibil ity for municipalities to align their restrictions The main objective has been around environmental ideas to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill to limit greenhouse gas emissions and risks of soil contamination while pushing the recycling or composting of wastes According to OVAM the incineration ban has been adopted in order to provide a counterbal ance to the landfill ban by ensuring that incineration does not become the only way of dealing with waste and that efforts in waste prevention and recycling still get continuous support EURELCO In addition to waste prevention strategies Flemish municipalities have introduced Pay As You Throw PAYT requirements at the household level By the mids these schemes were being introduced in other countries including the United States in large metropolitan areas such as San Francisco Seattle and San Jose Wright et al In the Flanders model the most expensive aspects focused on the collection of residual waste followed by the collection of the household biodegradable waste to stimulate the home composting with lowest taxes applied to plastic bottles metal packaging and drink cartons PMD The separate collec tion of paper and cardboard container glass and textiles would be free The idea behind PAYT is to stimulate citizens to take some responsibil ity and sort their waste correctly into different recyclable waste streams by making waste sorting financially more attractive Elements of PAYT vary S M JONES among intermunicipality associations Some charge for bags that cover the costs of collection while others use bins with electronic chips that charge according to the volume or weight of the waste For larger contain ers there is taxation per volume and per pick up In this way more waste could be reused recycled or composted with less waste going to final treatment incineration or landfill The aim has evolved with the goal to recycle as much as possible waste materials in accordance with the Materials Decree after being used by the households and to produce less resid ual waste Tax on other waste streams varies depending the quantity The use of the landfill tax had a significant effect on the reduction of the land filling rate and did not affect significantly the incineration rate the landfill tax has been a driver for diverting waste from landfilling directly to recy cling EEA OVAM has established financial incentives for the purchase of second hand goods as stated in the Flemish waste pr evention programmes Belgium introduced a reduced VAT rate applicable to reused products rather than the usual for new products The tax differentiation is mainly justi fied by social reasons but it also supports the redistribution repair and refurbishment of used products that can then compete more easily with new products Research shows that taxes are effective in improving rates of recycling but do little to reduce consumption Morlok et al The combination of PAYT schemes with incentives to support waste prevention plans and tax regulations and more targeted actions at the local level such as awarenessraising campaigns reuse initiatives secondhand markets repair cafes support reuse and promote lower levels of consumption The high reuse rates in Flanders underline the effects of an integrated approach to support reuse with appropriate economic instruments EEA OVAM provides subsidies to support municipalities construction and man agement of waste dropoff centres and compost plants implement PAYT systems and other activities In Flanders the municipalities are subsidised for implementing the PAYT principle The municipalities are subsidised for containers including a weighing system for doorto door collection of residual or biodegradable household waste Also civic amenity sites are subsidised Local authorities can build their facilities in a way they can charge the citizens depending on the quantity and type of waste they deposit Flemish subsidies since the s have supported the infrastruc ture necessary for the separate collection of the MSW at source for exam ple civic amenity sites and composting facilities OVAM also conducts W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM regular education campaigns for citizens and industry that reinforce the message that leaving behind waste is socially unacceptable OVAM OVAM regards enforcement as the cornerstone of any policy Sanctions must be visibly clear out in the field that no form of litter and illegal dumping will be accepted anymore OVAM Enforcement has been interpreted in broad terms not only fines can be imposed munici palities can also challenge violators concerning their behaviour and increas ing social control Sanctions for noncompliance are stringently applied in other regions For example in the Bruxelles Capital Region fines up to for noncompliance were introduced in Fines are in place for a range of failures to comply including taking rubbish bags outside of the authorised collection daystimes and nonsorted or noncompliant bags In addition the local government in Brussels has a range of criminal sanc tions enforced through the BruxellesPropret Officers with powers of investigation similar to those of the police and sometimes even larger ensure compliance Prosecutions are heard before a Magistrates court or refer the case to BruxellesPropret which can impose administrative fines Administrative fines can reach Their amount is set by a Decree on the investigation detection prosecution and punishment of offences relating to the environment Policy Actors The association of all municipalities and cities in Flanders VVSG has a focus on achieving the SDGs It r epresents their interests to central gov ernment and negotiates sustainability issues on their behalf and with rec ognised bodies of producers with producer responsibility obligations OVAM is the Public Waste Management Agency in Flanders which coop erates with municipalities OVAM coordinates this cooperation represent ing Flemish municipalities and intermunicipal waste management organisations in negotiations with administration cabinet officials and industry In a short time OVAM has become a prominent stakeholder on municipal solid waste management for the regional government and offi cial departments Through the household waste implementation plan OVAM expects that between and Flemish municipalities will reduce the total quantity of residual waste from households companies and organisations It will do this by imposing various targets of residual waste for each cluster S M JONES of municipalities The implementation plan imposes new targets for waste prevention reuse litter illegal dumping and industrial waste in Flanders OVAM recognises the contextual pressure placed on municipalities regard ing waste management With the implementation plan municipalities are encouraged to customise their approach to suit local circumstances Targets for reducing household waste have been tailormade to suit socio economic cir cumstances of individual municipalities For example coastal municipalities are assigned a less stringent target since they produce more residual waste due to tourism than rural municipalities OVAM The cooperative packaging Agreement is administered by the Interregional Packaging Commission IVCCIE which undertakes supervision and advisory roles to each regional waste authority including OVAM The IVCCIE has contracted Fost Plus to coordinate with pack aging manufacturers to collect and process packaging from households and ValIPac has been contracted to process industrial and commercial packaging waste These organisations are membership based and work together with packaging manufacturers to achieve the government recy cling targets Fost Plus was established in as voluntary initiative of private sector organisations Companies that bring packaged household products onto the Belgian market join up with Fost Plus and pay an annual contribution based on the quantity and type of their packaging Fost Plus uses this contribution to collect sort and recycle the packaging after use In addition to these contributions Fost Plus also generates income from the sale of the materials collected and uses the revenue for continuous education campaigns for citizens regarding correct sorting rules RR The revenues from the sale of collected materials together with the member contributions must cover all the collecting and sorting costs Fost Plus Members include major packaging firms such as Unilever Coca Cola Carrefour Total Proctor and Gamble and Danone Fost Plus Participating companies pay a fee based on the type and amount of packaging they are responsible for introducing into the market The organisation funds the public collection sorting and recycling of these materials This programme covers the entire nation and is moni tored In household packaging was processed by Fost Plus in Belgium or in Belgium with processed in neighbouring countries the Netherlands Germany and France and in the rest of Europe Only a very limited amount was processed outside Europe Fost Plus W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM Ef fective Policy Action Waste management in Belgium seems to be proving effective While there may be differences between the regions in terms of objectives and approaches taken the overall results as reported by the EU Table show that Belgium is well above the European average for recycling and well below average for landfilling In its report the IVCECIE detailed recycling and recovery figures and the monitoring of reusable packaging throughout Belgium The recycling and recovery results for for household packaging waste were for recycling and for incineration for energy recovery with the residual being sent to landfill IVCCIE a ValIPac achieved a recycling rate by its members of for plastic papercardboard metal and wood against a target of Recycling by industry has been improved through the policy support for reusable packaging The implementation of landfill bans and limita tions on incineration supported by tax incentives and financial sanctions for noncompliance contribute to Belgium being the best overall perfor mance across the EU in waste treatment see Table These aspects of the Flemish policy and the scale of the Flemish contribution to the overall result make Flanders the leading contributor to the Belgian recy cling scores The trend from to shows improvement in the reuse of materials particularly wood see Fig The implementation of the incineration bans has also been successful these bans have reduced Flanders dependency on incineration of residual waste compared to years ago from in the share of incineration is now just and seems to have been stable since For household waste the combination of PAYT and incentives focused on reuse has contributed to a reduction in per capita household residual waste see Fig This continues to be a focus for the government and OVAM as their data suggests that further reductions will need to be made to reduce landfill and incineration rates even further The IVCCIE has set new objectives for recycling by at least of beverage packaging waste must be collected and recycled and by at least of household packaging waste ValIPac has been set the objective of reducing residual waste the material that cannot be recy cled from companies away from landfill or from export Belgian regional governments argue that they uphold

developing a domestic capacity for recycling has been effective Belgiums exposure to the consequences of Chinas National Sword policy has been tempered by the waste management practices established under the intergovernmental Agreement Fost Plus figures show that of package recycling takes place in Belgium or a neighbouring country see Fig thus reducing exposure to the bans placed by South East Asian countries OVAM argues that companies in Flanders involved in the plastic recycling value chain indicate that they perceive Chinas restrictions on the import of waste materials introduced in is generally seen in a positive light as it creates potential opportunities for more activities and invest ments in Europe and Flanders OVAM however recognised that Chinas decision resulted in a temporary oversupply of plastic waste on the Belgian market with a corresponding price reduction It warned that Belgian recy clers could face difficulties with respect to marketing their recycled prod ucts since there is currently only a limited amount of applications for recycled plastic As such OVAM considered the option of regulations to promote the use of recycled plastic or government subsidies to overcome the uncertainties which can limit possible investments OVAM France Germany The Netherlands Europe other Outside Europe BelgiumFig Recycling of packaging location Fost Plus W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM Despite the dedicated programmes municipal waste management in Belgium shows a low overall recycling rate for Brussels EEA Also more recent data sets Eurostat show a recycling rate of for Brussels while the average Belgian performance was in In EEA the low performance is explained by the lack of infrastructure for the treatment of organic waste and lack of collectionrecycling infrastruc ture related to the high urban density Zeller et al Apart from its objectives on waste prevention and recycling Flanders wants to maintain its comparatively strong performance by reducing household consump tion even further When compared with other EU countries Belgium per forms very well in reducing per capita waste at the household This is a challenging area that requires continual awareness campaigns and a focus on changing behaviour While household waste in the EU grew at an aver age of per annum over the period Belgium reduced its household consumption by OVAM recognises the limitations of separated collection recycling and treatment of waste The current view of OVAM is that it is better to prevent waste generation and to reuse goods Through the new implementation plan OVAM in combination with municipalities will attempt to decouple consumption from waste gen eration This is important as the Flanders region produced an average of around kg of household waste per capita in and well above the Belgian and EU averages The current aim in Flanders is to reduce per capita waste to less than kg by OVAM Table challenges and opportun ItIes The aim of this case study has been to draw attention to some of the chal lenges faced by governments in a multilevel system from developing and implementing consistent waste management policies that contribute to the transition from a linear to a circular economy Belgian regional gov ernments have largely been effective in establishing coordinated waste management policies that reflect many of the circular principles They have been comparatively successful in recycling waste as they have been willing to apply a suite of policy instruments that include compulsory requirements and financial incentives to encourage behaviour change Legislated stewardship requirements for packaging producers have also contributed to high levels of recycling both household waste and business S M JONES Table

of independence WASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM waste In addition the Belgian experience shows that it is very important that such instruments be supported by a system of levies The case study has focused particularly on the experience of the Flanders region as it appears to have taken waste policy action as a political priority over time For Flanders the waste management policy encompasses tar gets for environmental improvement economic growth and social devel opment all of which are in harmony with circular principles The government of Flanders also wants to uncouple the production of waste from increasing consumption Since Flanders through OVAM has continued to set ambitious per capita waste reduction targets This objec tive remains unchanged even in the context of social and economic changes that are seeing increasing numbers of smaller households increasing con sumption and the reduction of the average life cycle of products and it increases the production of waste materials OVAM b Each of the Belgian regional governments focused on recycling with strong application of separation provisions required of households and business The application of PAYT to waste has been a common element of waste policy to support recycling in the three regions Research shows that the implementation of PAYT schemes along with the development of appropriate infrastructure and awareness raising helps to achieve some of the demanding objectives of the circular economy Morlok et al In Flanders results have shown that while implementing a landfill ban on its own can be effective it needs to be used in conjunction with an incineration ban so that the fundamental aspects of the waste hierarchy are supported The more materials that remain in the material cycle the more likely it is that waste policy can make a contribution to the circular econ omy Research also shows that PAYT schemes do not necessarily have an effect on the longterm total amount of waste generated and managed by a country Morlok et al To date Flanders appears to have recog nised this by taking steps in recent years to support higher levels of reuse of materials The experience of other countries is that more effective approaches require other policies developed at the national or the regional level for example product policies waste prevention plans and tax regula tions and more targeted actions at the local level such as awareness raising campaigns r euse initiatives secondhand markets and repair cafes ibid The experience of the Belgian regions highlights some weak spots pre venting a more comprehensive transition from a linear to a circular econ omy in a multilevel system Belgian waste management agencies have S M JONES demonstrated effective collection methods but they are yet to develop systems that process recycled material to the same levels of competence Exporting recycled material to other European countries for processing remains the main practice There are also some inconsistent approaches by each region in different aspects that show the challenge of taking policy action to preventing the growth of waste through reducing consumption Action in this area is a cornerstone of the circular economy as it prevents the use of raw materials entering the waste cycle however there appears to be a lack of commitment by governments to challenge consumption as a policy priority A circular economy necessitates redesigning material life cycles to reduce the volume of materials used This is a difficult area for government action There is a tension between promoting economic growth and taking the seemingly counterintuitive action to change behaviour and lower levels of consumption Decades of learned consump tion based on linear approaches will require policy priority to establish longterm effective policy measures previously off limits to governments in marketbased economies Belgium has the highest net financial wealth by households in the EU Minne et al During the global financial crisis from to Belgian private consumption still recorded an average annual growth rate of about well above the average pace that was observed in the three main neighbouring countries Research suggests that as a country becomes richer the composition of its waste changes With more money comes more packaging imports electronic waste and broken toys and appliances Hoornweg et al The Waste Framework Directive EU obliges EU member states to adopt and implement waste prevention pro grammes The revised Waste Framework Directive EU strengthens this requirement but does not introduce binding quantified targets for waste prevention A review of available programmes indicates that coun tries use a broad range of measures with a focus on informationbased instruments and to a lesser extent regulatory and economic instruments Common elements of government policy action include taking an overt focus on endofpipe actions lower R options with no specific mea sures for reducing the overarching material use Milios The armslength agencies in Belgium such as those focused on waste policy tend to have high levels of policy autonomy visvis the minister political oversight Verschuere These agencies have been estab lished to help promote coordination and cooperation between regional approaches The agencies declare that they are able to choose their W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN BELGIUM preferred target groups and policy instruments In the case of OVAM it can develop and implement legislation focused on waste management for the Flanders region The IVCCIE has responsibility to formulate propos als and advice for the regional governments on amending the joint agree ment IVCCIE b The experience of the IVCCIE reveals that cooperation is not impossible if regional governments are committed to a joint approach This has often proven to be challenging in the Belgian federation where the central government does not have the constitutional responsibility to take the lead in bringing the regional governments together to a common integrated approach While recycling of plastic packaging has achieved a common approach challenges remain in other critical areas of waste As an example the Flanders Environment Agency Report reveals the current linear approaches to food production and industry resistance to drastic change In spite of the pressure exerted on the system by sustainability issues soci etal developments and emerging niches there appears to be no real sense of urgency for structural changes The regime of conventional agriculture food industry and retail focus primarily on the preservation of existing organisations structures and institutions and on transformation based on technologically supported ecological modernisation Again the experi ence of Flanders is leading the way on this In Flanders of all food waste is reused within the food system is used as animal feed as materialgenerally as soil improver or fertiliser with or without prior composting or fermentationand is used for energy applications Only is incinerated with energy recovery and about is landfilled or dis charged Flanders Environment Agency Research has indicated that agencies in Belgium tend to be more inno vative and customer oriented than their administrative counterparts espe cially if there is sufficient autonomy and result control Verhoest et al Research by CampbellJohnston et al suggests that multi level policy integration is needed to alter value chains to enable greater reduction in material inputs and changes in actor behaviour towards a transitions to a circular economy Whether Belgian waste management agencies can take coordinated policy action on the more challenging cir cular aspects such as reducing consumption without pushback from political and business interests remains to be seen S M JONES references Belgium Ensemble faisons tourner lconomie en dveloppant lconomie circulaire en Belgique Lets make the economy work by

exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG S M Jones Advancing a Circular Economy  Waste Management in Norway Abstract This chapter adopts the political priority framework as a tool for analysing the policy ef fort undertaken in Norway to establish a circular economy Of particular relevance is the implementation of sustainable approaches to waste management The contribution of the multilevel nature of the Norwegian political system is highlighted in discussing approaches to policy development and implementation Challenges and opportunities for the adoption of further aspects of the circular model beyond recycling are also discussed Keywords Norway Recycling Municipalities Competitiveness Circular economy Introduct Ion Waste management in Norway is characterised by complexities and chal lenges that reveal a need for according these issues a higher policy priority support towards more sustainable approaches There has been a focus on exporting recycled material rather than the development of a local recy cling industry capable of accommodating the volumes of waste produced Milton Rising volumes of hazardous waste are derived from con sumer goods such as computers and mobile phones NEA Reports by Statistics Norway show that waste volumes have continued to increase since While waste from manufacturing has slowly decreased waste from households has shown no sign of reducing SSB a b The Norwegian Environment Agency sees affluence as a prime driver of increasing volumes of household waste NEA Studies reveal that waste prevention at the household level has a long history of failure in the Norwegian context Hildebrand Despite government commitments and statements of support to EU circular initiatives Norway has no clear policy or strategy on establishing more sustainable approaches nor a single responsible ministry The various aspects of circular economy are addressed as appropriate by several ministries under their individual areas of responsibility EEA a A lack of strong legislative support at the national level for industry compliance and uncoordinated governance arrangements at the ministerial level combined with inconsistent approaches at the municipal level continue to provide challenges in this key area of supporting sustainability focused policy initiatives in the man agement of waste The b White Paper Waste as resourceWaste policy and circular economy outlines the Norwegian governments proposals to meet EU Waste Framework Directive including requirements under the EU Circular Economy Package EEA The primary purpose of the White Paper was to contribute to the establishment of a government strategy that would promote resource efficiency as the core of a circular economy The focus is on initiatives for the reduction of food loss support for recycling and a strategy for plastics with a priority on microplastics and marine littering There is also a requirement for implementing the European Commissions waste regulations particularly more ambitious targets for recycling municipal waste Questions have been raised regard ing the level of commitment the Norwegian government has to achieving many of the wasterelated targets and whether there is any serious inten tion to establish a circular economy The White Paper has been criticised for not developing specific indicators or other measurement tools for determining progress towards circular approaches In this regard the International Solid Waste Association claims that the Norwegian approach leaves a lot to be desired ISWA While there have been strong results in Norways recycling of plastic bottles and cans there have been ongoing challenges in reducing consumption to prevent the continuing growth in volumes of waste S M JONES Waste Manage Ment In norWay Policy Context Norway is a constitutional monarchy with legislative power vested in its unicameral parliament Stortinget The Parliaments members are directly elected by a system of proportional representation for fouryear terms It is led by a presidium consisting of a president and five vice presi dents In the parliament of Norway consisted of minor parties rang ing from conservative centre rightleft green and Christian Democrats Since the Right Party the Progressive Party the Left party and the Christian Peoples Party have reached an agreement to establish a majority government At the committee level there are opportunities for political parties to participate in the decisions that help determine government policy The Standing Committee for Energy and the Environment has an interest in the circular economy and waste management it has mem bers with representation from each of eight political parties Stortinget There is general agreement in the Stortinget The governments political cooperation platform says that Norway should be a pioneer in developing a green circular economy that makes better use of resources and that a national strategy on circular economy should be prepared Norway b Although not a member of the EU Norwegian approaches to waste comply with the EU Waste Framework Directive As a member of the European Economic Area EEA Agreement Norway is also a member of the European Free Trade Association EFTA and needs to conform with the EU policies on waste management if it is to continue to benefit from EU subsidies and trade As a result Norwegian environmental policy has been strongly influenced by the EU Norway has also often influenced EU environmental policy and in some areas has adopted requirements more stringent than those of the EU Norway has shared values and high degree of integration with EU environmental initiatives It is in Norways eco nomic interest in promoting European competitiveness and high standards for the protection of the environment As a highlevel influence substantial aspects of the legislation proposed in the European Commissions European Green Deal to promote wastefocused initiatives associated with a circular economy will fall within the scope of the EEA Norway is very active in the W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY bureaucracy of the EU and sees itself making a contribution to the develop ment of these initiatives Norway a In terms of institutional settings the Norwegian government develops national waste policy establishing the general framework for stakeholders with adherence to EU commitments Municipalities and industry share responsibility for local waste collection and treatment solutions Important waste policy instruments include legislation taxes and economic incen tives targeted at the municipalities business and industry There is consid erable variation in approaches to waste management between municipalities based on population resources and local conditions Municipalities are sovereign legal entities and national policy initiatives are proposed more as expectations than regulated requirements The Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities states that municipalities have connec tions with the EU that require both legal and political connections KS The EEA is one area where municipal governments see opportuni ties to influence EU affairs Compliance with national objectives is moni tored by national environmental authorities and county governors the process entails problem identification and resolution along with follow up super vision through relevant ministries Similar to other areas of envi ronment policy in Norway waste regulation resides with the Ministry of the Climate and the Environment however the laws that mandate actual measures are enforced by a number of other authorities subsumed under several ministries Hanssen et al This feature of policy implemen tation can contribute to challenges for coordination and the measurement of results Complicating the scenario is the fact that intermunicipal com panies represent the most common approach to collection and processing of waste with the majority of municipalities cooperating to organise their waste services The largest industry group is Avfall Norge a trade associa tion for waste management and recycling companies in Norway Avfall Norge membership includes municipal and intermunicipal solid waste organisations and covers about of Norways municipalities Avfall Norge a Approximately municipalities run waste services inhouse some support competitive tendering resulting in outof municipality pr ovision either by public companies from other municipali ties or private companies Torsteinsen and Genugten Waste management is one of the municipal services with the highest degree of variation in organisational forms both public and private delivering Norwegian public services The Norwegian government relies on a variety of policy measures to provide incentives for waste prevention including relying on extended S M JONES producer responsibility EPR arrangements for business and encouraging changes to consumer behaviour Waste prevention activities tend to focus on selected types of waste including food waste waste from building and construction electric and electronic waste and textiles Measures for waste prevention are assessed on where prevention will have the greatest environmental effects throughout the life cycle of each product and where there will be the largest potential for economic benefit of the measures Papineschi et al The first unified Norwegian legislation concerning pollution and waste was the Pollution Control Act of Waste treatments have traditionally involved recycling and incineration for example in Norway intro duced a recovery target for of municipal waste In landfill and incineration taxes were introduced By the tax was abolished as administrative costs were greater than the revenue generated In a landfill ban for biodegradable waste was introduced for paper tree and food waste The incineration tax was terminated in largely due to the fact that Sweden had already abolished its incineration taxcreating a market in which Norwegian incineration plants were uncompetitive As a result almost all of the municipal solid waste MSW and waste in gen eral exported from Norway goes to Sweden and almost exclusively to incinerate in wastetoenergy WtE plants for district heating Detailed statistics are difficult to obtain but it is estimated that million tonnes of MSW are exported every five years The topic is complex and lower processing costs in Sweden which has a WtE overcapacity are considered the main reason for the MSW exports NEA b In an ironic twist Norway has recently been importing around tonnes waste per year for the emerging Norwegian WtE plants in particular mainly refuse derived fuel RDF fr om the UK NEA b The Norwegian government recognises a need for a greater focus on waste prevention especially for food waste construction and industrial waste electrical products and textiles Scholars argue that Norwegian gov ernment initiatives are relatively weak as they aim to a small degree at directly preventing waste Malinauskaite et al The Nordic Council of Ministers has argued that Norway needs to identify and develop cost effective prevention solutionsnot least to meet the targets of the EU Directives on waste Papineschi et al In its most recent report the NEA states From to waste rose by while GDP increased by as a result the national target for waste prevention was not achieved NEA a W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY Ideas and Appr oaches Taken In an attempt to focus waste policies in the direction of circular initiatives the Norwegian government released the Strategy for Green Competitiveness in Strategy NMCE a This strategy contains basic ideas and principles emerging from the White Paper that forms the basis of its core aspects including the circular economy as one contribution to green competitiveness The strategy is a key milestone for the Norwegian gov ernment and for the waste and recycling industry because it regards the sector as a catalyst for moving towards a circular economy The govern ment claims it will promote a transition to sustainable practices through a set of four wasterelated initiatives Seek to str engthen markets for secondary raw material Further develop environmentally sound use of waste Increase recycling rates Strengthen demand for circular economy solutions through coop eration with the EU labelling schemes to encourage green con sumption NMCE a The minister for climate and environment has suggested that Norway recognises the importance of waste policy as it can reflect many circular principles waste is no longer first and foremost a problemit is also a resource Almost everything we consider as waste can be reused or recov ered Recycling and measures to reduce waste are important elements in our waste policies NMCE a The Norwegian government relies on regulatory measures established under the Pollution Control Act and assorted Waste Regulations as the means of achieving its waste management goals Papineschi et al A key objective of the strategy is to promote access to and production of highquality secondary raw materials using financial incentives to encour age business uptake The government is proposing a requirement that business should draw up clear criteria for secondary raw materials and communicate them to manufacturers For its part the government will take steps to strengthen the market for secondary raw materials in coop eration with the manufacturing and waste management sectors These ideas reflect the proposals made in the White Paper and the Strategy that reflect the Norwegian governments tendency to avoid setting specific S M JONES targets for broadscale recycling and separation of waste and take serious steps to increase useful and environmentally sound use of waste and waste based pr oducts Norway There is some recognition within government that the EU Green Deal initiative could have important implications for Norwegian business and industry it has been framed pri marily as a waste management problem and an economic opportunity for Norwegian companies that can offer new smart green solutions and technology that will improve resource efficiency NMCE b As a result the strategy has raised attention to the necessity for companies to prepare to compete in the context of strict rules on resource efficiency NMCE b In Deloitte conducted a survey of Norwegian companies to illustrate circular initiatives being taken The key finding was that few companies are undertaking comprehensive circular efforts Companies that have some interest in circular approaches deal primarily in consumer goods and related services linked closely to their EPR obliga tions usually related to endoflifecycle returns and customer engage ment usually related to educating the consumer in how they can reduce their own waste Deloitte The objective of the survey was to motivate conversations between government and business that can work as a starting point for developing a green economy ibid As part of the preparation of the strategy the Standing Committee on Energy and Environment invited specific industries to develop roadmaps to promote more circular practices and reflect the idiosyncrasies of their business base Part of the roadmap proposals have been the industry per spective on the most appropriate government response to their needs This interaction between the committee and external groups reflects a longstanding practice of Norwegian governments observed in other areas of environment policy Bailey observed this characteristic in research on Norways policy action on commercial whaling Environmental and other civil society organizations are drawn into the cor poratist channels where power has been traditionally centered Civil society organizations participate in the system of committees where policy forma tion occurs and play a role in policy implementation This system which incorporates civil society actors into governance and negotiates outcomes generally reduces the need for NGOs to play an external watchdog role to rely on broad public campaigns to push for legislative change and to turn to litigation to enforce environmental laws and regulations Bailey W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY The result of this approach has been a close relationship between indus try and government in terms of framing environment policy arguments in favour of business interests Dryzek et al observed this close rela tionship between these groups and the state in Norway in a system that values consensus Avfall Norge developed the most significant roadmap in the context of Norways ambitions to move to a circular economy given its focus on the management of waste While the roadmap reflects similar proposals for other European countries the authors see specific recom mendations for Norway To enhance reuserecycling a reduction of taxes on labor and an increase of taxes on the use of primary raw materials Wijkman and Skanberg as well as introducing endofwaste criteria for specific products that could contribute to increase the market for sec ondary materials The managing director of Avfall Norge made this observation We need the government to actively drive and encourage the circular econ omy It establishes standards acts as a facilitator and driver of change and ensures a level playing field on the market The roadmap recommended that the Government creates a clear national strategy for resource efficiency which includes goals for waste minimization reuse and material recovery as well as a distinct framework for the economic actors The strategy must of course be rooted in the EUs Circular Economy Package ISWA Other roadmaps encourage the government to take stronger legislative action than has hitherto been the case for example the Norwegian Federation of Industries argues that a feature of a low carbon economy is higher demand for products with small carbon footprints from both pro duction and use Norwegian process industries are and will continue to be capable of supplying this demand with new increasingly clean and innovative products and processes Achieving this requires predictable framework conditions and continued access to renewable energy at com petitive terms FNI A summary of the ideas from different Norwegian industry roadmaps is outlined in Table A longterm preference by the Norwegian government has been to establish voluntary agreements between government and industry In this regard the government frames the solution to waste issues as the responsi bility of both industry and households The government approach is to set boundaries and expectations and require industry participants to achieve S M JONES specific targets within agreed timeframes Waste treatment is regulated and influenced by policies and measures between different ministries The Ministry of Environment the Ministry of Oil and Energy and the Ministry of Finance are jointly responsible for environmental taxes on different energy resources and carriers and tax policies in general Bauer and FischerBogason Research shows that the mix of voluntary agree ments with other financial instruments can result in a situation of eco nomic funding and taxes that fail to give the right incentives to actors in the market to manage waste in the most sustainable way Raadal et al The processing of food waste in Norway is an example of a voluntary sectoral agreement The Industry agreement on the reduction of food waste involved a crosssection of policy actors in the management of waste These included various government agencies including the Ministry for Climate and Environment Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Trade Industry and Fisheries Industry groups were also critical actors as they could volunteer to be part of the Agreement including groups like the Groceries Sectors Environmental Forum the National Federation of Service Industries the Norwegian Fishermens Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union have committed to partici pate Norway The Agreement is an example of the Norwegian Table Norway industry roadmap response Nordic Council of Ministers NCM Organisation Policy instrument The Federation of Norwegian IndustriesIncrease recycling rates for building and construction Adopt strict recycling goals in legislation Legislated waste plan for all buildings The Federation of Norwegian Construction IndustriesLegislated recycled content in new products Regulated documentation requirements for materials used in new constructions The trade organisation Bygg uten GrenserLegislate traceability of building materialproducts Environmental labelling for all building materials Increase knowledge of circular economy by focusing on industrial symbiosis Norwegian Association of Heavy Equipment ContractorsBuilding regulations to require development of waste plans and environmental management Regulation of documentation of all materials used in new constructions W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY approach that attempts to share responsibilities between consumers and producers Industry organisations have signed the agreement to halve food waste throughout the food value chain by The agreement is a followup measure in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal It is more ambitious because the goal applies to the entire food value chain from primary production to consumers The agreement may be voluntary but it is binding for the contracting parties EEA These schemes however have been criticised for creating opportunities for free riders as there is no compulsion for food manufacturers to participate in the Agreement only to comply if they commit to it Other weaknesses include a lack of monitoring and performance assessments lack of trans parency on their cost effectiveness failure of these schemes to promote improved sustainable product design and distortions of international trade markets that may disadvantage local firms participating in EPR schemes Zero Waste Europe The agreement on food waste reflects similar agreements in Norway that adopt EPR principles These include voluntary schemes on waste electrical and electronic equipment WEEE batteries tyres endoflife vehicles ELVs packaging waste and beverage packaging The purpose of Norways EPR provisions is to facilitate takeback sys tems to incentivise households in a way that promotes high recycling recovery rates The Norwegian Waste Regulations implemented in contained chapters regarding the treatment of different waste streams and requirements for recycling There are requirements for the reception col lection recycling and other treatment of electrical and electronic waste Distributors of these products are required to receive household WEEE free of charge from shops or other collection points Municipalities are also required to ensure that there are sufficient reception facilities for these products and accept this waste free of charge Producer responsibility is maintained by requiring participating producers to fund the collection sorting and treatment of WEEE through membership of a collectively or individually funded return company The regulation sets out recycling targets which must be met by the return companies Similar to the WEE scheme distributors of batteries are required to accept returned batteries free of charge from shops or similar facilities Norway is also investigating possible EPR schemes and financial mechanisms for new takeback systems on leisure boats and equipment from the fishing and fishfarming indus tries EEA The most successful and widely known Norwegian EPR arrangement is the recycling of approximately of plastic bottles since by using S M JONES a nationwide bottle deposit scheme The scheme is again based on key policy actors in both government and the private sector The state secre tary for the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment points out that while the container scheme is successful and even a good model for other countries government should actually take a handsoff position There should not be any bureaucracy involved Its been proven to work and its a good idea in accordance with the plastic discussion Milton Whether or not this position is the result of industry lobbying is difficult to assess The scheme involves the application of an environmen tal tax that bottle producers must pay unless they take responsibility for recycling over of plastic bottles Taylor The scheme is seen to demonstrate the responsiveness of business to such incentives and the will ingness of the Norwegian households to participate and benefit financially in reverse vending arrangements if they are easily accessible Jrgensen argues that the Norwegian bottle deposit scheme highlights three key insights into factors that influence consumer recycling conditions First there is a financial incentive to return the plas tic containers second the return system is clearly defined and convenient and third responsibility for the scheme rests with the industrial actors that produce and use the plastic containers In the context of the arguments in this book a fourth insight is also clear which is that governments with responsibility for the relevant policy instruments in this case the environ mental tax make its introduction a policy priority The policy actions of the Norwegian government applying the polluterpays principle to pack aging delegated the environmental and economic responsibility of recy cling and reusing packaging to business ibid The Norwegian state secretary for the Ministry for Climate and Environment stated in A lot of our plastic waste is exported to Sweden and Germany because they have a better recycling industry they have a better system than Norway Milton How to raise the policy priority for strengthening recy cling capacity will become increasingly important for Norway as the circu lar targets of the EU Parliament continue to place pressure on signatories of the EEA to improve waste management policies and practices Policy Actors The Norwegian Public Report NOU requires each ministry to invite experts and central stakeholders to make a statement on current knowl edge in a policy area Norway a Through this process key actors W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY relevant to policy debates have opportunities for input at the Green Paper stage Policy actors are instructed to arrange different forms of seminars and input The NOU is sent on public hearing so anyone can have an opinion In drafting a White Paper each ministry explains their positions and general policy approaches This is a closed process and there are bureaucratic and political negotiations between sectors it is the bureau cracys statement of position with a political backing Stortinget is the pro cess of receiving the White Paper to make decisions within committeeand decisions are open in the form that specific issues should be dealt with but not as a statement of new regulation or budget Rather the ministry will later have to defend whether the decisions are taken into account and explain how The Stortingets Proposal is a public document but a different form of White Paper explicitly suggesting and arguing for a new regula tion or budget allocation The Proposal might be subject to public hear ing particularly if regulatory change is involved and in either case is subject to internal hearing within the ministries The ministries will usually involve stakeholders but this is an obscure process and depends on exist ing networks and forums and trust relations The Stortinget passes law and this law proposal will be subject of a public hearing The traditional Norwegian approach is reflected in the recent policy debate in the management of hazardous waste Evidence suggests that there are multiple issues relating to hazardous waste including the identi fication of new landfill sites and the need to reduce the volumes of hazard ous material being illegally dumped The waste industry has been critical of the governments delay on determining new landfill sites to replace the Langoya site which is reaching capacity Avfall Norge d The minis ter for climate and environment appointed an expert committee to exam ine the issues in The committee considered how to reduce hazardous waste and possible solutions to challenges of landfill The committee is a good example of the key policy actors in waste management in Norway consisting of five representatives from the waste industry one from munic ipal government one from the Department of Environment and one aca demic from the Faculty of Economics NTNU Interestingly the committee did not have representation from the construction industry the main source of hazardous waste or the incineration industryone of the main alternatives to landfill The committee report argued that the government needed to establish clear targets for recycling and resource utilization be taken into account by the authorities when making decisions related to hazardous waste Norway a The committee took the S M JONES opportunity to argue that a circular economy involved more than a focus on waste The government had been slow to act on promoting a circular economy and needed to act quickly in establishing measures to support research innovation and commercialisation ibid In response to ques tions in the Stortinget in the minister for climate and environment admitted that there had been no followup to the committees report The minister confirmed that the ministry was undertaking its own assessments including dialogue with key industry players about possible solutions There was no conclusion on the future treatment capacity for hazardous waste or the establishment of new landfill sites Avfall Norge The Strategy for Green Competitiveness a was drafted in a col laboration between the ministries of climate and environment finance trade and industry and petroleum and energy A key finding of the Strategy committee was that there needs to be improvements in cooperation between authorities including municipal governments researchers and the business sector EPRbased requirements involve policy actors directly involved in the production disposal and recycling of waste These actors have been outlined in the relevant sections throughout this case study Government arguments on this suggest they believe that these actors have better insight into the opportunities and challenges facing specific indus tries As a result the government has been strengthening cooperation in the process industry sector between business and industry partners the public administration and researchers and has established a longterm strategic forum called Prosess Norway Early initiatives suggest that this new approach includes stakeholders from the industrial and research sectors Innovation Norway the Research Council and the Norwegian Environment Agency There are no guarantees however that this approach will lead to policy change in waste management practices SteinerKhamsi et al have analysed the Norwegian policy process and the links between expert advice and evidence and the committee stage Green Papers and the political policy stage White Papers They con clude that in Norway around percent of texts amassed by expert com missions in order to provide evidencebased policy advice to the government is ignored p In contrast to consultation Norwegian ministries tend to focus on their own evidence over other expert sources It is certainly difficult to ascertain any clarity on this matter through the procedures of the Stortinget where there is little information on debates either in the Committees or in the Parliament There is no public access to submissions that may have been made by industry representatives to the W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY debates on the discussion about the circular economy or waste manage ment as outlined in the strategy According to surveys among Norways MPs the nature of political rep resentation in the Norwegian Parliament means that lobby groups as policy actors push their agenda through individual MPs Rommetvedt argued that of the MPs agree that interest group lobbying furnishes them with alternative information and counter expertise and therefore improves their ability to control the executives followup of the resolutions and intentions of the Stortinget The politically fragmented nature of political representation through a broad range of political parties in the Norwegian parliament would suggest many opportunities for pres sure through lobbying One example where lobbying has proven to be successful has been the efforts by WWF over what it claims were many years for Norway to ban disposable plastic products In the WWF claimed its efforts had been somewhat vindicated when the minister for climate and environment announced a Norwegian ban that would intro duce producer responsibility for these products in The WWF argued that it was disappointing that the government bill did not include a clear regulatory liability scheme for all plastic manufacturers WWF Whether the Norwegian approach produces the most effective policy for the overall management of waste and the achievement of stated goals remains to be seen challenges and opportun ItIes Quantities of W aste Continue to Rise Despite setting a policy objective of decoupling waste from economic growth government figures show that waste continues to increase at a higher rate than GDP SSB The Norwegian Environment Agency argues that between and the growth in waste rates were lower than economic growth but after waste volumes increased more than GDP primarily due to an increase in household waste NEA a The largest source of waste in Norway has been the construction industry but much of this waste stream is recovered Waste generation by industrial activities has declined in the past ten years Registered exports of waste from Norway continue to increase with much of this waste exported to Sweden for wastetoenergy WtE purposes Eurostat b The state secretary for the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment argues S M JONES that despite the reliance on other countries taking the plastic collected in Norway there could be changes in the future He mentions companies in Norway taking an interest Several new companies are now building dif ferent factories different plants around the country and they can recycle the plastic into bioethanol which is biofuel So there is a growing industry in Norway Milton This approach reflects the corporatised nature of Norwegian politics that industry should drive innovation in this area rather than the government Such approaches will continue to benefit the interests of business and industry Current analysis by Statistics Norway shows the following the total amount of waste generated in Norway was million tonnes in of all waste was recovered in there was rise in total waste quantities from to SSB a b In each Norwegian on average produced kg waste SSB b while the average figure for the EU countries was kg Eurostat a Fig Waste amounts tend to fluctuate above and below GDP but the trend is one that continues to rise The trend for material recycling tends to go down This is mainly due to growth in waste from the construction indus try as the main source of an increasing amount of waste that is landfilled Fig Fig Total waste is still going up Source SSB W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY Hazardous W aste Hazardous waste contains substances that are hazardous to health and the environment and in order to ensure that people and the environment are not damaged by the hazardous waste it is important that it is delivered for proper treatment The export of hazardous waste from Norway increased from thousand tonnes in to thousand tonnes in Only France with thousand tonnes has a higher rate than Norway see Fig These are the only recorded figures provided by Norway in a context where EU countries report annually To compare this figure Belgiums with double Norways population export of hazardous waste in was thousand tonnes and thousand tonnes in Eurostat b Reasons for the export increase include an insufficient combustion capacity in Norway and a ban on the landfilling of biodegrad able waste coupled with changes in economic and market factors Malinauskaite et al A lack of recycling facilities across Norway contributes to the need for increasing volumes of waste being exported for disposal through incineration on other countries In the recovery of nonhazardous waste undergoing known treatment was a decrease of from this corresponds to million tonnes In of nonhazardous waste undergoing known Fig Waste in Norway by source Source SSB S M JONES treatment was energy recovered while was subject to material recov ery The main reason for the decrease in recovery is less waste used as fill ing compounds and cover materials in compared to the years before The hazardous waste statistics show that in

Table shows Norways performance in the circular econ omy measures applied to different aspects of waste over the period Two other circular economy measures developed by the EU include the trade in recyclable materials across EU borders including plastic paper and precious metals Figures cover the period Another measure focuses on the circular material use rate with a focus on material recovered and fed back into the economy over the period As a reflection of Norways delay in establishing a circular strategy the gov ernment has been unable to provide data to the EU on these measures Eurostat Table EU circular economy measures Norway Eurostat Measure EU Recycling of municipal waste Recycling of all waste excluding major mineral wasteNA NA Recycling of packaging waste Recycling of ewaste Recycling of biowaste Recovery rate of construction and demolition waste W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY The statistics on waste from households in Table shows that Norway has not been able to fulfil the requirement for material recycling in a per capita basis in previous years In the proportion of household waste delivered for recycling was up to Since then the share has dropped and has remained at just under since A key issue for recycling is the inconsistency of approaches taken by Norwegian municipalities Larger municipal governments have access to resources and in some cases the political will to support a stronger focus on recycling One of the most successful has been the Oslo Kommune which won the European Green Capital Award in for its approach to environmental issues including waste management The city has been recognised for its approach to environmental issues set ambitious climate change goals including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by by and achieving climate neutrality by The management of waste in the city makes a major contribution to these goals Oslo In terms of recycling the city has invested in sorting technology in addition to source separation at the household Oslo is one of a few Norwegian cities to introduce source separation of food waste and plastic packaging to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve local air quality Source separation also helps improve recycling rates and the recovery of valuable resources found in waste products Karstensen et al The life cyclebased waste man agement system in Oslo involves waste sorting using fully automated opti cal sorting process for sourceseparated household waste separated into bags with specific colours The optical sorting plants are equipped with cameras that can identify the colours of the bags with about accuracy Table Household waste in Nor way SSB b Household waste Main figures In total Percentage change In total tonnes Per capita Sent to material

waste into three categories food is sorted in green bags plastic packaging in blue bags and residual waste in regular shopping bags This type of waste separation is in addition to exist ing systems for sorting paper and cardboard glass metal and hazardous waste A major advantage of this system is that the bags can all be placed into the same bin and transported in the same vehicle to the waste man agement plant Plastic waste in the blue bags is sent to treatment plants in Germany and Sweden where it is sorted into five to seven categories The plastic is melted into granules and then used as raw material in making new plastic products The Oslo Energy Recycling Agency collects house hold waste from the municipality produces district heating and makes biogas and biofertiliser The life cyclebased waste management system contributes to helping the city to achieve its ambitious climate goals for example material for recycling of Oslo In Norway the Ministry of Climate and the Environment oversees implementation of the nations waste management goals In many respects Norway can be regarded as a leader in the development and application of recycling and sorting technologies particularly for its plastic bottle deposit scheme Despite this success there are a number of challenges resulting from the institutional characteristics of the multilevel Norwegian context that need policy priority to overcome if future performance is to achieve the expectations set by the EU While the promotion of the circular econ omy in both the EU and Norway is focused on waste management there are specific areas that require stronger regulatory action if circular objec tives are to be advanced In some municipalities waste collection charges are at or close to cost recovery levels More differentiated charges according to weight or waste fractions could provide further incentives to increase recycling and waste reduction Extended producer responsibility regimes have been broad ened and their effectiveness has been enhanced by the introduction of taxes connected with depositrefund systems for endoflife products Further refinement of these policies could be supported by a clearer regu latory framework to overcome the weaknesses identified on the EPR schemes that create unfair competition in the marketplace and a lack of innovation in product design The waste industry argues that the govern ment could use its considerable purchasing power more effectively in pro moting demands on how much waste is to be recycled There are inconsistencies across government departments in their purchasing W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY regimes that fail to ensure that stronger requirements of suppliers and manufacturers meet EPR requirements Avfall Norge d Ensuring that new products placed on the market contain less hazardous substances will also be important In order to achieve this product standards or design requirements could be developed and applied through the govern ment procurement processes A policy priority for sustainability and inter est from the public all contribute to potential success in meeting stronger recycling targets Access to current and accurate data on waste management has been problematic in completing this case study The demand for good waste statistics is increasing in light of ambitious material recycling targets in the EU In the Stortinget announced that it would support strengthen ing the waste statistics To achieve ambitious material recycling goals requires good systems to measure progress It seems goodquality data has not been a priority area in Norway The EU plans to implement changes in how material recycling is measured from It is material recycling that will count where losses in various sorting and recycling processes will be deducted In addition rules are being developed for how to report preparation for reuse prepare for reuse Avfall Norge g Norwegian statistics indicate approximately material recycling both for house hold waste and waste from service industries In practice the amount actually used as raw material for new products is considerably lower which gives a poorer starting point in relation to new ambitious requirements Avfall Norge ibid has identified various practices in municipalities on how to report quantity to material recycling There has been obscurity and grey areas in terms of inclusions and exclusions of different types of waste and sources Problems include the following reporting forms are incom plete and somewhat inconsistent reporting guidelines are imprecise allowing for different interpretations and practices statistics reporting does not focus on the municipalities and finally statistics do not show a complete picture of the amount of household waste The result is that users of the statistics find it to be inaccurate and uncertain Comparative data between municipalities can give incorrect information about both specific waste quantities and the efficiency of sorting and recycling There are calls for Norways collection systems to avoid overreliance on sorting recyclables from mixed waste or comingled streams The con cern is that the quality of certain streams such as paper and cardboard is considerably higher when separated at source than when extracted from more mixed streams Additionally material losses from sorting S M JONES technologies are greater than those from separate collection and this becomes a particular issue when recycling targets rise As such whilst sort ing technologies will likely form a valuable part of Norways approach to meeting the increasing recycling targets they should be used in conjunc tion with approaches which prioritise separate collection and high capture rates of high quality of recycling as in the Oslo Kommune example In mixed residual waste accounted for of the total amount of household waste and represents the largest waste fraction Much of the residual waste goes to energy recovery where WtE facilities are available According to Avfall Norge c there are large amounts of food waste and plastic within the residual component that could have been sorted out and recycled Analyses of Norwegian municipalities show that up to half of all food waste is thrown in the residual waste instead of in the bag for food waste Waste industry calls for regulatory measures to ban the use of black plastic bags is one simple measure that could improve transparency and sorting quality Avfall Norge e The utilisation of waste resources through material recycling is central to EU waste targets and environmen tal legislation As an EEA member Norway is bound by the EU waste framework directive that requires material recycling of household waste and householdlike waste by These figures suggest that Norway will struggle to meet the EUs circular economy targets of recy cling municipal waste set at by by and by without stronger government commitment to establish targets and mea sures to support them Neligan Jrgensen argues that the history of Norwegian packaging recycling in the twentieth century demonstrates that recycling requires not only an awareness of waste generation but also a commitment to involving waste management in everyday practices The Norwegian situation also reflects waste management challenges in other multilevel systems The government has a responsibility to monitor and respond to trends in changing attitudes to waste and recycling There has been acceptance of disposal fee schemes and refund deposit schemes Such schemes where implemented have resulted in improvements in rates of recycling Unfortunately there has not been the political will to make such schemes universal as implementation is largely a municipal responsibility Kipperberg There is a general reluctance at the national level to propose initia tives that can be interpreted as reducing municipal sovereignty The Nordic Council of Environment Ministers report on waste practices in Norway recognises that regional differences in recycling rates are notable W ASTE MANAGEMENT IN NORWAY As recycling collections are a municipal responsibility there is for the national government to promote greater consistency in approach to col lections improve consumer understanding and send a clearer message about desired recycling behaviour Such changes have the potential to ensure that all municipalities offer a service that is likely to support improved rates of recycling Papineschi et al A lack of clear regulation also impacts on the environmental crime in connection with the management of waste from the construction industry The main challenge is that the current regulations allow for cheating The challenge seems to be that there are no barriers in the regulations that ensure transparency in waste management for demolition waste There are grey areas in the building regulations and in the pollution regulations that lead to illegal mass handling Stronger regulatory interventions at the municipal level that allow for transparency and monitoring need to be introduced Construction waste and illegal dumping are areas of waste management that continue to increase and stakeholders have been lobby ing for government interventions Avfall Norge f Increased collec tions of hazardous waste and treatment of hazardous waste collected have contributed to reducing the environmental impact of Norways waste The Nordic Council of Ministers report shows that municipal waste generation in Norway is higher than Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD or EU averages although the reported household waste fraction corresponds to the OECD average Papineschi et al While there have been some important achieve ments in the recycling of certain elements of plastic waste and ewaste more needs to be done in other sources of waste if Norway continues to deal with the challenges of managing waste in the context of EU direc tives The political priority framework as applied in this chapter has helped to reveal some of the key factors and complexities that shape waste management policy in Norway Current government commitments and statements continue to support EU initiatives Despite these commit ments the Norwegian government is yet at the time of writing to produce the circular economy strategy as intended in the White Paper In a speech to the Norwegian Circular Economy Conference the minister for climate and environment gave an indication of the challenges being faced in developing the strategy In our work with the circular economy strategy ten ministries are cooperating in close connection with the industry Crossministerial cooperation can be challenging but it is the only way to go forwards NMCE The evidence covered in this S

Economy  Synthesis and Conclusions Unsustainable Status Quo Abstract This chapter pr esents a synthesis of the material covered in the previous chapters The waste crisis is highlighted as a significant policy issue facing governments The need for policy change to become a priority for policymakers is discussed The evidence presented in the case studies reveals the challenges faced in promoting and advancing a circular in mul tilevel political systems Ideas for governments considering circular approaches to waste management are also outlined Keywords Circular economy Policy change Multilevel systems political priority A W Aste MAnAgeMent Crisis How developed countries can transition to more economically and envi ronmentally sustainable approaches to waste management has become a key policy question for governments In its purest form sustainable approaches progressively eliminate waste by keeping resources in contin ual use The complex issues surrounding waste management policy reveal the nature and scope of the challenges facing governments attempting to implement sustainable approaches This book started with a question What happens to our waste The evidence presented throughout suggests that the answer is increasingly more to do with politics and competition between powerful interests than about sustainability practices and pre venting environmental damage The contemporary view of waste is that it is a valuable resource that needs new methods and approaches to extract the best value As we approach the target date for the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs in what happens to our waste over the next decade is a critical policy problem for government policymakers In the UN advocated taking a holistic approach towards waste management and recognising waste and resource management as a signifi cant contributor to achieving more sustainable development The UN acknowledged a need for addressing governance issues which help to establish sustainable solutionsincluding regulatory and other policy instruments the partnerships and the financing models UNEP Current debates about the crisis in waste management raise many issues requiring policy action The recycling failures revealed in the media high light policy issues that have potential to impact on citizen trust in political decisionmakers Citizens who comply with recycling requirements set by governments have expectations that environmental values will be met with a corresponding loss of trust if they are not Blaug et al Saphores et al Canadas prime minister referred to this in when he said To be honest as a dad its tough trying to explain this to my kids How do you explain dead whales washing up on beaches around the world their stomachs jampacked with plastic bags ABC The struggle to deliver solutions to crucial public challenges like waste management has contributed to a reduction of trust in governments in some Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries OECD Governments are increasingly seen to be placing interests of business over the demands of citizens This has been supported by recent surveys in Europe that show institutional trust levels of individuals and trustworthiness of government should be considered important factors for recycling behaviour Nilsson and Harring The waste crisis has created a sense of urgency towards identifying actions that governments can take to establish more sustainable approaches to manage waste Despite the introduction of waste management policies in many OECD countries that reflect sustainability principles evidence presented in Chap shows that while there are some improvements there continues to be a crisis that appears to be worsening Research sug gests waste generation is a key contributor to the problem with the growth in waste seemingly uncontrollable Ferronato and Torretta Minelgaite and Liobikiene As population in urban areas continues S M JONES to increase living standards improve and higher standards of living sup port greater levels of production and consumptionvolumes of waste continue to rise exponentially As a result of these trends current predic tions show that without urgent policy action global volumes of waste will increase by by World Bank The notion of a circular economy is of great interest to both researchers and practitioners as it is seen to reinvigorate enthusiasm in the concept of sustainability Proposals for circular approaches require a distinct shift away from longterm linear practices that include one of capitalisms driv ing principlesplanned obsolescence Responsibilities for business include designing better products that last longer manufacturing betterquality goods using fewer virgin raw materials and viewing waste as a resource With such changes it is argued that a circular economy can begin to develop To achieve these outcomes government policies can provide support to help make corporations more responsible in terms of their impact on natural resources and the environment generally Without some form of intervention to prioritise more sustainable practices current fore casts reveal a continuation of the unsustainable status quo Forcinio Hartley et al A C irCulAr response The reduction of waste and the promotion of recycling industries are criti cal to circular approaches in collecting waste materials and endoflife products and processing them for reuse as new products Government policy plays an important role in supporting the transition by industry and society and promoting widespread penetration of circular approaches The discourse of zerowaste and the circular economy has been championed by key policy actors such as the European Commission management consul tancies NGOs and multinational companies Valenzuela and Bhm The circular economy is primarily discussed through the R prin ciples of the waste hierarchy of reducing reusing and recycling Ranta et al Milios The OECD also takes a waste management based approach to a circular economy and emphasises resource efficiency and effectiveness as key values In the European Commission released Towards a circular econ omy A zero waste programme for Europe emphasising the link between a circular economy and waste management The EU claims that the eco nomic benefits of a circular economy will be numerous and significant SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO including enhancing the security of supply for raw materials stimulating GDP growth strengthening the competitiveness of businesses in the EU and helping to protect the environment European Parliament One area of particular interest has been the recycling of precious metals found in electronic goods The UN and the EU do not want to risk the future development of energy efficient technologies through a lack of access to critical metals UNEP The EU Directive on waste updates a EU Directive and establishes targets for waste pre vention reuse and recycling that reflect the EU ambition to move to a circular economy EU There has been mixed response by member states to the Directive so in the EU argued that it needed to set clear targets to improve performance Member states of the EU adopt an individual policy approach to achieve the targets set in the Directive The EU regulations are taken as a minimum standard and some countries have set higher targets Research by the European Environment Agency shows that out of EU coun tries have increased their recycling rates by since In some coun tries such as Estonia Malta and Serbia the very low proportion of recycled municipal waste barely changed EEA Results suggest that there are inconsistencies in the approaches taken across the EU because of fac tors unique to each jurisdiction that impact on the policy response and the results achieved For example some countries have banned incineration while others have been establishing incinerators as another end of pipe method of disposal Like landfill incineration is contrary to circular prin ciples as it removes material from the waste process that can no longer be recycled or reused The EU Directive of reinforces the commitment to waste management as the focus of policy action to shift the EU from a linear to a circular economy New targets reinforce the importance of recy cling over landfill the mandatory separation of biowaste and the applica tion of the polluter pays principle through extended producer responsibility In multilevel systems policymakers examining methods of advancing circular economy approaches operate within the constraints of their insti tutional arrangements where radical change may not be possible due to competing priorities between levels of government The focus on closing loops places circular economy at odds with many of the norms logics and routines of the linear economy which in many ways makes it counterin tuitive to established economic patterns for growth Longstanding modes of governing the waste systems have established social institutional and S M JONES financial arrangements benefiting policy actors and organisations based on linear arrangements Bulkeley et al Pollans Despite the challenges as outlined in Chap there is still enthusiasm for the concept of a circular economy as a framework for future sustainable economic development Policy priority needs to be strengthened to move beyond current approaches We need to examine what is required to achieve prior ity on the political agenda to help ensure that more substantial approaches are adopted There is a need for policy design for policy coherence and to broaden the scope of circular economy policy to reflect all pillars of circu lar economy and not just recycling For effective transition to circular economy to occur these matters need to achieve high political priority on the policy agenda of government to promote change politi CAl priority The policy change literature on environmental policy shows how govern ments have been reluctant to act particularly in the integration of new policy initiatives across jurisdictions in multilevel systems Ross and Dovers In many jurisdictions environment policy resides primarily with the subnational and local governments This is particularly true for waste management policy where municipal governments are generally responsi ble The framework of political priority proposed in Chap is derived from multiple policy change theories that reveal a range of dimensions and their determinants to potentially influence and shape political priority The core argument is that with increased political priority circular approaches to waste management will become a more central or salient policy com mitments The framework consists of four interrelated dimensions politi cal context the political and institutional environments in which actors operate the power of actors political strength of individuals and organ isations concerned with the issue the influence of ideas how political actors understand and frame the issue and problem characteristics the features of the problem being considered By utilising the determinants of political priority outlined in the frame work we have some understanding of the complexities that may emerge in according these issues a higher policy priority for a transition from the linear to the circular economy Political priority will be necessary for policy change to support acting on the key objectives beyond recycling and waste management Negotiating the idiosyncrasies of policymaking around cir cular issues in individual policy contexts will also play an important role in SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO determining policy change once political priority has been established In order to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities around these issues the experiences gleaned from the case studies in Chaps and of Belgium and Norway are informative for other multilevel systems consid ering progressing their circular economy agenda The achievement of the UN SDGs will require intergovernmental approaches with effective institutional coordination and coherence at all levels of policymaking This will contribute to ensuring more integrated policy frameworks for sustainable development promoting synergies between economic social and environmental policies identifying trade offs and considering transboundary and intergenerational impacts Without these critical elements developing and implementing circular economy objectives will be challenging In order to ensure that these aspects are incorporated into government policies political priority will be critical In the next section the experiences of Belgium and Norway will be outlined under each of the dimensions of the analytical framework reAlity CheCk W hAt the CAses reveAl Policy Context The policy context r eveals the constitutional and institutional arrange ments that determine responsibilities and authority for policies relevant for waste management Constitutional responsibility sets the context for poli cymaking it impacts on laws customs and established practices and organ isational settings that can be powerful in determining policy action This is particularly the case in multilevel systems where policy responsibility for specific issues can rest with one level of government Belgium is a federal state with quite autonomous regional governments which all move at a different pace towards sustainable development There are difficulties in implementing a common strategy on the national level as regional gov ernments have a high degree of selfrule and many contrasting interests stand in the way of a consensus In recent years Flanders has set up a strong institutional sustainable development framework including the framework for the development of a regional sustainable development strategy Bachus and Spillemaeckers The Belgian state is the legal entity responsible for compliance with EU legislative requirements for waste No federal authority has precedence over the regions exercise of environmental powers As in the European Waste Framework Directive S M JONES waste is defined by the three regional governments Wallonia Flanders and Brussels as any substance or object which the holder dis cards Municipal governments are responsible for implementation of regional waste policy priorities Belgian regions have implemented the European provisions relating to byproducts and end of waste status Belgiums initial response to a policy window created by public pressure over reducing landfill in the s was part of a European trend to sup port greater levels of sustainability particularly in the management of waste The work of OVAM and the Interregional Packaging Commission helps support institutional arrangements to promote policy coordination and cooperation between the regional governments that are important for facilitating policy change These institutional arrangements are decentral ised and allow for experimentation and mutual learning that are important advantages of multilevel systems The introduction of circular economy initiatives by the EU has been reflected by each of the Belgian governments The Belgian government introduced measures towards establishing a circular economy in Belgium Flanders introduced the Circular Flanders Together towards a circular economy Kickoff Statement OVAM b Wallonia introduced its Strategy for the deployment of circular economy in Wallonia Brussels City introduced the Brussels Capital region circular economy strategy in Brussels There has been a tendency to streamline waste legislation into one code in terms of inspec tion prevention determination and sanctioning of environmental issues For example the cooperative agreement between the three regions and the packaging sector was established in for recovering and recycling the packaging waste The current version is the Cooperation Agreement of on the prevention and management of packaging waste Belgium has established armslength government agencies with responsibility for waste policy with governance arrangements that support high levels of policy autonomy visvis the minister political oversight These agencies declare that they are able to choose their preferred target groups and pol icy instruments In the case of OVAM in Flanders it can develop and implement legislation focused on waste management for the Flanders region with a focus on establishing a circular economy Waste manage ment has been regarded as a reasonably uncontroversial policy area in the past and so requires little political oversight The intergovernmental IVC CIE has r esponsibility to formulate proposals and advice for the regional governments on amending a joint agreement on waste management SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO IVCCIE Research has indicated that Belgian agencies tend to be more innovative and customer oriented than their government counter parts especially if there is sufficient autonomy and result control Verhoest et al Research by Campbell Johnson et al suggests that multilevel policy integration is needed to alter value chains to enable greater reduction in material inputs and changes in actor behaviour towards a transition to a circular economy Whether Belgian waste man agement agencies can take policy action on the more challenging and perhaps controversial aspects of the circular economy such as reducing consumption without pushback from political and business interests remains to be seen In the Norwegian government produced a White Paper Waste as a resource waste policy and circular economy which outlines proposals on how Norway could potentially meet EU circular economy objectives By the government was yet to introduce a strategy aimed at establish ing a circular economy NMCE The national government has overall responsibility for regulating waste setting the general framework for stakeholders and leaving municipalities and industry responsible for local collection and treatment solutions By only the Oslo city gov ernment mentioned a circular economy in the context of its green city objectives that include waste management Oslo Kommune The National Waste Management and Prevention Plan From Waste to Resources was an attempt by the national government to establish a com prehensive coordinated waste management plan across each level of gov ernment In the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment set environmental targets including dealing with biodiversity climate change pollution outdoor recreation cultural heritage and the polar regions Important waste policy instruments include legislation taxes and economic incentives targeted at the municipalities business and industry As a result there is considerable variation between municipalities based on population resources and local conditions Waste regulation resides with the Ministry of the Climate and the Environment the laws that mandate actual measures are enforced by a number of other authorities subsumed under several ministries Hanssen et al Governance arrangements present a high level of complication that produce inconsistent approaches across the country Intermunicipal companies represent the most common approach to collection and processing with municipalities out of a total of municipalities cooperating to organise their waste services Some S M JONES municipalities support competitive tendering resulting in outofmunici pality provision either by public companies from other municipalities or by private companies Torsteinsen and Genugten Waste manage ment is one of the municipal services with the highest degree of variation in organisational forms both public and private delivering Norwegian public services The Norwegian government recognises a need for a greater focus on waste prevention especially for food waste construction and industrial waste electrical products and textiles Scholars argue that Norwegian government initiatives are relatively weak as they aim to a small degree at directly preventing waste Malinauskaite et al In an attempt to focus waste policies in the direction of circular initiatives the Norwegian government released the Strategy for Green Competitiveness in This strategy contains basic ideas and principles emerging from the White Paper that reflect EU circular economy objectives to form the basis of future Norwegian policies as well as a description of its core aspects including the circular economy as one contribution to the coun trys economic competitiveness rather than environmental sustainability Policy Actors This aspect of the framework utilises the Sabatiers Advocacy Coalition Framework to consider relevant actors attempts at influencing political priority for policy change These determinants focus on coalitions of government and nongovernment actors that engage in coordinated activity to promote the common cause they want to advance Advocacy coalitions can consist of elected and agency officials interest group lead ers and researchers who share a particular views and values that draw them together in an attempt to influence waste policy Leadership by policy entrepreneurs helps to unite a policy community through forming a link between formation and maintenance of advocacy coalitions Mintrom and Phillipa As policy actors entrepreneurs attempt to assemble and maintain coalitions to support specific policy ideas which prove to be valuable political resources during discussions of policy change Smith Political parties are an important feature of policy debate in parlia mentary systems as jurisdictions are influenced by agendas established by the major political parties Civil society mobilisation in the form of grass roots movements as policy actors often arises in reaction to perceived social injustices and environmental problems Smith and Seyfang Scholars such as Baker et al argue for the need to recognise SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO industry mobilisation as potential determinant of government acting to change specific policy An economic focus in policy change by govern ments works in favour of powerful industry stakeholders as advocacy coali tions who can mobilise to continue to support voluntary marketbased approaches as a reflection of economic ideas in structuring policy choices John In Belgium there is a high degree of cooperation between municipali ties as key policy actors at the regional level For example the VVSG is an association of all municipalities in Flanders As a key policy actor it repre sents their interests on sustainability issues with the regional government and negotiates on their behalf with government and with recognised bod ies of producers with producer responsibility obligations OVAM is the waste management agency that works as a policy entrepreneur as it also coordinates this cooperation working through Flemish municipalities and intermunicipal waste management organisations in negotiations with administration cabinet officials and industry OVAM has become a promi nent stakeholder on municipal solid waste management for the regional government and official departments In the past OVAM has made repre sentations to the EU on landfill mining issues including waste recovery opportunities OVAM OVAMs implementation plan for household waste raised the issue of reducing consumption but provided no clear ideas on how it could be done The Interregional Packaging Commission IVCCIE undertakes supervision and advisory roles to the regional waste authorities including OVAM The IVCCIE has contracted Fost Plus to coordinate with packaging manufacturers to collect and pro cess packaging from households and ValIPac has been contracted to pro cess industrial and commercial packaging waste Fost Plus has become a key policy actor representing industry with membership including major packaging firms such as Unilever Coca Cola Carrefour Total Proctor and Gamble and Danone Fost Plus Fost Plus has helped to mobil ise industry in promoting circular approaches and regularly makes repre sentations to governments on what industry requires in terms of policy change Recent issues have included resisting the introduction of a con tainer deposit scheme promoting waste sorting schemes in public spaces establishing awards for sustainable packaging and strategies to reduce free riding by packaging companies Fost Plus The government focus on recycling tends to work in favour of Fost Plus and its members as it encourages more consumption and programmes that support some of the highest rates of recycling in the EU In its Annual Report that S M JONES focuses on advancing to a circular economy Fost Plus make this ambition clear Our ambition for the years ahead is clear to collect more packaging waste to achieve higher recycling rates and to continue developing effi cient and sustainable systems Fost Plus According to surveys among Norwegian members of parliament the nature of political representation in Norway means that lobby groups as policy actors push their agenda through individual MPs Rommetvedt argued that of the MPs agree that interest group lobbying furnishes them with alternative information and counter expertise and therefore improves their ability to control the executives followup of the resolutions and intentions of the Stortinget Norway is a constitutional monarchy with legislative power being vested in its unicameral parlia ment In the parliament of Norway consists of minor parties rang ing from conservative centre rightleft green and Christian democrats Since the Right Party the Progressive Party and the Left and the Christian Peoples Party have reached an agreement to establish a majority government Such a diverse range of political actors will contribute to challenges in gaining political agreement to prioritise policy action At the committee level there are opportunities for political parties to participate in the decisions that help determine government policy The Standing Committee for Energy and the Environment has an interest in the circular economy and waste management it has members with representation from each of the eight political parties Stortinget These institu tional arrangements with diverse political party interests add to the com plexity of the policymaking process Norway has been identified as a rather unusual case with regard to the relationship between NGOs and policy makers Hermansen et al Dryzek et al observed a close relationship between these groups and the state in Norway in a system that values consensus Environmentfocused groups are able to participate in the committee stage of policy development In many respects this reduces the watchdog and attention raising role usually played by such groups The experience of the WWF in arguing through committees for a ban on singleuse plastics in Norway has been long running Some prog ress was achieved in when the government agreed to impose a lim ited EPR scheme for these plastics WWF As a result of the institutional context municipal governments are key policy actors in Norway in achieving sustainability goals Research suggest that there has been some progress in many areas of environmental policy in particular regarding pollution and waste For example the part of SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO household waste which is recycled has increased from close to in some municipalities Such results highlight the potential influence of municipal governments in this aspect of waste policy Unfortunately household waste per person has increased by more than and the trend is projected to increase over the next decade Espigares et al Furthermore with respect to sustainable development increasing conflicts of interests over the use of land and natural resources in Norway have been an issue in terms of safeguarding public interests in landuse planning including environmental protection Research on sustainability in the Oslo Kommune is one example of the dilemmas faced There tends to be a low level of demand for sustainability as a value when compared with projects promoting economic development Andersen and Skrede While the municipalitys legal or formal authorities plan for a sustainable development powerful policy actors such as real estate devel opers are able to ensure that the notion of sustainability fits within a model that ensures profitability over environmental concerns Such attitudes flow into waste management ideas whereby Oslo is investing heavily in both recycling facilities and incineration as economic opportunities for the city Oslo Kommune One challenge to waste recycling and re circulation of materials is the partial lockin that can be caused through municipal commitments to and investments in incineration for energy recovery with Denmark Sweden and Norway While this may reduce municipal waste companies commitment to waste prevention and mate rial recycling it gives the impression that waste is being managed effectively Norways largest waste industry group Avfall Norge is a key policy actor as a trade association for waste management and recycling compa nies It has municipal and intermunicipal solid waste organisations approximately associated members cover about of Norways municipalities directly or via an intermunicipal organisation Avfall Norge a The association has mobilised industry action and has lob bied the government to do more about coordination between agencies and strengthening regulations to prevent contaminated construction waste entering the waste stream One consequence of this lack of coordi nation by governments is inconsistency across departments in their pur chasing regimes that fail to ensure that stronger requirements of suppliers and manufacturers meet EPR requirements Avfall Norge b Avfall Norge has also been pressuring the government to make a decision on the location of new landfill sites and strengthening regulations on hazardous waste The association has been most critical of government inaction on S M JONES waste regulations and for allowing the continuation of conditions that support free riding of EPR schemes by packaging companies In other compelling critiques Avfall Norge argues that the legislative weaknesses identified will prevent Norway advancing towards a circular economy Avfall Norge a The government position on the policymaking pro cess suggest that they believe policy actors have better insight into the opportunities and challenges facing specific wasterelated industries As a result the government claims that it has been strengthening cooperation in the process industry sector between business and industry partners the public administration and researchers and has established a longterm strategic forum called Prosess NMCE a Early initiatives suggest that this approach includes stakeholders from the industrial and research sectors Innovation Norway the Research Council and the Norwegian Environment Agency Results suggests that Norwegian minis tries have been undertaking consultation however they tend to focus on their own evidence over other expert sources SteinerKhamsi et al Policy Ideas Waste management is currently viewed largely through the economic ideas that frame waste as a resource that needs to be managed for its value As a key objective of the circular economy approach effective management of waste is seen as an important contributor to longterm sustainable eco nomic growth When policymakers frame a problem it can dictate whether and how it will be treated Ideational processes help provide the explana tion for a dynamic approach to policy change in which change or conti nuity is possible through ideas and discursive interaction in politics Kangas et al Ideas have a role in helping to shape the policy agenda Whether waste is framed in economic or environmental terms will also influence which stakeholders seek to contribute to influencing the policy change For example how a government frames waste as a problem will shape the way it will be examined and the potential solutions pursued Agenda setting is about a government recognising that a problem is a public problem worthy of attention It is often considered the most criti cal stage in the policy process as limited resources mean that governments can only prioritise a limited number of public problems at any particular time Wu et al There is more likelihood of policy change if an issue reaches the governments policy agenda SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO As a member of the EU the approaches taken by Belgian governments largely reflect the ideas of the Towards a circular economy A zero waste programme for Europe emphasising the link between circular economy and waste management Belgian policy documents regard the economic gains of the circular economy and the future prosperity of the country rather than sustainability or environmental benefits OVAM b In the majority of instances the Belgian approaches have been in accordance with focusing on promoting recycling and reducing landfill The underly ing idea has been one of selfsufficiency and the recovery of waste as a resource OVAM a The focus on sorting at the household level is designed to improve the quality of recycling outputs and reduce disposal by transferring Similarly the ban on landfill and the limitations on incin eration are designed to raise the volume of material capable of being recy cled From to OVAM emphasised the environmental benefits of the management of household waste through the Implementation Plan for Environmentally Responsible Waste Management In the focus moved towards emphasising waste prevention more reuse and raising tar gets for the collection of packaging The responsibility for packaging has been a key requirement of industry in Belgium and VALPAC and Fost Plus collect and pr ocess packaging waste There have been some concerns expressed regarding the changes in EU ideas about waste management The EU Directive on waste is potentially problematic for the future of the Flemish waste management The recycling targets under this directive are much lower than what is already achieved in Flanders so it may not give Flanders incentives to improve its recycling rates or to keep them at their existing level The EU Directive also redefines some incin erators as recovery rather than disposal which is likely to push incinera tion further to the detriment of recycling This new idea is contrary to the longstanding view in Belgium that prefers recovery to disposal The Norwegian government released the Strategy for Green Competitiveness in as a key milestone and a catalyst for moving Norway towards a circular economy As the EU is Norways largest export market the EU initiative for a transition to a circular economy is seen to have implications for Norwegian business and industry The Strategy points to the necessity for companies to prepare to compete in the context of strict rules on resource efficiency Business has been encouraged to take more responsibility for products along the whole value chain The EU initiatives to establish a circular economy have been framed by the Norwegian government as primarily both a waste management problem S M JONES and an economic opportunity for local companies that can offer new smart green solutions and technology that will improve resource effi ciency NMCE a The result has been a close relationship between industry and government in terms of framing environment policy arguments in favour of business interests A longterm preference by the Norwegian government has been to establish voluntary agreements with industry The government sets regulatory boundaries and expectations and requires industry participant to achieve specific targets within agreed time frames The most successful and widely known EPR arrangement is the recycling of approximately of plastic bottles since by using a nationwide EPRbased bottle deposit scheme The scheme is seen to demonstrate the responsiveness of business to such incentives and the will ingness of the Norwegian public to participate in reverse vending arrange ments if they are easily accessible Voluntary schemes in Norway reflect the framing of waste as an issue for industry These schemes have been the preference since the early s and there has been research critiquing their effectiveness for some time The weaknesses will have implications for substantial circular initia tives should they be adopted Critics of the Norwegian approach to EPR point to the voluntary participation resulting in distortion in the market Free riders who benefit from the scheme without contributing to its cost are able to sell their products at a lower cost For Avfall Norge this has been the underlying weakness of the Norwegian schemes that has not been addressed through stronger regulation Avfall Norge b Effective EPR schemes are seen to be fundamental to the success of circu lar economy as they have potential to improve sustainability of products reduce reliance on disposal technologies and lower costs Harmonisation of approaches to EPR across the EU is proposed as an important first step that could lead to reducing the impacts of the current weaknesses experi enced in individual countries Leal Filho et al Problem Characteristics This dimension of the framework points to the aspects of a policy problem prompting policy change Kingdon argues that governments have a long list of problems that they could attend to and that decisionmakers pay attention to some problems and ignore others Sometimes their attention is affected by more or less a systemic indicator of a problem At other times a dramatic event seizes their attention or feedback from the SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO operation of existing programmes suggests all is not well ibid In the case of waste we have seen through the case studies that current indi cators show that consumption is producing volumes of waste beyond the capacity of waste management systems to cope The current crisis has revealed that recycling has been failing to achieve expected targets as a result of poor management practices and ineffective policy responses to establish a market for recycled materials particularly plastics In the case of the circular economy the crisis relating to recycling practices in many OECD countries has created a situation where governments have been forced to respond As a result the focus on waste management as a key problem for the transition to a circular economy has been driven by the calls for government action to respond to the crisis situation What should be done about managing waste has become the central problem rather than how to prevent waste in the first place Kingdon suggests that any given policy problem has an improved chance of rising in the policy agenda as a priority if coupled with another pressing preexisting problem The experiences of Belgium and Norway suggest that the combination of a crisis situation and the problem of missed economic opportunities has reinforced the need for a policy response Viewing waste as an industry implies that waste diversion is the preferred solution to the problem of managing increasing volumes of waste which benefits vested interests seeking to expand economic oppor tunities in recycling landfill and energy Bulkeley and Gregson Ignoring consumption curtails the capacity of waste prevention plans to reduce the generation of waste The evidence from the case studies sug gests that there are some improvements in the management of waste for example there have been increasing rates of recycling by industry in Belgium Belgian regional governments have been effective in establishing waste management policies that reflect aspects of waste as a problem in the con text of a circular economy They have been comparatively successful in recycling waste as they have been willing to apply a suite of policy instru ments that include compulsory requirements and financial incentives to encourage behaviour change Legislated stewardship requirements for packaging producers have also contributed to high levels of recycling both household and business waste In addition the Belgian experience shows that it is very important that such instruments be supported by a system of levies The case study has focused particularly on the experience of the Flanders region as it appears to have taken waste policy action as a policy S M JONES priority over time For Flanders the waste management policy encom passes targets for environmental improvement economic growth and social development all of which are in harmony with circular economy principles The government of Flanders also wants to uncouple the pro duction of waste from increasing consumption Since Flanders through OVAM has continued to set ambitious per capita waste reduc tion targets This objective remains unchanged even in the context of social and economic changes that are seeing increasing numbers of smaller households increasing consumption and the reduction of the average life cycle of products increases the production of waste materials OVAM a The Nordic Council of Ministers report shows that municipal waste generation in Norway is higher than the OECD or EU average although the reported household waste fraction corresponds to the OECD average Papineschi et al While there have been some important achievements in the recycling of certain elements of plastic waste and ewaste more needs to be done in other sources of waste if Norway con tinues to deal with the challenges of managing waste in the context of EU directives Despite this long standing issues continue such as waste pollu tion entering ecological systems like marine litter and microplastics in the Norwegian Sea NMCE b The export of hazardous waste from Norway increased from thousand tonnes in to thousand tonnes in Policy actors such as Avfall Norge have been lobbying for government interventions in this important area of waste Avfall Norge c Only France with thousand tonnes has a higher rate than Norway These are the only recorded figures provided by Norway in a context where EU countries report annually To compare this figure Belgiums with double Norways population export of hazardous waste in was thousand tonnes and thousand tonnes in Eurostat Reasons for the export increase from Norway include an insufficient combustion capacity and a ban on the landfilling of biodegrad able waste coupled with changes in economic and market factors Malinauskaite et al The experience of Belgium and Norway also highlights some weak spots preventing a more comprehensive transition from a linear to a cir cular economy Each region shows the challenge of taking policy action to preventing the growth of waste through reducing consumption Action in this area is a cornerstone of the circular economy as it prevents the use of raw materials entering the waste cycle however there appears to be a lack SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO of commitment in both countries to seriously challenge consumption as a policy priority The revised Waste Framework Directive EU strengthens this requirement but does not introduce binding quantified targets for waste prevention Circular economy necessitates redesigning material life cycles to reduce the volume of materials used This is a diffi cult area for government action due to the complexities of waste as a pol icy problem There is a tension between promoting economic growth and taking the seemingly counterintuitive action to change behaviour and lower levels of consumption Belgium and Norway have some of the high est net financial wealth by households in the EU Minne et al Research suggests that as country becomes richer the composition of its waste changes With more money comes more packaging imports elec tronic waste and broken toys and appliances Hoornweg et al During the global financial crisis from to Belgian private con sumption still recorded an average annual growth rate of about well above the average pace that was observed in neighbouring countries Decades of learned consumption based on linear approaches will require increased political priority to establish longterm effective policy measures previously off limits to governments in marketbased economies ConClusion The political priority framework highlights some fundamental challenges for advancing a circular economy The experience of Belgium and Norway reveals the complexities evident in multilevel systems that provide added challenges particularly in the area of waste management as a key element of advancing circular approaches The material covered in this book has produced important insights for stakeholders in other multilevel systems intending to move towards a circular economy After considering the determinants of according these issues a higher priority for policy change outlined in the framework we have some understanding of the complexi ties that may emerge in transitioning from the linear to the circular econ omy Political priority will be required for policy change to support acting on the key objectives beyond recycling and waste management Negotiating the idiosyncrasies of policymaking around circular issues in individual political contexts will also play an important role in determining policy change once political priority has been achieved The complexity of waste as a policy problem contributes to the barriers and opportunities of achiev ing priority on the policy agenda This will have implications for advancing S M JONES a circular economy as the sustainable management of waste is a central element of a transition from the established linear approaches Achieving effective circular economy objectives requires a political pri ority to implement policies that address all stages of the materials life cycle One area common to government efforts to promote a circular economy is the lack of focus on reducing consumption Serious action to stem the flow of increasing volumes of waste is becoming a critical issue Challenges need to be faced by individual consumers and industry as the generators of waste They must assume a high degree of responsibility for placing contaminants into the recycling system that the waste management system must deal with Thornton The Government of Flanders has set a general goal of reducing consumption without specifying what this actu ally means or entails Norway seems to have avoided the issue altogether as it is not mentioned in documents related to the circular economy The Strategy for Green Competitiveness only mentions encouraging green con sumptionnot reducing consumption Attention to this aspect of waste management will be critical to advancing the circular model Both Belgium and Norway show that as consumption levels continue to rise there is a corresponding increase in the volumes of waste Neither country has suc cessfully broken the link between consumption and waste The crisis with plastic waste and the consequent threat to marine ecosystems provides a valuable opportunity to frame that debate about consumption Policymakers need to remember that largely as a result of the waste crisis the issue of trust in government infuses debates about sustainability and recycling The framework shows that ideational framing will be an impor tant element in contributing to a policy priority for change Policy actors can contribute to framing aspects of waste policy that support the need for policy change Government focus has been on framing recycling as the right thing to do in terms of limiting environmental damage This has largely been directed at consumers in Belgium who carry the burden through house hold sorting requirements Framing waste as a valuable resource not to be lost has also contributed to the introduction of EPR schemes in both countries that require limited responsibilities on packaging manufacturers to support recycling Further work needs to be undertaken to establish ideas about framing consumption in such a way that it becomes part of the policy agenda Progress on addressing the transition to a circular economy and achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal to promote sus tainable production and consumption will depend on changing or SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS UNSUST AINABLE STATUS QUO limiting human behaviour which must include restricting consumption As Hood suggests we need to place value on conspicuous non consumption and r euse if we are to advance circular approaches Even if societies determine that restrictions need to be imposed individual atti tudes and beliefs about restricting consumption will be important to achieving longterm reductions Research reveals that changing con sumption behavior will depend on changing intentions attitudes expecta tions and perceived control all of which are malleable and can be targeted either individually or a population level Santor et al Research suggests that government policies can have significant effects on low car bon consumption behaviour among which policy factors include informa tion feedback and information cue carbon labels normative tips etc economic policies technical policies and mandatory administrative regula tions Ding et al The Household Preferences for Reducing GHG Emissions HOPE project reveals that in the EU at least targeted regulations can be viewed positively for driving changes in attitudes norms or practices could shape consumption Dubois et al In fact the authors report that we may have to rely on forced consump tion changes in order to buy us time to take advantage of technology to replace many high energy consuming products and services such as motor vehicles and international travel ibid Other research shows that tar geting specific domains of consumption will be far more difficult and costly than targeting consumption in general although it remains an open question which approach general or specific is more affective at changing both intentions and behavior Santor et al Such issues should become a key element of future research on political priority for pol icy change Given this understanding the following scenario can be proposed as a summation of the current circumstances in respect of government policy advancing the circular economy as a solution to the waste crisis The pr oblems of pursuing all of the objectives of the circular econ omy are difficult for governments to develop an effective response key aspects are phenomena with which governments are reluctant to deal for example reducing consumption Key policy actors want to be seen to be doing something they have made public statements suppor ting a transition to a circular econ omy developed plans and strategies that appear to commit to change S M JONES Some of the policy actors ar e driven by strong ideological commit ment to promote sustainability and economic development as nec essary conditions for the future Others are driven by vested interests that recognise economic opportunities The r esult is a series of actions that are presented as policy change for example recycling and waste to energy proposals are promoted These actions may equally be the thrashing around of a system that needs to be seen as active but does not really know what to do To support their cause policy actors use rational action language to support what is essentially limited action referen Ces ABC Canada to ban single use plastic bags  newsbreakcanadatobansingleuseplastics Andersen B Skrede J
