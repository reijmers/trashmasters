focus on the topic of circular economy in the context of sustainable development as one major objective of todays societies circular economy is mostly characterized by the need t o improve the use of resourcesby reducing waste and recycling under the sustainable development broader circumstances circular economy becomes one of the important part of providing resources for the future generations based on intra and intergenerational solidarity having as starting points the r reuse recirculation recycling and extending the lifecycle of products also a circular economy is an important factor to develop the smart cities the smart city can be understood as a sustainable city a city well performing in economy governance but also in environment and living the paper aims to identify a set of major actions recommended at the european union level in order to promote this vision it aims as well to highlight some of the economic and institutional barriers that might be faced at all economic levels the eu recommendations associated with the trends of increasing the prices of raw materials and also with the need to reduce the import dependency such as better ensure the energetic security and sustainability by respecting the imperatives of environment protection require a focus on efforts towards these directions starting from these approaches we analyzed the progress achieved by romania in the last ten years and the extent to which the country is prepared to implement an efficient management of municipal waste in order to promote the circular economy vision based on the progresses obtained in the last decade we appreciate that romanian decision makers had understood the importance of circular economy and had taken some specific action dedicated to the focus on this direction although some of the indicators referring to recycling show an improvement in romania it still has to improve performance in this field we consider that one of t he main challenge s for the future in terms of circular economy refers to the further development of the sectors associated with the circularity of resource and with the emergence of employment opportunities based both on an active involvement of public and private sectors index terms circular economy municipal waste linear economy sustainable development recycling smart cities i introduction in the context of a smart sustainable and inclusive development as important prerequisites of europe strategy there is an increasingly role played by the technological progress designed to facilitate an efficient and effective use of resources in order to reduce waste and to allow the application of more and better procedures by these means we consider that the natural reconstruction of resources will not be substantially improved and thus we will not be able to ensure enough quantities of resources for the future generations for applying the intergenerational justice principles as illustrated within the literature an economy based on these principles can be considered to function like a circular economy it concerns also a production and consumption model based on the reuse and recycling of materials such as to contribute to the extension this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution license for more information see  article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal but

reality based on a broader vision of the circular economy we have to take into account not only the consumption and production of goods and services but also a better and more efficient and effective use of renewable energy as well as the transformation of waste in materials dedicated to new production flows this broader vision requires a cross disciplinary systemic and holistic approach of the functioning of the economy as an integrated system in which each element influences the functionality of the whole system many nations are promoting more and more this vision mo stly considering the environmental and population growth challenges in the context of the smart cities it is necessary to combine competitiveness and sustainable urban development simultaneously fundamental components of a smart city are technology factors digital and information city institutional factors smart growth and human factors knowledge learning city cities have to improve quality of life by creating efficiency and by a better use of resources so a smart city is based on a circular economy which means both an increase in the economic and social value by increase in the value of products and by improvement in working conditions but also an increase in the environment value by the resilience of natural resources this paper focus on the analyze of the state of the transition process towards a circular economy in romania in the context of the current recommendations and requirements for a better development of this type of economy at the eu level our paper starts with a concept ual analysis of the term of circular economy that despite it had been widely debated in recent years has no an unanimously accepted definition then we analyze the state of the circular economy in romania considered under the larger umbrella of the euro pean union context highlighting the main strengths and weaknesses of the transition process toward a circular economy the paper is addressed to the researchers and decision makers from romania because it targets a quite insufficiently developed topic focusing both on the challenges and opportunities that decision makers have to be able to identify in order to adopt the proper policies strategies and ways of action in the future ii circular economy literature review despite the fact that the term of circular economy had been widely debated over the last years we consider that it is not yet sufficiently developed mostly considering its purpose and the complex relationships with other concepts european union but also many other nations such as china and japan consider circular economy as a key solution for food and water security and for a longterm sustainable socio and economic development korthonen et al consider that the domain of ecological economics is one of the most appropriate inspirational sources of the circular economy mostly considering the general functional background and its policies and practices michelini et al show that the current linear socioeconomic system with discard products at the end of their life cycle is the main cause of natural depletion they consider the most important goal of the circular economy as one of the new economics model in which the restoration and circularity of the product components will be the appropriate response to the inefficient resource management unlike the linear economy based on an extensive use of resources which has negative impacts on environment due to the waste generation the circular economy invol ves the reutilization of the materials such as the waste from the manufacturing process to become a potential materials source for another process the central idea is to retain resources in the production processes based on their reutilization by producing more value added for a longer period of time in a production system as closed as possible the adoption of the circular economy concept refers mostly to two distinct directions customer interface by proposing value to customers and suppliers net works by reconciliation of the producers own internal activity no matter the direction it is generally considered that the circular economy is a combination of three main concepts reducing resources consumption reusing waste and recycling activiti es all the three concepts result finally in economic and environmental prosperity by providing social equity both for actual and future generations according to the intergenerational justice principle some authors highlighted the connection between the two concepts conditioning sustainability by the existence of circular economy the similarities between the two concepts refer to the integration of noneconomic aspects in the development equation considering cross disciplinary holistic approaches these highlight the increasing of both costs and risks associated with the need for more incentives regulations and for a better cooperation between the stakeholders from different economic levels the key issue in assuring a sustainable development is the flow of transferring materials and energy between nature and human the pressure on environment is higher due also to the global population growing and thus to an increasing population consumption all these challenges and transformations ask for rethinking the sustainable development based on the principles of circular economy by using cyclical materials ows renewable energy sources and cascading type energy ows the concept of sustainable development had evolved in time and is based on the longterm vision of development that takes into account more and more the need to assure this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution license for more information see  article has been accepted for

countries and generations and the interconnections between the economic social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development the current technological evolutions make it necessary to take into account the technological sector mostly in the context of the amplified importance of the knowledge and innovative based economy under these broader cross disciplinary approaches we consider it is important to illustrate the complex and dynamic interactions between the economic social technological and environmental dimensions of development as a central pillar for sustainability effectiveness and circular economy figure figure major interactions between economic social technological and environmental dimensions of sustainability source designed by the authors as illustrated in figure no the most important relationships between the economic social technological and environmental dimensions of sustainability are environment considered as a natural input representing the main resources provider economic presure on environment and public implication for assuaring a healthy environment and for an efficient recycling process the care for preserving heavily renewable resources and for increasing the use of renewable resources the contraint of creating and using new technologies which use smaller quantities of resources to reuse resources and recycle them the human and enviroment health the presure on the environment and the increasing need of preserving and protecting the environment the characteristics of human resources eg the consumption paterns the quality of human capital a more equitable distribution of revenues among societies members according to micro and macroeconomic objectives influencing the occupational structure in accordance with the requirements of implementing the new technological way of productions the constant need to develop new technologies for improving the future communitys socioeconomic existence providing technologies in accordance with new requirements of recycling and circular economy investments for new ecotechnologies banaite and tamasiuniene appreciate that in order to assure a better functionality of the circular economy there have to be taken into account three perspectives that are also highly correlated these perspectives refer to the environmental impact economic benefits and to the resources scarcity that should request a more intensive collaboration between nations both public and local administrations and the whole society goals and targets have to be set at the microeconomic mezzo and macroeconomic levels starting from firms industries levels and moving towards local municipalities and finally towards the whole country and to the eu level they refer to stock optimization ecoefficiency and eco effectiveness waste reduction the concept of the circular economy had became better known at the end of the s when the initial idea of functioning of living systems was extended to the industrial processes and economic systems more studies attribute the introduction of the circular economy concept to pearce and turner these authors showed that the economy was develop ed by using the natural resources for production and consumption without taking into account the recycling of waste these types of approaches were also influenced by bouldings work which describes the earth as a circular system which has a limited capacity of waste assimilation requiring a better cooperation between economy and environment nowadays the term of circular economy has become more complex by incorporating many concepts used in fields that focus on sustainability such as industrial ecology ecoefficiency waste management renewable energy recycling smart cities bocken et al define circular economy as a business model which is slowing closing and narrowing resource loops bonciu considers circular economy a new frame of mind a new perspective xiao and huang a ne w path of industrialization and preston a paradigm shift in the way things are made many authors appreciate circular economy as a system which replaces the concepts such as end oflife with reuse of wastes and their reduction through a better quality design of products materials and systems reike et al and blomsma and brennan divided the evolution of circular economy concept into three periods the period

ecoefficiency and the third phase since until today focusing on the maximizing value retention in the age of resource depletion the first period in which the awareness of resources exhaustion appears the wastes management has become more and more problematic stand s out by the publication of the club of rome marking the passage to the next period the second period is characterized by the increase of ecological movements and by measures focused especially on the reduction of pollution it had focused on regulating the wastes management in landfills and their cremation in this period it is considered that there are the most important roots of circular economy focusing on recycling and on concepts such as cleaner production and industrial ecology the third period is marked by an increase in the awareness of resources exhaustion as a consequence of their excessive exploitation having to face also an increase of population in many regions of the word as highlighted by some authors under the auspices of circular economy it is possible to obtain and keep economic growth based on using fewer resources improving the production technologies using recycled raw materials and using renewable energy the study of vut et al shows the existence of a direct connection between the measures adopted to increase the productivity of resources associated to circular economy and the increase the gdp the authors consider also that in order to obtain a sustainable economic growth we have to focus on the recycling of waste which lead also to a decrease in the costs of production according to the approaches identified within the literature the concept of circular economy is tackled differently as there are many definitions between which we can see there are more or less interferences for instance kirchherr et al emphasize based on the analysis of definitions that there might be a risk that based on such a high number of approaches the concept might collapse due to a relatively constant conceptual contention that might affect not only the research but also the practice iii circular economy at the european union level european union defines circular economy as a n economy where the value of products materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible and the generation of waste minimized this is the basis for the development of smart cities that also means the use of information and communication technologies for better resource use and less emissions many european union countries have implemented special initiatives dedicated to the development of the circular economy based on policies and pilot programmes especially in germany united kingdom denmark norway and the netherlands these countries have stood out by the speed with which they implemented measures of supporting circular economy both at the governmental and company levels at the eu level the efforts for developing circular economy have amplified lately by adopting special designed packages of measures and strategies stimulating the transition towards a circular economy they aim at some strategic targets such as recycling all plastic packaging until introducing some compulsory recycling rates for different categories of wastes increasing the use of raw materials resulted from recycling reducing by the food wastes until increasing the recycling rate of municipal wastes by until at the eu level environmental policy became legally binding by the single european act in after the un conference in stockholm the first action programme for the environment for the medium term for the eu had been developed so far many special designed programs have been developed with this purpose these programs had been recalibrated shifting from a focus on the qualitative approach the need to protect water and air towards more quantitative approach that focus on pollutant emission and integrating the concept of sustainable development within the eu strategies dedicated to the environmental protection in order to monitor the progress obtained in the process of transition towards the circular economy at the eu level experts analyse indicators covering the areas of production consumption waste management creation of new jobs generated by the development of the circular economy as there is not only one aggregate indicator which measures the circular economy the monitoring reports of implementation of circular economy at the eu level are based on a group of indicators which are divided into categories these categories are production and consumption waste management secondary raw materials and competitiveness and innovation according to the last report out of billion tons of materials processed every year in the eu which turn into products or energy only billion tons come from recycling thus out of billion tons of wastes reenter in the system under the form of recycled materials the benefits of transition towards a circular economy are the reduction of pressure on environment energy saving reduction of co emissions reduced waste management costs improvement of supply with raw materials stimulating innovation and the creation of new jobs as a result the demand for raw materials decreases as many materials are preserved or waste is returned into the production process this implies decreasing import dependency and reducing the vulnerability of industries in this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution license for more information see  article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of

supply caused by resource depletion scarcity or other geopolitical complex factors there are barriers to implement circular economy on the european union level kirchherr et al refer to cultural barriers expressed by the lack of consumer interest and the hesitant company culture driven by market barriers induced by some inconsistent governmental intervention designed to accelerate t he speed of transition process towards circular economy even if circular economy might be attractive for companies ritzen and olundh show that there are many financial structural operational and technological barriers these barriers had been anal yzed in correlation with innovation management these authors highlighted that a radical change is needed in order to assure a quite strong connection between sustainability and the business development model as many other transition processes passing to wards circular economy might imply an uneven distribution of results between workers costumers companies industrial sectors regions considering that some groups might benefit while other might lose european union experts consider that circular economy implies some challenges related to sharing leasing reusing repairing recycling process the first major challenge faced during the implementation of circular economy process is the finance one both for public and private sectors it incl udes new costs for asset investment research and development but also public expenditure focusing on subsidy and investments in the waste management the second important challenge refers to the lack of an institutional framework properly designed to sti mulate and encourage an efficient resource s reuse and recycling the third challenge of transition towards circular economy is the quality of the human capital unprepared yet for the new technical skills required by the new concept this third challenge i mplies also financial costs for companies in order to invest in special dedicated training programs for the existing workforce or for offering increased wages to attract highly skilled workers finally an important challenge of switching form a linear tow ards a circular economy is the one generated by the complexity of consumers behavior which needs changes and improvements surpassing all these boundaries ask for the implementation of a set of actions designed in a distinctive way according to different levels and policy areas the circular economy generates complex relations between production consumption waste and recycling as shown in figure figure complex relations that arise within the circular economy source designed by the authors circular economy involves the reduction of consumption of raw materials the design of products to make it easier to use and the extension of lifecycle of the products by maintenance and repairs when the products get in the waste stage it has to aim at their recycling and their next reintroduction within the production process iv circular economy in romania in european union context there are many reasons that justify why romania needs to develop circular economy some of these reasons refer to the need of resources for assuring the national security and environmental protection increasing welfare under the conditions of the limitation of resources adding value by minimizing costs of raw material solving the problem of waste also the climate change affects the availability of natural resources and through the development of a circular economy some resources can be recovered and reused we consider that romania is at the beginning of its transition towards a circular economy as it can be noticed from the comparing analysis of specific indicators with european union as a whole table table comparative analysis of the circular economy indicators romania and eu year indicators ro eu ro eu resource productivity eur per kg resource productivity index domestic material consumption per capita tones per capita water

all waste generated i n a country per inhabitant and year excluding major mineral wastes dredging spoils and contaminated soils mil tones source eurostat eu policy indicators circular economy considering the efficiency of resources use measured by the economic value of gdp generated by each kilogram of resources used from natural environment we can notice that romania obtained only euro in for each kilogram of resources a decreasing value compared to and at large distance from eu average of euro times higher in this indicator represented compared to the level recorded in in romania and compared ro eu the same period in terms of the domestic consumption of resources measured in tonscapita we found that romania recorded an increase between and from tons to tons by while the indicator decreases in eu even if romania recorded economic growth in the analysed period we also have to mention that the growth ra te of consumption of resources exceeds the growth rate of gdp this shows that romania uses more and more natural resources but produces low economic value as a result of the fact that in general it exports mostly raw material and not especially finis hed products as it is recommended for a longrun sustainable development the economic value which romania produces with every m of water extracted from the natural environment is euro which shows a lower productivity compared to other european union countries the highest productivity level of water is recorded in luxembourg and denmark the lower level of greenhouse gas emissions per capita recorded by romania compared to the eu average illustrates the lack of an active industry the generation of waste in romania represents of eu waste generation analyzing waste generation in tones per inhabitant can be noticed that in tones was generated in eu and tones in romania romania exceeds the eu average being on the th place at waste generated per inhabitant in after finland tones estonia tones luxembourg tones bulgaria tones and sweden tones one explanation might be that in romania the economic growth is mostly based on consumption and there has not yet been developed a mentality that promotes also the environmental concerns at the eu average level in of waste was recycled and only in romania in romania most of the waste generated is landfill the highest recycling rates are recorded in belgium latvia italy and slovenia european union developed an aggregate indicator that expresses the circularity of materials within the consumptionproduction flow the circular material use rate measures the share of material recovered and fed back into the economy in overall material use at european union level of total material represents secondary materials thus saving extraction and using the primary raw materials countries like netherlands belgium and france have the highest circular material use rate around or above this indicates that secondary materials substitute for primary raw materials at a level that indicates a better understanding of the importance and the conceptualization of the circular economy concept which implies reusing the materials into the production flows the levels recorded by ireland romania and greece below indicate the need for progress and special designed policies adopted within this sector together with an increasing public awareness of the importance of reducing environmental impact by using secondary materials figure figure circular material rate use of total material use eu refers to circular material use rate is influenced by the level of economic development of eu countries the statistical data show the existence of a direct correlation between the level of economic convergence expressed by gdp as percent of eu average and circular material

ieee access volume xx figure corelation between circular material rate and gdp source computation based on eurostat statistics as the economies and societies continue to develop they move towards a higher level of human needs and as a consequence a higher attention is paid to some aspects which surpass the economic area so that they understand and get a higher level of awareness of the importance of security in order to better assure resources for the medium and long term we consider that the first stage of the circular economy development is the creation of new employment opportunities within this sector this involves on one hand the existence of a technological basis for the operationalization of this process and on the other hand the existence of skilled workforce in this field for less eu developed countries both directions can be limited by the lack of resources the technicalmaterial base and the human capital situation that involv es the allocation of important financial resources at the european union level share of the employment in circular economy sector refers to employment in recycling repai r reuse rental and leasing sector because at an economy level it is important not only the level of employment but also its qualit y reflected in the results obtained we have calculated the work productivity per employed person in the circular economy at the eu level the results showed that countries with a relatively high weight of workers within circular economy compared to eu average have a low labour productivity this shows that this sector needs supplementary investments and measures that stimulate the private investments in a field being just at the beginning of its existence even if the effects of using secondary materials as substitute for primary raw materials are not necessarily evaluated in short term lower labour productivity per employed person compared to share of employment in the field recorded countries from central and eastern europe hungary poland slovenia romania bulgaria because they are making effort to comply with the eu requirements with a background of an insufficiently qualified labour force figure figure employment in circular economy sector and labour productivity per employed person eu refers to source eurostat statistics despite these aspects we consider that there are also progresses that had been made in terms of recycling different type of waste within the european union this is a remarkable progress designed to ensure the consumption of future generations but it is also a great challenge romania has made progress in terms of recycling packaging waste increasing from a rate of in to in it was a fast convergence process with the eu average of recycling rate in also progresses were made in romania and eu in terms of recycling municipal waste and biowaste for romania steps should be passed further in order to ensure a closer level to european union and as a consequence an efficient waste management waste policy circular economy is characterized by more adapted production processes to the development of sustainable goods aiming to increase the possibility of a fast and efficient recovery of recyclable materials from products at the end of use period it is also characterized by the existence of more rational and better educated consumers who care more for the exhaustible resources of the planet and for assuring the prerequisite for the consumption of future generations and who understand the importance of exploitation at the highest level the resources already included into the production processes according to courvoisier sennes ricard ribeyre and caeiro sustainable consumption is mainly driven by education these authors highlight the role of education in the formation of a more responsible consumption behaviour also varelacandamio novocorti and garciaalvarez show that environmental education reveals as a powerful tool in order to generate green behaviour among citizens through an econometrical study on spain the investment in consumer education both on the formal and informal levels allows the creation of a core set of skills that contribute to the improvement of the lifestyle of the consumers to ensuring and maintaining the environmental health which is considered as a mid and longterm personal social and economic advantage this work is

promote recycling implementation of programs and projects at romanian public universities and companies the study of novocorti et al shows that the economic higher education system in romania has started with small steps designed to adapt to environmental requirements romanian educational system is interested in organizing special dedicated programs projects and debates focusing on sustainable developmental issues and in introducing such courses v the management of municipal waste in romania as one of the key pillars of the transition towards the circular economy at the eu level the th environment action programme called our choice our future had drawn for the first time the attention on waste management regarding the objective of increasing the degree of recycling and preventing their creation the first distinct approach of the problem of waste and recycling prevention and recycling of waste was launched in as a thematic strategy for the th environment action plan it aims at improving waste management by recycling in order to reduce the negative impact on the environment this concern was also used within the plan called living well within the limits ot our planet implemented in which pays a particular attention to the transformation of waste into a resource by emphasizing the importance of some preventive measures reuse and recycling and phasing out wasteful and damaging practices like land filling a special consideration had been given to the management of hazardous waste so as to minimize the effects on environment and human health the new concern of the european union regarding waste management was included in a circular economy package that aims at a greater recycling and reuse during the products lifecycles in order to bring benefits for both the environment and the economy the most important benefit for the economy refer to the savings resulted from the recycling and reuse of scarce resources and to the positive effects of new job creation and investments dedicated to a sustainable growth and development romania as one member of the european union is committed to observe and adopt the community legislation for the environmental policy the principle of subsidiarity single european act was applied for the first time this principle was subsequently recognized by the maastricht treaty as a fundamental operating principle of the eu this implies the union intervention when an issue cannot be resolved satisfactorily at one of the member state level because of its scale or effects the sectors covered by the common environmental policy are waste management water pollution air pollution biodiversity and soil protection in romania in the field of waste management the first national waste management strategy was developed in until now other strategies have been developed in order to better achieve the recycling targets in order to analyze the recycling process we paid a particular attention to municipal waste in smart cities it is important to consider it because in recent years it has had an upward trend due to the population growth urbanization and due to the increasing living conditions and economic growth some researchers show that household waste generation is also influenced by family size education level and by the monthly family income evolution however in order to support the recycling of this kind of waste government authorities and ngos have to be more and better involved by supporting policies designed to encourage recycling such as infrastructure development in the field or providing tax incentives the success of an efficient management of recycling depends on the technological solutions as well as on the links between environmental economic legislative and institutional matters supporting this system omran and schiopu demonstrated using an quantitative analysis based on a questionnaire that actions of households and their perceptions about recycling have an important role in ensuring the success of any sustainable policy for waste management at the local regional or national levels in romania the generation of municipal waste per capita kg per capita has decreased in compared to table table evolution of the generation and recycling of municipal waste i n romania and eu year indicators ro eu generation of municipal wast e per capita kg per capita recycling rate of

eliminated by storage or by incineration which shows that romania is far from the target of the recycling rate of municipal wastes which had been established as a target that has to be reached until

significant progress considering the proposal for reforming the contributions to eu budget since this proposal takes into account a new source of income a national contribution depending on the quantity of plastic packaging wastes which are not recycled this will encourage the transition of eu towards a circular economy by stimulating the member states to reduce the quantity and intensity of such kind of waste the eu waste statistics places romania on the last position in the european union in terms of recycling of municipal waste romania has a recycling rate of just much lower compared to the eu average of romania is far behind the highly developed countries where recycling values had reached figure figure the evolution of the recycling rate of municipal waste of packaging waste and of biowaste in eu and romania between and the trend of municipal waste recycling rate had increased during the period but there are major differences between these indicators registered in romania and the european union figure figure dynamic of recycled rate of municipal waste romania and eu sourceeurostat if we look at the sectors that produce waste in romania compared with those from eu we can observe that in the largest share in terms of waste generation is held by the mining sector and quarrying industry which shows an industry that is still not yet adapted to the principles of sustainable development at the eu level the values of this indicator are divided across industries the construction sector having the largest share of figure figure waste generation by economic activities and households in total romania and eu the total waste generated by economic activities and households can be expressed in correlation to population size in the average amount of waste

mineral waste the evolution of this type of waste shows a connection with the structure of an economy the states with higher mineral waste such as romania bulgaria estonia have conducted significant

categories of products material s according to the study of these authors the rate of recovery and recycling has increased in romania for the following products glass paper plastic metal wood end of life vehicles and packaging waste these increases though not spectacular are favourable for environmental protection and were based on measures to encourage reuse and recycling such as rabla programme for end of life vehicles nevertheless much of the waste generated in romania is not recovered or recycled but destroyed for a better waste management it is highly recommended to join the efforts of municipality public sector corporations and individuals this process of recycling involves the collaboration between all those economic actors interested in environment protection ensuring a healthy economic growth and development it also requires a marketing strategy designed to support waste management which does not exist in romania yet but which could help the improvement of the recycling process although some european union countries had made a significant progress comparing to the others in terms of recycling management efficiency we have to accept that there is no ideal solution adaptable to any economy the development of waste management systems requires time and covers different stages therefore countries that have not yet developed enough such systems like romania might benefit from the experience of highly developed countries but they cannot achieve a great leap in a very short time some basic principles should be taken into consideration in order to contribute to a better more efficient and effective waste management and they might help step by step the development of this system as well the precautionary principle anticipating problems that may arise and reduce waste production the accountability principle the polluter has to pay pollution costs the proximity principle waste should be disposed or processed closer to the area where they were produced considering consumers they might contribute to an increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of waste management process by purchasing organic products with smaller packaging reusing packaging and their separate collection for recycling from this point of view in romania there have been registered some progress but there are still problems that need to be solved both concerning the separate collection of waste and the purchase of organic products which involve higher costs for the consumer they have to do all in order to get the highest benefits from a healthier life and a cleaner environment in return bearing a higher purchase price of the product as illustrated in figure no there is a direct correlation between the recycling rate for packaging waste and the recovery rates for packaging this means that those countries who have high recycling rates have also high recovery rates for waste the most performing countries in recycling and recovery are denmark germany and the netherlands on the other hand the least performing are croatia hungary and latvia according to the official date of european commission romania converge to the european union average both for recycling and recovery rates recording a quite important increases from in to in in the case of the first rate and from in to in in the case of the second figure figure recovery and recycle rate for packaging waste in european union at the company level the support can be achieved through the production of environmentally friendly goods using green technologies and by limiting energy wastage and excessive use of packaging corabieru corabieru and vasilescu draw attention to the importance of the design of the products steps because even in this stage it has to be taken into account their degree of recycling and thus to encourage the development of recycling at this level it has been registered a relatively little progress in romania the analysis of the green business index gbi indicator for romania shows the recycling situation at the level of companies in romania and allow decision makers to understand what the main trends in the field are this indicator examines the environmental responsibility of the companies according to the gbi in only of companies in romania had declared they had adopted a sustainable development strategy and in of these had an environmental

year was increasing to reduce the gap to the highly developed countries concerning the reuse and recycling of waste romanian authorities have to provide the necessary resources to implement effective waste management policies decision makers from different level micro mezzo macro have also to provide the necessary infrastructure for collecting and recycling waste by creating partnerships with business in order to better collect and recycle these resources romania is lagging behind in terms of implementing these policies due to limited financial resources especially due to a low interest manifested by decision makers for these kind of projects specialized studies emphasize the importance of the social issues for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of waste management systems because the public participation in the planning and implementation of these systems are as important as technical and economic issues concerning waste management therefore the increase of the performance of expected results might be achieved through joint efforts of individuals local communities organizations companies and government viconclusions the transition towards the circular economy is very important for romania which has to keep up with the transformations existing at the european level circular economy means more than recycling waste it is a complex way of organizing which involves changes in both production and consumption such as to reduce resource consumption and to minimize waste at the same time the shift to the circular economy must be correlated with the development of smart cities the debate and the practice of circular economy are essential for this transition which is considered to be just on an early stage in romania we consider that efforts made by romanian decision makers on different levels have to be amplified because as highlighted by our paper romanian potential to develop the circular economy as a premise for the development of smart cities is far behind as compared to the eu most developed countries currently the efficiency and effectiveness of resources use in romania is low the recycling rate is among the lowest in the eu most of the waste is deposited or incinerated and it is not yet developed a life cycle of waste management we consider that romania is far from reaching and being convergent with the strategic european targets of circular economy for example the circular material use rate which measures the share of material recovered and fed back to the economy in total material use is only in romania compared to the eu average although some of the indicators on recycling recycling rates of municipal waste recycling biowaste show an improvement for romania because they have increased in compared to romania still has to make progress recycling rate of packaging waste grew from to in the analyzed period getting close to the eu average we consider that in order to develop the circular economy in romania the efforts has to be cumulated both in terms of public and private sectors involvement and concerning also consumers in the future it would be very important for romanian companies how they use their resources such as sustainability to become a driver of innovation and competitiveness by improving the way to apply circular economy principles even if the involvement of private companies and public organizations in joint environmental projects is low decisionmakers from different levels might be more involved through fiscal financial and legislative instruments to support companies investing in the development of the circular economy in this respect public and local authorities have to develop joint programs with educational institutions private companies and non governmental organizations there is a need for applying modern technologies for the operationalization of this process and to assure the existence of a skilled workforce in the field an important role is played by investments both in physical and human capital by educating also consumers who have to be more aware of their role within this process educated consumers will better understand the need to prove rationality in consumption to reduce waste but also the role of recycling adapting consumer behavior to the requirements of the circular economy in order to achieve efficient and effective results the state and companies have to provide the necessary infrastructure for the collection and recycling of waste which is from our point of view quiet poorly developed now in romania companies citizens and authorities have to work together and cooperate to make the systematic changes work within the system based on circular economy also a challenge for the future trend in circular economy in romania is the further development of sectors associated with circularity of resource and the creation of new employment opportunities within this sectors based on both public and private involvement and on publicprivate partnerships our research is a stage in the analysis of smart cities development from the point of view of the circularity although the paper focuses on the study of the circular economy this is an important topic for the transition to smart cities both at the romanian and european union level in the future we will extend the research to study the this work is licensed under a
