However, the implementation of the  circular economy from a local governance point of view has been explored in a rather fragmented manner,  although public policies remain crucial in driving countries towards more circular systems. This paper aims to  explore whether and how local governments contribute to circular economy implementation by applying Voβ  et al.‘s  steering framework for sustainable development. By using desk research analysis and focus group  and individual interview discussions with representatives of municipalities and regional waste management  centres, we identified challenges for implementing the circular economy with a lack of local governments ’  contribution, namely municipal waste management, textile waste, distribution of human resources, networking,  and local business. Finally, we created a framework for circular solutions by mapping national and foreign  practices through five perspectives, namely learning, sharing vision, reflexive governance, regulation, and  negotiation in networks.    1.Introduction  In the context of prevailing unsustainable production and con- sumption models and ecological crises, the circular economy topic gains  momentum. A circular economy is often presented as a practical strategy  for implementing sustainable development (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ;  Van den Bergh, 2020 ). The circular economy puts environmental sus- tainability forward and acknowledges the need for favourable economic  settings , but social sustainability is usually absent  and may even reinforce social inequality (Johansson and Henriksson,  2020 ). The circular economy may be the expression towards weak sus- tainability  as it  suggests a system where recycling and reuse are assumed as substitutes  for raw materials. The urgency behind a circular transformation is based  on a looming resource and ecological crisis  as  well as globalisation and increase of resources consumption (Bonciu,  2014 ).  In practice, the circular economy is implemented in diverse contexts,  from resource efficiency , product design  and product integrity (Stahel,  2010 ), appropriate waste management and recycling (Ghisellini et al.,  2016 ; Murray et al., 2017 ; Knickmeyer, 2020 ), companies ’ practices of  reuse and repair caf˘es , post-consumption  waste transformation into valuable materials (Braungart and McDo - nough, 2002 ), and urban circular initiatives .  Interestingly, the implementation of the circular economy from a  local governance point of view has been explored in a rather fragmented  manner, although public policies remain crucial in driving the EU to- wards a full circular implementation . Historically,  the EU waste legislation is very detailed and mature, since launching the  first EU Packaging Directive in 1994, the End of Life Vehicles Directive  in the late 1990s, and the 2008 Waste Framework Directive. Govern - ments and policy makers mainly of developed countries have attempted  to direct the growing material waste streams back into industry through  recycling programs in order to close the material loop (Lieder and  Rashid, 2016 ). Obviously, it has a direct impact on towns and cities by  laying down waste management priorities and specific targets (e.g.  management of municipal waste, e-waste). More recently, the circular  ☆This work was supported by the Research Council of Lithuania, contract no.

This action plan includes a broader definition of  municipal waste and no longer limits the definition simply to waste that  is collected by local governments .  With half of the global population living in urban areas (towns and  cities), proper urban governance through local governments might play  a significant role by facilitating a state ’s strategies to local communities  and businesses. However, waste collection and recycling rates are het- erogeneous over space, varying among municipalities because of dif- ferences in infrastructure, ways of waste collection, and maturity about  environmental problems . Furthermore, the cir- cular economy is increasingly used as the overarching strategy of  municipal, regional, and international plans to foster green development  . Implementing circularity require systemic trans - formations , which can be hindered when  some actors involved are not aware of the role they are expected to  undertake , especially when it comes to execution.  Therefore, it is expected that municipalities are responsible for facili - tating a state ’s strategies to local communities and businesses and  should take the lead.  Although there are some empirical research studies about munici - palities ’ role to foster the circular economy through hybrid governance  of solid waste management  and urban circular ini- tiatives , the major focus is on  the cases of metropolitan cities (Prendeville et al., 2018 ; Cramer, 2020 ;  Russell et al., 2020 ) or Chinese cities  because of their  economic and social importance, population, density, and urbanisation.  Moreover, most of the previous research studies refer to the reviews  of publicly available documents such as cities ’ or countries ’ strategic  plans and reports , while lacking a  qualitative approach to the problem. Very few articles go into much  depth when discussing “how ” and “what it takes ” to implement circular  economy principles in urban contexts in general  or  how municipalities accept this top-down approach and implement it.  Little attention is paid in the scholarly circular economy literature to the  active role that local governments can play. The lack of fundamental  analyses of the social contexts and institutional conditions under which  the circular economy is being implemented is therefore considered an  important barrier to its contributions to socially just and environmen - tally desirable societal transitions (Moreau et al., 2017 ; Korhonen et al.,  2018 ). In addition, recent research of the circular economy in small open  countries is focused mostly on leaders, such as Belgium, the Netherlands,  Finland, Sweden, Denmark, etc. There is a lack of comprehensive  research about implementation of the circular economy in small econ- omies, which are in the initial stage of the transition to the circular  economy  or on-track to the circular economy  .  Therefore, the pressing question remains to what extent and how  municipalities may contribute to circular economy implementation  across all steps in the value network. The theoretical approach used in  this study refers to an umbrella attitude towards the circular economy  concept as well as Voβ et al.’s  steering framework for sustainable  development.  Our empirical focus is on Lithuanian local governance. Lithuania is a  country which has done well year over year, moving up the rankings in  three circular economy indicators, namely, per capita waste production  and recycling rate of both municipal waste and packaging (EU Circular  Economy Update, 2019 ). There are three incineration plants, and it is  the only one country in the EU which banned the import of waste to  incinerate. Circular economy initiatives are rather limited. The country  does not have any tax incentives in place for circular products or  services.  Our contribution is threefold. First, we expand the knowledge of  challenges to local governments engaging in the circular economy.  Furthermore, we create the practical framework of circular solutions for local governments by mapping national and foreign practices through  five perspectives, namely learning, sharing vision, reflexive governance,  regulation, and negotiation in networks. Our proposed steering solutions  could be implemented beyond the Lithuanian case. In addition, it would  be important to set out a social contribution. This study also aims to raise  legislators ’ awareness about the circular economy, which goes beyond  just waste management, and also includes prevention and active  collaboration with local communities and businesses.  The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the overview of  the circular economy through local governance and its theoretical  foundation, followed by Section 3, which presents the Lithuanian local  governance case. Section 4 explains research methods. In Section 5, the  main results  are presented. Sec- tions 6 and 7 present the discussion and conclusions.  2.Background overview on the circular economy through local  governance  The concept of the circular economy does not belong to one science  discipline, and therefore it is difficult to define. It lacks a strong scientific  basis  and critical discussion (Johansson and Hen- riksson, 2020 ), as it is loosely based on a fragmented collection of ideas  derived from a variety of scientific disciplines and semi-scientific con- cepts . The most known ones include  Cradle-to-Cradle, where waste becomes a value-producing resource  , optimisation of product-services  systems and the “Inertia Principle ” , industrial ecology  , and the Triple Bottom Line (Elkington,  1997 ). Homrich et al.  defined the circular economy as opposition  to linear open-ended systems, aiming to face the challenges of resource  scarcity and waste in a win–win approach between economic and  environmental perspectives. In this paper, we follow Blomsma and  Brennan  with an umbrella approach derived from Hirsch and  Levin  towards the circular economy, that is characterising it as a  relation between pre-existing concepts that were previously unrelated,  or not related in the manner the umbrella concept proposes, by focusing  attention on a particular shared quality or characteristic of the concepts.  By its comprehensive and encompassing content, the circular economy  differs from earlier attempts concerning only selective collection of  waste or individual attempts to recycle or to increase energy efficiency  . In addition, Murray et al.  also refer to the cir- cular economy as a “general term covering all activities that reduce,  reuse, and recycle materials in production, distribution, and consump - tion processes ” .  2.1. Circular economy at local governance  Public sector institutions have a social and fiduciary responsibility to  conserve natural resources and promote social welfare and equity. It has  far greater responsibilities for advancing the notion of sustainable  development when compared to corporations . Lieder  and Rashid  proposed top-down and bottom-up approaches to  support CE implementation. Top-down approach contains legislation  and policy and support infrastructure and social awareness. Hence,  public institutions advocate a collective consciousness about environ - mental issues as well as societal benefit of industrial activities by strict  control of industrial businesses.  The prevalent institutions were established and designed in times  when linear economy concepts dominated the discourse. Termeer and  Metze  noted that currently institutions constrain circular  choices. Ghahari et al.  explored relationship between in- vestments and performance using regional  US data.  Regional expenditure does not always reflect the actual work performed  on infrastructure improvements because it does not account for wastage,  management, and operational inefficiencies, and corruption. By car- rying out a comparison between eco-cycle and circular economy policies L. Dagilien le et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 3in Sweden, Johansson and Henriksson  also noted that the state is  represented rather as an inherent obstacle than as a facilitator to other  actors. Based on the functional institutional approach, public in- stitutions seek to perform their function of fulfilling efficient contracting  . Local governments are formal institutions responsible  for municipal waste management. However, such an approach does not  explain the needs, evolution, and change of a specific institution nor  does it reveal much about how institutions interact.  A literature review discovers a distinct discourse towards so-called  circular cities. Levoso et al.  explored how urban systems iden- tify their circularity potential and use it to develop a plan for the  implementation of circular strategies. Given the dependency of urban  areas on energy, water, and material resources, cities will only heighten  the issues brought by the linear economy if a paradigm change is not  enforced . It is worth mentioning the study by Pre- ndeville et al.  , which explored how Dutch cities adopt the cir- cular economy as a strategy. Although none of the investigated cities has  the appropriate institutional setting to create a circular economy, Pre- ndeville et al.  developed a definition for a circular city,  which “is a city that practices principles to close resource loops, in  partnership with the city’s stakeholders (citizens, community, business  and knowledge stakeholders), to realise its vision of a future-proof city”.  Cramer  questioned how the implementation of the circular  economy actually takes place and evolves over time, using the example  of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. Fratini et al.  explored how  the circular economy is imagined in the academic literature in support of  sustainability transitions in European cities, and how European cities  imagine the circular economy as a knowable object of governance.  Fratini et al.  suggested conceptualising and operationalising the  circular economy through the prism of socio-technical imaginaries,  namely discourse analysis, institutions, representations, and identities.  Cities have quite different translations of the circular economy imagi - nary as their engagement with the circular economy has aligned to  pre-existing political and institutional arrangements (Fratini et al.,  2019 ).  Although global policies are necessary to set the goal of transitioning  towards the circular economy, local interventions are crucial to make  the goal a reality . Cities could play a vital role by  managing local transport and waste and water systems and offering lo- cations for low-carbon innovations . Pitkanen et al.   emphasised municipalities ’ commitment and active participation  in fostering green and circular initiatives. In the more local-scale cases,  public sector involvement might work to increase the credibility of the  green business cases. Termeer and Metze  analysed to what extent  and how governments can contribute to transitions or transformative  change, especially since the circular economy inherently conflicts with  norms underlying existing policies and regulations (Kirchherr et al.,  2017 ; Korhonen et al., 2018 ).  Initially, the rise of many non-profit recycling initiatives that served  charitable and community building purposes was cast as a moral duty to  the environment . Gradually, these  small-scale initiatives became primarily the responsibility of larger or- ganisations, due to solid waste management. Finally, at the local level, in  particular in urban centres, small initiatives promoting circular practices  contribute to the renewal of urban centres and the reuse of public places  .  Various sustainability transitions are qualified as too slow, for  example, recycling at such a tempo would be far too slow to achieve a  closed loop. Overall, the circular economy has most often been consid - ered only as an approach to more appropriate waste management  , which is not surprising as recycling is funda - mental to the circular economy . Hence, more  attention should be paid to opportunities for developing a local  dimension of recycling in the circular economy   and greater enforcement and more active public participation in the  shifting of consumption practices . Van den Bergh  suggests distinguishing pragmatic, realistic CE policies (e.  g. deposit-refund system) from imaginative, futurist strategies (e.g. in- crease the intensity of a product ’s lifetime, regulation of advertising).  This paper, in contrary to previous research (Fratini et al., 2019 ;  Prendeville et al., 2018 ; Levoso et al., 2020 ), does not analyse strategies  of circular cities, that is cities, which declared themselves as having  unique strategies to contribute and implement the circular economy. It  takes rather an overarching approach, by taking a series of different  municipalities to deeply understand how they implement desirable cir- cular transitions.  2.2. Theoretical frame for steering circular economy in municipalities  By explaining how municipalities could better serve to facilitate  circular economy implementation, we refer to Voβ et al.’s   steering framework for sustainable development . Following  Blomsma and Brennan  and Hirsch and Levin  , an umbrella  approach is adopted to conceptualise the circular economy. Actually,  there are many widespread umbrella concepts, such as zero waste,  resource efficiency, bioeconomy, sustainable consumption and produc - tion, and green economy. Both the circular economy and sustainable  development might be treated as umbrella concepts, used loosely to  encompass and account for a set of diverse phenomena (Hirsch and  Levin, 1999 ). Following Voβ et al.’s  framework, we adapt  ambivalence, uncertainty, and distributed power for explaining and  steering the circular implementation from municipalities ’ point of view.  Ambivalence. The concept of the circular economy is affected by its  inherent subjectivity, particularly when it comes to implementation.  Different actors value and frame reality differently, hence trade-offs  between diverse goals, which are generally accepted as legitimate,  occur. One example can be related with the usage of more recyclable  materials and prolonging a product ’s lifecycle. For example, if one uses  more regenerated-recycled cotton in manufacturing, the products ’  quality may be less and would last a shorter period of time.  In addition, often these goals remain vague in terms of focus,  quantification, and timescale . When it comes to waste  management, which is historically mature ,  the European Commission has set common EU targets for recycling  municipal waste of 65% by 2030 and for recycling packaging waste of  75% by 2030. Such measurable targets decrease the ambivalence;  however, other areas of implementing the circular economy are lacking  clear outcomes, for example implementing eco-design and circular  cooperation. Moreover, local government managers, who focus their  efforts only on fulfilling policymaking for the central government, may  be doing so solely for tokenistic purposes .  Local governments need to realise the potential of inclusive decision  processes by being open to public input, and considering a variety of  viewpoints enables decisions based on local knowledge (Knickmeyer,  2020 ).  Uncertainty. In line with uncertainty about how to interpret the  circular economy , there is no full agreement on  what its precise objective should be (Van den Bergh, 2020 ; Korhonen  et al., 2018 ). A special aspect of the circular economy problems is that  they contain interactions between very different elements from the do- mains of society, technology, and the environment .  Moreover, the engineering and natural science orientated studies  constitute the biggest body of knowledge behind the circular economy  and have been developed in isolation from strategic, management, and  organisational studies. Governmental decisions are extremely important  in implementing circular solutions, as engineering aspects and techno - logical barriers usually do not stop the circular economy transition  . One way to reduce uncertainty about the cir- cular economy is raising social awareness. The movement in this area  has been well supported by the public institutions and educational  programs, and public campaigns as well as seminars have increased  significantly during the last few years . L. Dagilien le et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 4Distributed Power. The linear and the circular economy differ in  individual decisions; actions related to reusing, recycling, and remanu - facturing; and a structured and systemic approach carried out in a  regulated manner at the EU . The national goals for the  circular economy are decentralised across countries. Although each  country has its own targets ,  the achievement of goals is distributed across the country. Eventually,  regions and municipalities should embed circularity targets into their  strategic plans and agendas. Research on the circular economy empha - sises the need for systemic transformations  that  cover in-depth, system-wide, and quick changes simultaneously, which  is virtually impossible because of the inherent trade-offs between them.  There are positive societal environmental shifts  as  in-depth change requires people to break through their routines, learn  about new modes of behaviour, and challenge existing cultures (Ter- meer and Metze, 2019 ). Through networking, local governments seek to  better meet their service responsibilities, being underpinned with a  “logic of consequences ” . Collaborations  across institutions also lead to more effective service delivery (Osei-Kojo  et al., 2020 ) and diminish the effect of distributed power.  To sum up, municipalities are commonly ambivalent about goals,  knowledge of the circular economy is often uncertain, and the power  reflected in related responses is often widely decentralised.  3.Lithuanian local governance case  The EU is confronted with a double challenge for policymaking:  supporting the laggards to catch up, and challenging the frontrunners to  make next steps to fully close the loops and move towards shorter loop  R-imperatives . Importantly, Lithuania has been  considered as a modest performer of the circular economy. Lithuania ’s  performance in the three major circular areas related to Eco innovation  indexes covered is lacklustre, with all three ranking in the bottom half of  EU member states .  Lithuania is a small open economy with 2.8 million inhabitants  which became a member of the EU in 2004. Based on Eurostat data, in Lithuania GDP per capita in 2019 is 17,385 euro or 84% of EU 28.  Lithuania belongs to the group of high human development countries  . Intra-EU trade accounts for 59% of Lithuania ’s exports  , while outside the EU 14%  goes to Russia and 5% to the United States. In terms of imports, 69%  come from EU Member States (Germany 12%, Poland 11%, and Latvia  7%), while outside the EU 15% comes from Russia and 3% from China.  Based on Eurostat data, the services sector contributes 60.3% to the  GDP and employs 68% of the active population. The most important  sectors of Lithuania ’s economy are wholesale and retail trade, transport,  accommodation and food services, information technology, and com- munications sectors. Tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors. The  industrial sector contributes 25.5% to the GDP and employs around 25%  of the active population. The main industrial sectors are electronics,  chemical products, machine tools, metal processing, construction ma- terial, household appliances, food processing, light industry (including  textile), and furniture. The country is also developing oil refineries and  shipyards. The manufacturing sector alone contributes to 17% of the  country ’s GDP. Agriculture contributes 2.9% to the GDP and employs  8% of the workforce.  There are 10 counties that differ by area and population , 10  regional waste management centres , and 60 municipalities,  which are the main administrative-territorial units. Sixty-seven percent  of Lithuania ’s population live in urban areas.  Municipal waste management in Lithuania follows a European  pattern of outsourcing or externalisation as a third-generation policy  area . Local public –private partnerships are rare, as the  municipalities have rather contracted out or kept the provision of ser- vices in-house or through fully  owned companies (e.g.  RATC). The public municipal waste management services are quite well  developed: in 2018, these services covered 99.42% of all inhabitants and  99.47% of economic entities. Local public service delivery networks are  constituted by multi-stakeholders, ranging from waste carriers and  waste recyclers in the local community to those at the regional (RATC,  incineration plants) and national levels.  In 2018, 1142 thousand tons of municipal waste was collected in  Fig. 1.Theoretical frame for steering circular economy implementation .   Fig. 2.Descriptive statistics of Lithuanian counties .  L. Dagilien le et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 5Lithuania. More than half of all municipal waste  was collected in  the three most populous and economically active regions. Naturally,  urban regions generate more municipal waste than rural ones. Lith- uania ’s overall municipal waste per capita  indicator seeks 407  kg/per capita, that is, lower than the EU  average (489 kg/per  capita), implying that, on average, the regional consumption is less than  average in the EU and therefore generates less waste.  The collection of municipal waste is based on a container system  . In 2018, 8.5% of municipal waste was delivered to large-scale  waste collection sites and 8.23% through complementary systems. The  rest of the municipal waste was collected by bypassing and other means.  The overall recycled municipal waste compared to municipal waste  generated  indicator was 56.67% and was higher than the  average of the EU . Of that number, more than 30% of waste was  composted , and only 24.25% was recycled  . The highest recycling rate was seen in recycling  packages of glass , paper and paperboard , metal  , and PET from deposit systems . The lower recycling rate  was seen in various other type of plastic  and  textile waste. Even though mostly all municipalities cross the 55%  recycling rate , recycling indicators should be  treated with caution. Municipal waste still largely ended at landfills,  even in regions where significant investments were made in RATC for  mechanical-biological treatment, that is, about 25% of all municipal  waste was disposed of in landfills, and about 12.52% incinerated. In 2018, 65% of all collected municipal waste was mixed municipal  waste, an average of 266 kg per capita generated. In addition, 48.10% of  all mixed municipal waste was biodegradable waste , which  consisted of textile waste , wastepaper and paperboard ,  green waste , and other waste. Unfortunately, 13.31% of all  mixed municipal waste still consisted of various types of packaging  waste, glass waste , metal waste , and electrical and  electronic equipment . Therefore, the role of primary waste  sorting is very important, as 47.22% of waste could not fall into the  overall mixed municipal waste flow.  4.Research methods  The research presents an inductive access and interpretive perspec - tive based on the Lithuania local governance case. Table 1 presents a  summary of applied research methods.  To deeply understand the main challenges of the circular economy,  focus group discussions and interviews have been carried out. A focus  group  is focused on a specific discussion which  takes place in a semi-structured conversation and in an informal setting.  A semi-structured interview is used to reveal the depth of insights about  circular economy implementation in municipalities. It is important to  note that focus group discussions were organised for smaller groups and  similar to other municipalities, and interviews were organised for larger  municipalities. The participants were selected according to their  Fig. 3.a. Municipal waste, per capita . Fig. 3b. Recycled municipal waste compared to municipal waste generated, % .   Fig. 4.Mixed municipal waste composition, % .  L. Dagilien le et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 6relevance to the topic or their own willingness to participate in the  discussion. The research involved three focus groups, which consisted of  five to six municipalities ’ members. This number corresponds to the optimal size of the focus group and is suitable for further data analysis.  Also, it was organised with three interviews with representatives of  larger municipalities and three interviews with representatives of RATC.  Out of the total of 31 participants , most of them work in a  position directly related to environmental issues.  Finally, by applying web-scan research, good practices leading to  fostering the circular urban initiative have been identified.  5.Main results: drivers, gaps, and key stakeholders  Based on the results of focus groups, interviews, discussions among  researchers, and following Lee  , open codes, grouped into three  axial codes, namely drivers , gaps, and key stakeholders in the circular  value chain, have been identified .  The main gaps related to the implementation of the circular economy  cover waste management, textile waste, and local business. Unambig - uously, municipal waste management problems are the most signif - icant and mainly influenced by residents ’ reluctance to sort, lack of  information about sorting, and bulky waste or homeless waste. The cities ’  residents, in particular apartment dwellers, still sort waste poorly, which  results in large quantities of mixed waste. Moreover, the lack of infor- mation about sorting is still a problem in more rural areas, even though  publicity is widely used by municipalities. Homeless waste appeared  also to be an important problem, which signals low environmental  awareness. This problem is more relevant for rural areas as bulky waste  is usually left near the municipal waste collection containers or in the  wilderness along the rivers.  The other challenge stressed by municipalities is increases of textile  waste, which are influenced by insufficient textile collection infrastructure  and lack of information . The current textile collection infrastructure is not  provided properly, as containers fill up quickly or are far from the res- idents. However, this problem may be potentially temporary as munic - ipalities must implement a textile containers system by 2025. On the  other hand, residents are constantly stockpiling textiles that were not  previously gathered. The other reason for increasing textile waste is the  lack of information because for residents it is important to know what is  going on with the textiles that are being collected.  Finally, municipalities weakly cooperate with local business because  historically this cooperation was not regulated by laws. Moreover, local  business has been identified more as an obstacle. One of these aspects  concerns insufficient business environmental responsibility because  industrial waste is mixed with municipal waste, particularly in smaller  municipalities. The other aspect is the problem of waste from illegal  businesses . If it were possible to  identify the main waste carriers and propose specialised waste collection  methods , this problem would be  solved. Furthermore, information and education about the potential  opportunities and benefits of legalising a business should be useful too.  It is also important to emphasise the activities of other economic entities  such as farmers (collection of hay films on farmers ’ farms and storage of  agricultural machinery tires) and tire manufacturers and importers who Table 1  Summary of used research methods.

Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 7deal with the specifics of certain waste management. There are significantly  too many tires to be disposed of, which become homeless waste; man- ufacturers and importers are not obliged to keep separate accounts for  agricultural tires and double their handling costs, and instead of  organising the management of these large tires, some manufacturers and  importers choose a waste manager, which handles a corresponding  quantity of truck and passenger car tires and benefits from a tax. Also,  there is the problem of using a waste management accounting system   .  All representatives of municipalities and RATC stressed that they  communicate with local residents through various types of communica - tion on a regional waste management level. Cooperation with academia   is  quite highly developed through participation in lectures, ecological  projects, educational sessions, and events. However, the most prob- lematic cooperation is with local business because it is based on the  principles of control: for example, “municipality takes prevention —warns  the company about their industrial waste ”; “increases the control of waste  from manufacturing companies ”; or there is no dialogue with local busi- nesses at all. The local cooperation difficulties arise because business  companies have their own contracts with waste managers. On the other  hand, some cooperation is observed in individual municipalities (for  example, Entrepreneurs Association). RATC usually act as in- termediaries among residents, waste collectors and recyclers, incinera - tion plants, and landfilling.  Additionally, an important problem appeared to be the distribution  of human resources at local governance . Apparently, in smaller mu- nicipalities only one person is assigned to be responsible for environ - mental activities, including the circular economy. Meanwhile, in larger  municipalities, different departments are responsible for one or two  activities, often not related to the circular economy. Local governments  should collaborate more, involving as many other stakeholders as  possible. In the case of households, the municipality ’s collaboration is  highly regulated by contracts and rules , including activities of  municipal waste collection and recycling (with households, RATC, waste  management companies, waste carriers) and reuse  and repair  . In the case of  businesses, the municipality ’s relations are significantly less regulated  by contracts and rules, except for municipal waste collection and partial  recycling. In other circular value chain parts (like secondary raw ma- terials, design, reuse, repair) the municipality ’s relations with other  stakeholders are of recommendatory nature.  Drivers related to the circular economy mainly include society ’s  education, publicity, provision of infrastructure, and initiatives. Pub- licity or provision of information to the society appeared to be the  most common role taken by municipalities. The ways of publicity are  very similar, followed by regulative and mimetic reasons. For example,  “print articles in the local press ”; “information on sorting is provided on the websites of the municipality and RATC ”; “organised shows on cable TV,  radio, radio quizzes ”; “cooperation with schools, kindergartens, lectures,  participation in ecological projects and events of educational institutions ”;  “after the installation of underground sites, public events were organised to  present the new infrastructure ”; and “leaflets, booklets ”. RATC also  communicate about their activities by emphasising the importance of  primary sorting through the media, radio, newspapers, and social media.  The other obligatory function which municipalities fulfil is non-  formal education , which is mostly orientated towards changing  households ’ waste sorting behaviour (“creative society is encouraged ”;  “rangers at containers teach residents how to sort”; “municipality makes  actions when once a year  they pass through  towns and tell how to sort”), preventive supervision (“prevention is taken  by warning companies that may mix industrial waste with municipal waste ”;  “municipalities organise and allocate funds for the implementation of tenders  for nature protection projects ”), and collaborative initiatives for society  (“actions with the community such as “do” action; involve children ”;  “businesses operating on the principles of circular economy, which share their  experience ”).  Municipalities ’ infrastructure facilitates the implementation of the  circular economy with the obvious focus on waste collection and sorting  (“battery collection system is well developed ”; “solving the sorting problem  by implementing recessed systems with ‘chips ’ (counting the number of times  sorting containers have been used) ”; “invests in innovations, equipment that  could improve the sorting of municipal waste. Initially, the municipality  conducts a pilot in one urban district by purchasing equipment (e.g. animal  waste containers) and monitors the usage by households, their awareness. In  this way, it is decided whether it is worth investing, because it is a lot of  money ”). RATC also provide an infrastructure for sharing things for  reuse purposes, which they promote by publicising it. Overall, the ob- tained results are not surprising, as the identified activities are directly  related to the key functions of the municipalities, for example, municipal  waste collection.  6.Discussion: steering solutions  Following our theoretical model, the research results confirm that  municipalities identify the circular economy mostly as waste manage - ment and seek to contribute as much as defined by the legal framework.  Hence, knowledge about the circular economy is uncertain (Voβ et al.,  2007 ), and this hinders the implementation of the circular economy on a  wider scale. Historical functions of municipalities, that is, waste col- lecting and waste recycling, limit implementation of circular solutions  .  In line with Johansson and Henriksson ’s  study about circu- larity shifts in Swedish environmental policy, an identified problem is  also the lock-in of legislation in the linear economy. For example, ac- cording to the legal acts, RATC cannot deliver waste directly to Table 3  Summary of results.

Dagilien le et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 8industrial companies because legally waste is not treated as a product.  Therefore, they sell or deliver waste only to waste recyclers, incinera - tion, or landfills. So, ambivalence of goals complicates the imple - mentation of the circular economy at the local level. Therefore, the  development of local, national, and international coherent environ - mental policies is a critical initiator through making circular options  more viable, creating new funding opportunities, or setting targets for  future development .  According to the conceptual framework, we argue that there are five  types of solutions for circular economy implementation: regulation,  shared vision, learning , negotiation in networks, and re- flexive governance .  The learning solutions (which are related to the society ’s education  and publicity) are the most popular in relation to the circular economy.  Various publications were prepared and published on websites to  inform residents (for example, information leaflet “Waste path from  container to recycling ”; booklet on sorting for school children ; waste ency- clopaedia; waste management memo ). In addition, in the media of the  region , residents were constantly informed about the development of  the waste management systems, innovations, and relevance (e.g. radio  series on the environmental theme in “green channel ” and the ecology sec- tion; computer games about waste sorting; films for children about waste  sorting; electronic map of sorting containers ). RATC together with munic - ipalities encourage residents to participate in various competitions and  projects (national project “We sort”; regional waste sorting competitions or  competition “Stop using —come up with how to re-use! “). Organised ex- cursions to the regional waste landfill, lectures, and seminars on the  environmentally friendly method of extraction and the importance of  waste sorting and consultation seminars on the promotion of respon - sible consumption culture and ecological behaviour in associations and  municipalities also contribute to the provision of the educational  function.  The negotiation in networks could be ensured by building  networking (municipalities are starting to cooperate with the associa - tions for initial discussions about the circular economy) and infra - structure enhancing sharing , for example, RATC together with  municipalities organised the bypasses for the collection of bulky waste,  including electronic waste, and organised the collection of unnecessary  books to landfills. Furthermore, the storage points have been set up at  existing bulky waste collection points where unnecessary items can be  shared .  The shared visions (which are related to the different initiatives,  mostly sharing activities) are one of the least active activities in relation  to the circular economy. Because of the compulsory environmental re- quirements, a product waste collection campaign is organised in all  RATC, whereas some types of waste are collected free of charge from  residents, institutions, and organisations. The campaign “Received  compost free of charge ” was carried out for all residents (for the  delivered complete device, electrical and electronic equipment; not  less than 20 kg, the resident is given 0.5 m3 of green waste compost free  of charge).  Because of the compulsory environmental requirements, solutions  related to the regulation and reflexive governance are mostly oriented  to waste management.  In addition, we also reviewed circular solutions from municipalities  of other countries. It is noticeable that the trend is the opposite. The  dominated good practices are related to the shared visions . These  shared visions are expressed by various types of sharing platforms. For  example, in “Living Lab” the environment works as an innovation  platform, an urban laboratory, where new solutions can be developed  and tested 1; a peer rental service for parking spaces, where its  owners can rent their spaces to others when they do not need them  1; free rental platform of Slovenian designed clothing 1; in Seoul there is the tradition where people share food with  neighbours, borrow and lend tools and equipment or other goods with  others, and exchange labour at harvest time1; the Seoul government also  supports  new start-up businesses and larger corporate companies to  increase their sharing services (including the provision of co-working  space that is municipality-owned),1  car and bike sharing programs,   children ’s clothes and toy sharing project,  sharing of public  community centres.1 They also consider circular solutions by promoting  initiatives related to the local production, repair, and re-use initiatives  such as Repair Caf˘e, where the idea is to have experts in different pro- fessions  and volunteers available  once a month to help repair and refurbish products 1; reuse  and repair activities; cooperative supermarkets and food waste recovery  initiatives promote responsible consumption and help to develop local  activities and production in Paris.1 It is noticeable that the other  important group of solutions for circular economy implementation by  municipalities is learning . In other countries, solutions related to  learning or education are expressed by organising trainings/seminars/  lectures for changing experience, knowledge, and skills (in such cities1  as Amsterdam, Brussels, Glasgow, London, Kristiansand, etc.). In other  countries, solutions related to the negotiation networks are expressed  by creating the centres for citizens and business cooperation (in such  cities1 as Amsterdam, Brussels, Glasgow, London, Kristiansand, etc.) and  by the improvement of infrastructure for circular solutions, for example,  transform fly ash from incineration plants to building materials,  including road construction 1; when re-surfacing asphalt  roads, the waste products, millings and chippings, are then reused in  construction/renovation of streets and sidewalks, as added volume for  banks in the unbound bearing layers, and/or for the sub-base layer  1; and old bus seats are used for children ’s playground  equipment .1 The solutions for circular economy imple - mentation related to the regulation and reflexive governance are less  popular among municipalities. Regulation is expressed by allocation of  financial and non-financial instruments , for example, in Ljubljana  farmers who sell directly to restaurants and hotels are supported from  the City Tourism Office1; in London, finances are provided to help fund  circular economy businesses1; in New York there is government-funded  research on material reuse1 and intensive organic farming is supported  .1 Reflexive governance is expressed by integration of the cir- cular economy principles into public procurement processes in such  cities as Berlin, Paris, Toronto, and Basel. Furthermore, the supple - mentation of municipal environmental policies and plans in such city as  Brussels becomes important as a reflexive governance solution.  It is noticeable that when analysing the actions of other countries for  the circular economy, there are various solutions which involve more  stakeholders (for example, municipality-resident; municipality-busi - ness; municipality-business-resident, etc.). According to Knickmeyer   the leadership of local governments can be improved through  reliability , legitimacy (punitive  measures), and effectiveness (dissemination of information about the  program benefits). However, the current activities that promote circular  economy implementation at the Lithuanian local governance level are  quite fragmented  and  oriented mostly to compliance with environmental requirements and  laws. The circular economy also emphasises eco-design initiatives and  attempts to keep the product in the market by reusing, re-sharing, and  remanufacturing. Although the state is given the role of supporting  market initiatives through soft initiatives, this is still in the very initial   stage, for example, creating sharing platforms for  used goods or support by developing a local dimension of recycling. Our  results are in line with Johansson and Henriksson  , that the re- sponsibility for establishing circularity is left to the market, in the form  of consumers-individuals and companies-entrepreneurs. Therefore, the  role of local governments should be more proactive and strengthening  across the circular value chain. The complexity and multi-sectoral na- ture of the circular economy call for multi-level and multi-governance 1 https://www.c40.org/researches/municipality-led-circular-economy . L. Dagilien le et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of Cleaner Production 310  127340 9approaches  and rethinking of conventional  regional economic development policies.  Implications for academia . We clarified the interactions between the  circular economy and local governance which appeared to be scant in  the scientific literature. Importantly, we adapted Voβ et al.’s   steering framework for sustainable development to facilitate the  implementation of the circular economy by local governance.  Implications for local governments . We identified challenges for  implementing the circular economy within the lack of municipalities ’  and RATC contributions. We created a practical framework of circular  solutions for local governments by mapping national and foreign prac- tices through five perspectives, namely learning, sharing vision, reflex - ive governance, regulation, and negotiation in networks. Our proposed  steering solutions could be implemented beyond the Lithuanian case.  To support transition to the circular economy, local governments  should more focus on smart waste management, which systemically  contains automatisation of waste segregation, collection, and route  optimisation, as well as digital apps for creating communication, eco-  innovations related to waste management schemes and policies. To  support local governments in implementing smart waste management,  one way is to apply digital solutions such as introducing electronic  sensors and gradually automating materials and processes. To achieve  higher waste sorting levels resulting in higher levels of recycling, edu- cation and social innovations raising social awareness is a long-term  important tool. Specifically, Lithuanian municipalities are going to  commit to responsibilities regarding food waste separation from the  municipal waste stream. As regards the reduction of large amounts of  textile waste, encompassing national strategy for circular textile should  be created with clear action plans for textile waste sorting and recycling  and initial discussions with local business about expanded producers ’  responsibility schemes. Finally, it is important to mention not to be  trapped within the recycling economy, losing opportunities to advance  towards innovative features of the circular economy, such as product design, renewability, integration of patterns, and collaborative pro- duction systems.  Implications for society . This research also aims to raise local gov- ernments ’ awareness about the circular economy, which goes beyond  just waste management, and also includes prevention and active  collaboration with business and local communities. In particular, this  research tries to understand the changing role of municipalities from just  functional implementation to wider networking across the circular value  chain.  7.Conclusions  The current role of local governments is based just on functional  waste management and still lacks a wider networking across the circular  value chain. In the context of the circular economy, development of  human resources together with a learning society are highly important.  From our research, it is highly evident that those circular economy  solutions, which are not regulated, are very weakly implemented by  local governance. Current solutions are mostly orientated to waste  management. Learning  is the most developed by local  governance, while steering solutions of sharing a vision, reflexive  governance, regulation, and negotiation in networks are at the initial  stage.  We identified the trade-off between large volumes of communica - tions  and lack of information about waste  travelling across the value chain and a still developing culture of  municipal waste sorting. It should be noted that some streams of waste  have high sorting rates, for example, PET bottles packaging collected by  the deposit system. Sorting of municipal waste by residents is still a  problem, although huge investments have been assigned for waste  sorting infrastructure and communication tools. Green procurement is  also weakly developed. All solutions should move from just waste  management orientation to a wider implementation of the circular  Fig. 5.Summary of solutions for circular economy implementation at local governance.  L. Dagilien le et al.

Despite the fact that the research was carried out only in Lithuania,  the results might be compared with other countries, taking into account  national contexts. Research results might be useful for seeing certain  trends and providing further recommendations. The similarities and  differences might be identified between common EU and national  trends, especially for modest countries, regarding the circular economy  implementation.  Future research. At the research moment, municipalities were in a  transition period of preparing new strategic development plans for  2021 –2027; therefore, the detailed documents ’ content analysis on  strategic plans and relationship with operational level would be valu- able. Particularly, it is important to explore how key performance in- dicators included in the strategic plans are being integrated within  municipality ’s internal accounting systems or how municipalities do  integrate energy and water usage, materials, and food waste measure - ment at local governance level. Thus, our study suggests that more  research is needed into the more critical aspects of implementing cir- cular economy strategies by local governance, in terms of environmental  rebound effects, regulatory impacts, effects of digital solutions, and  development of environmental performance measurement systems.
