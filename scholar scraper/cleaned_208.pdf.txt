INFO Keywords Circular economy Food waste management Biorefinery Sustainability Waste reduction Food redistribution ABSTRACT Circular Economy CE aims to retain the maximum value of products and materials for a longer time in a closed loop manner thereby decoupling natural resource usage from economic growth Food waste reduction is one of the top priorities under the recent European Union s CE Package It also contributes to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDG While food loss and waste FLW prevention and man agement are wellstudied in the literature research in CE is more recent Through a systematic literature review this study creates a taxonomy that synthesises the key aspects of FLW under the CE papers were reviewed and analysed using keyword cooccurrence analysis KCN and structural dimension analysis In KCN three research themes emerge impact assessment biorefinery and nutrient recycling Structural dimension analysis reveals the types of research methods types of FLW flows FLW prevention and management options with associated opportunities and challenges and the sustainability impact assessment SIA addressed in the liter ature A taxonomy is presented and future research directions are highlighted under six research streams i FLW supply and quantification ii practices and technological aspects iii logistics and supply chain management iv market demand v SIA and vi policy and legislation Combining insights from CE and FLW prevention and management the taxonomy helps key stakeholders including industry practitioners to grasp new business op portunities politicians to set up support strategies and strategic development plans society to recognise the benefits of wasteoriented bioeconomy and consumers to raise their awareness and be actively involved in CE Introduction A third of the annual food produced for human consumption roughly billion tons is either wasted or lost along the food supply chain FSC FAO Food loss and waste FLW accounts for of freshwater use of total global cropland area of global fertiliser use Kummu et al and about Gtonnes of CO equivalent of total greenhouse gas GHG emissions FAO Halving the amount of FLW could contribute to reducing GHG emission from food production by Bajzelj et al While about of the world population nearly million is undernourished FAO et al and by billion people will need to be adequately fed United Nations wasting foods represents a contemporary economic environmental social and ethical challenge on a global scale which requires urgent political attention FAO Teigiserova et al One of the novel efforts in preventing and managing FLW is the adoption of the circular economy CE concept that has been supported in the EU political agenda European Commission FLW prevention is identified as the top priority and an integral part of an EU Action Plan for its transition towards the CE The CE Action Plan not only puts forward a series of actions to promote more sus tainable production and consumption behaviours and patterns in EU food system eg food donation and labelling awareness but also fosters the adoption of biotechnologies and practices to convert FLW into a variety of valuable biobased products for longterm socioeconomic and environmental benefits Maina et al Zabaniotou and Kamaterou In the Action Plan a common EU methodology for FLW quanti fication is also proposed to ensure the consistent quantification moni toring and analysis of FLW statistics These measures support the EU on its trajectory towards meeting the United Nations Sustainable Corresponding author Email address NQDohullacuk Q Do Contents lists available at ScienceDirect International Journal of Production Economics uzkw syokr oow otomywm kotuo  Received March Received in revised form June Accepted June International Journal of Production Economics Development Goal SDG to by halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along pro duction and supply chains including postharvest losses Flanagan et al As the instrumental role in the transition towards the CE FLW has gained momentum in the CErelated academic discourse with expo nential growth in related publications over the last five years Kyr iakopoulos et al To better position our study and highlight our contribution to this significant and everincreasing published research base we have examined a considerable amount of extant literature that deals with FLW in the CE Appendix presents a summary of these studies providing authors names year of publication the number of articles reviewed and main focuses in term of stages of the supply chain waste prevention and management options and the considered evalu ation criteria The earliest was published in This extensive list is grouped into seven focused topic areas i FLW conversion technologies ii biorefinery models iii life cycle assessment LCA methods for FLW prevention and management routes iv methods for quantifying the FLW flows v FLWrelated policies vi the FLW hierarchy framework vii FLW prevention behaviours The difference between the first two topics lies in the cascading concept where the former focuses on a specific technology while the latter aims at a combination of multiple technologies for a plethora of outputs Although the prior literature re views represent the crucial starting point for our study two limitations are identified First their focus is constrained to a specific topic area predominantly focused on technological feasibility in a fragmented manner Since FLW in the CE thinking is a complex and multifaceted issue that cannot be attributed to a single variable Schanes et al Kyriakopoulos et al a singular or micro perspective is not recommended Otherwise the CE discourse is simply a refurbished notion of the triple R principle reduce reuse recycle where a single solution is chosen according to the environmental criteria Crist obal et al a b Ingrao et al while economic and social evaluations as well as the optimal cascade of individual bioprocesses for the authentic transformation of the linear to the circular economy Dahiya et al are completely neglected Second the review protocol in many cases is not illustrated As such most papers either do not mention the number of reviewed articles or review a limited set of articles with unclear selection criteria This narrative method of syn thesising previous studies is criticised as being devoid of replicability transparency and thoroughness and thus can be biased by the re searchers in making sense of extant literature Tranfield et al We therefore attempt to overcome these limitations As shown in Appendix our scope includes the abovementioned topic areas in order to provide a comprehensive literature review We considered articles published in all areas of focus and all stages of the supply chain irrespective of the chosen FLW prevention and man agement options that are linked to the CE and FLW We have chosen a systematic literature review SLR method over other review approaches because of its replicable and transparent process which contributes to giving a balanced and unbiased result Tranfield et al The main objectives of this extensive review are threefold i to offer an analytical overview of existing research relying on bibliometric tools such as keyword cooccurrence analysis ii to carry out the structural dimen sion analysis on research methodology FLW types FLW prevention and management options with the associated opportunities and challenges and sustainability assessment indicators iii to derive a taxonomy framework for the classification of the critical aspects of the reviewed papers and offer potential future research avenues After the introduction the paper proceeds as follows Theoretical background Section sheds light on the FLW definitional scoping concept of CE and its relevant principles in FLW prevention and man agement The SLR methodology is presented in Section which is fol lowed by a keyword cooccurrence network analysis to identify emerging research themes Section and structural dimension analysis to critically appraise different relevant dimensions Section The discussion Section encapsulates current research lines and proposes the research agenda The conclusions and limitations of this study are presented in Section Theoretical background FLW definitional scoping a review boundary Clearly stating the boundaries of the topic is essential when per forming a SLR This is of great importance due to a lack of consensus with reference to a precise definition of food loss and waste resulting in an interchangeable use of the concepts of loss and waste FAO The existence of multiple FLW definitions complicates the data collec tion and comparability of FLW levels Corrado and Sala chal lenges the measure of the distance towards the SDG target Teigiserova et al and hampers the analysis of FLW FAO FLW definitions are different in two major aspects the types of wastes edible and inedible parts of foods and the boundaries in the FSC to be included Corrado and Sala For instance FAO p define FLW as the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply chain but distinguish food loss from food waste based on the stages of the FSC Food loss refers to the amount of the edible parts of crops livestock and fish leaving the upper part of the FSC from the postharvesting slaughtering and catching stage up to but not including the retail stage by being discarded or disposed of or incinerated FAO These stages typically consist of storage transportation pro cessing and importing activities Food waste arises at the downstream stages from retail to the consumption points Of note the FLW s scope under the FAO s conceptual framework excludes not only inedible parts of foods but also the edible foods that are destined to an economically productive nonfood use such as animal feeds or industrial use FU SIONS on the other hand does include both edible and inedible parts of foods in its proposed FLW definition but it does not distinguish food loss and food waste FUSIONS p defined food waste as foods that are removed from lost to or diverted from the food supply chain and flow into nine destinations FUSIONS also highlighted the difference between food surplus and food waste Although food sur plus is still a part of FSC and fit for human consumption it would end up as waste if no prevention or reuse is carried out As a result prevention and redistribution to humans are only applicable to food surplus Ng et al While the paper acknowledges differences between various concepts the scope of FLW terminology used hereinafter in this review paper will encompass food losses food wastes edible and inedible portions of food loss and wastes as well as food surplus that arise from all stages of the FSC Circular economy concept A circular economy is defined as an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design Ellen MacArthur Foundation p According to Bocken et al the CE includes strategies for closing slowing or narrowing resource loops Closing completes a resource circle by connecting the postuse of a resource with the pro duction stage via recycling while slowing loops reduces the speed of resource flow by extending the inuse period with longlife design andor maintenance repairs remanufacturing services Finally nar rowing the loop means lowering resources embedded in each product The CE concept cannot be traced back to any particular authors or dates but is rather considered as the synthesis of various schools of thought prominently cradletocradle philosophy performance econ omy blue economy biomimicry and industrial ecology Ghisellini et al Geissdoerfer et al Merli et al The cradletocradle philosophy fosters the superior design of products for For example shells peels bones pulps husks leaves pomaces Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics longer use continuous recovery and reutilisation McDonough and Braungart This philosophy regards all materials made of two distinct types of nutrients technical and biological Food is classified as consumable products made of nontoxic and beneficial biological nutri ents that can be safely reintroduced to the biosphere either directly or via a cascade of consecutive use to build natural capital This biological metabolism is in contrast with durable products made of technical nu trients eg polymers alloys that are not suitable for returning safely to the biosphere and should be designed with minimal energy and the highest quality retention Building upon cradletocradle philosophy the CE also drives a shift in the material composition of consumable items from technical towards biological nutrients to make products serving a restorative purpose eg via the use of biodegradable instead of singleuse food packages Building on performance economy the CE focuses on the products performance such as having an extended life cycle and consuming less energy and resources Stahel Adopting the blue economy principles the CE encourages the use of resources in a cascading manner and promotes the use of one persons wastes as re sources for others as well as minimising resource leakage Pauli The cascade principle urges the sequential and consecutive utilisation of resources to maximise economic returns For instance food waste is used to extract bioactive compounds first before the residues of this process are used for lower value energy and composting production Stimulated by biomimicry the CE aims at emulating a natural selfsustaining ecosystem where the movement of biomaterials follows a continuous circular flow without wastes Benyus Take a tree as an example The dead leaves are decomposed into minerals to be absorbed by the tree to generate new leaves circularly Ideally our food system can be designed following this natural regenerative mechanism Essential nutrients eg nitrogen and phosphorous that have been taken by plants and animals can be fed back into the environment Inspired by industrial ecology the CE supports the establishment of the industrial symbiosis concept which involves the mutually beneficial exchanges of materials energy water and wastes between parties with geographic proximity to design out waste Graedel and Allenby Circular economy principles in FLW prevention and management The essence of the CE provided in section can be translated into FLW prevention and management following six principles outlined below i Circling longer principle To keep foods in use longer by extending their shelflife and redistributing surplus foods for human consumption which contributes to lowering the amount of FLW generated inspired by the cradletocradle philosophy and performance economy ii Cascading principle To maximise economic value extracted from all substances of FLW in a cascaded manner following the biomass value pyramid rather than converting all food waste products into lowvalue energy generation inspired by the blue economy iii Regenerative principle To reintroduce the biological nutrients back into the soil promote the generation of renewable energy from FLW to reduce intake of virgin materials and ideally erad icate resource leakage associated with incineration and landfills inspired by biomimicry iv Inner circle principle To promote surplus prevention and surplus reuse followed by recycling and recovery so as to minimise the need for tapping into new materials v Pure circle principle To preserve a certain quality level in FLW collection via separation and to encourage the use of shortlived products made of biobased instead of fossilbased materials eg biodegradable plastics inspired by cradletocradle philosophy vi Industrial symbiosis principle To promote the exchange of FLW as resources at the local scale and regional scale inspired by industrial ecology These underlying principles fundamentally transform FLW preven tion and management under the CE landscape beyond the food waste hierarchy The waste hierarchy built upon the European Waste Framework Directive WFD dated back to the current version in with an amendment in provides an order of preference for actions to reduce and manage waste prevention reuse recycle recovery disposal This preference order is solely based on the overall environmental outcome Although the hierarchy encourages the circling longer prevention and reuse and regenerative principle recycle and recovery of the CE it disregards other principles particularly the cascading principle where economic value is taken into consideration In addition the generic terminologies used in the waste hierarchy are open to different interpretations by users especially when applied to a spe cific industry such as the food sector Teigiserova et al leading to discrepancies in the literature To be consistent during the review process we highlighted these discrepancies Fig and elucidated the meanings for different FLW prevention and management options used in this SLR Our scoping encompasses both prevention and management of FLW where the former is used to avoid food surplus generation while the latter refers to reuse recycle and recovery Reuse hereinafter only includes redistribution to people in the form of donations or food sharing while recycling and recovery aim at converting FLW into a range of valueadded products following the biomass value pyramid However we are aware that a few studies might include the animal feed conversion option in reuse GarciaGarcia et al Teigiserova et al while prevention might consist of reuse eg following the approach of the WRAP House of Commons This might be because both prevention and reuse aim to prevent surplus from turning into wastes Notably some papers such as Teigiserova et al while distinguishing reuse from prevention listed donation as a pre vention initiative Similarly recycle and recovery options might not include the generation of higher value products such as bioactive compounds eg in Papargyropoulou et al or WRAP Finally it is noted that two of the three resource management loops the closing and slowing extending and intensifying resource loops are firmly reflected in the FLW prevention and management The third namely narrowing the loop is more pertinent to the forward food supply chain as it advocates more efficiency of production distribution and consumption activities As such narrowing the loops though equally significant in the CE paradigm falls outside the scope of this paper Research methodology The SLR is a process of a systematic explicit and reproducible design for identifying evaluating and interpreting the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers scholars and practitioners Fink p The SLR enables a rigorous impartial and literaturewide assessment of extant studies outcomes quality and design Following the seminal work for conducting the SLR by Tranfield et al and the content analysisbased literature review method of Seuring and Gold that was built on the work of Mayring we organised our reviews in three phases iMaterial collection which consists of the identification of key words construction of search strings and choice of databases to be investigated ii Material selection and evaluation which are designed to filter the relevant papers known as review sample by applying a series Biomass value pyramid is presented in the paper of Berbel and Posadillo in the descending order of value as follows fine and pharmaceutical products food and feed bulk chemicals biofuels composts elec tricity and heat Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics of inclusionexclusion criteria An initial screening is carried out to observe the distribution of the review sample scientifically chronically and geographically iii Material evaluation which aims at the appraisal of keywords and the relevant structural dimensions A keyword cooccurrence network KCN is a powerful visual isation tool used to discover the research fronts by examining and visualising the links between keywords in the literature Liu and Mei Radhakrishnan et al VOSviewer is chosen to conduct KCN thanks to its straightforward and fast clustering and visualisation capability for a large number of journal articles van Eck and Waltman VOS in VOS viewer stands for visualisation of similarities a mapping technique that is described indepth in the paper of Van Eck and Waltman For clustering capability the Smart Local Moving SLM algorithm is used The detailed mathematical equation of the SLM algorithm is provided in Waltman and van Eck Structural dimension analysis contents of fulltext papers were broken down and coded into four dimensions each dimension is further collapsed into associated analytical categories Table Of note under the dimension of FLW prevention and management options associated opportunities and challenges are coded and presented to further inform this dimension NVIVO software is used for its effectiveness in quickly organ ising and coding a large number of articles in a rigorous and transparent manner in comparison with manual or Excel coding Material collection The choice of keywords was thoroughly discussed and agreed by all authors to locate scientific contributions that fulfilled the paper s ob jectives The keywords were divided into two categories and truncated terms sign were used as recommended in Gimenez and Tachizawa to expand the range of possible studies found Keywords related to FLW topic loss OR waste OR leftover OR surplus OR byproducts AND food OR agri OR agro Keywords related to the Circular Economy topic circular economy OR circular bioeconomy OR industrial symbiosis OR circular OR closedloop OR reduce reuse recycle OR three ROR triple ROR waste hierarchy The keywords were queried on two databases Scopus and Web of Science WoS which are considered the most comprehensive databases of peerreviewed journals that store a broad range of scientific papers Chadegani et al Nobre and Tavares Mokhtar et al Additionally both databases have been used extensively in producing SLR in the field of circular economy Homrich et al Merli et al Trkeli et al Sehnem et al and FLW management Chen et al Ferrazzi et al GorzenMitka et al The merging of two databases is beneficial in order to increase the likelihood of finding all the relevant contributions and to provide a high level of rigour in searching and selecting the papers to be included in the Fig Food waste prevention and management options Terminology review Note Disposal landfill or incineration

search on Scopus returned papers and papers were obtained from WoS Material selection and evaluation Inclusion and exclusion criteria To focus the research on the topic under investigation these papers are then screened in this step by applying a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria i Only select peerreviewed articles written in English o Excluding papers in Scopus and papers in WoS o Including papers in Scopus and papers in WoS ii Duplication removal between two databases Removing overlapping between Scopus and WoS papers keeping papers exclusively found in Scopus and pa pers exclusively found in WoS The result suggested that of publications in Scopus were covered by WoS of WoS records were covered by Scopus Total papers for further review papers in both sources iii Abstract screening focusing on two criteria Food loss food wastes and surplus are the central themes of the analysis Other types of wastes wastewater sludge urban wastes or animal manures wools wood etc that are not related to FLW prevention and management are excluded Plastic wastes are only included if they are linked to the FLW discourse such as the output products bioplastics or their role in reducing FLW Articles that convey the key principles of the circular economy that are aligned with the six principles discussed in Section and related terms closedloop supply chain industrial symbi osis triple R and waste hierarchy Only papers meeting two criteria are selected leaving us with papers iv Fulltext papers are then retrieved and thoroughly reviewed for their relevance with the research objectives o Irrelevant papers papers o Total fulltext papers retained for review papers v All references in the papers in our sample in step iv were checked This led to an addition of papers out of which were found relevant and added to the sample o A final sample size papers This entire selection process is done by three reviewers to remove the selection bias associated with the subjective judgment of the inclusion exclusion process Tranfield et al Initial screening Initial screening aims to observe the historical development the commonly targeted journals for publications and geographical distri bution of the articles in the research topic Prior to studies in this area were scarce The first publication was recorded as early as by Moen who investigated the ecocircularity concept to convert FLW into compost in local areas Five years later Man and Wenhu constructed a theoretical circular agricultural system where FLW like crop straws are utilised to produce fertilisers and energy Zhao et al optimised the circular production for paddy rice fungus fertil isers and biogas considering economic and ecological benefits Li et al underlined the role of earthworms in the CE transition by turning food wastes into feeds fertilisers and input materials for biochemical and pharmaceutical sectors It was not until right after the introduction of the CE Action Plan in Europe in that interest in the FLW and the CE began to take off in academia Fig In term of targeted journals Fig the Journal of Cleaner Pro duction attracted the highest number of publications followed by Bio resource Technology Resource Conservation and Recycling Waste Management Sustainability Renewable and sustainable energy re views These journals combined account for more than of total publications in the review sample Although the FLW topic under the CE landscape can be linked to multiple research fields the topics of the review papers fit well within the scope of these journals which epito mises biotechnological advances and the sustainability paradigm In term of geographical distribution the majority of the articles are linked to European countries particularly Italy and the UK Fig a The USA and China are the only two nonEuropean countries in the top ten countries with the highest number of affiliations It is noted that only papers specified the country where the research took place Fig b and of these studies were carried out in the EU notably in Italy and the UK of the studies are linked to developing countries The popularity of the publications in the EU and China reflects the alignment with increased interest from companies and policymakers in these re gions This finding is also consistent with other CE literature review papers eg in Geissdoerfer et al Keyword cooccurrence analysis KCN treats each keyword as a node and each cooccurrence of a pair of words as a link between those two words Keywords are extracted from Author Keywords and Index Keywords fields in the Scopus and WoS database of the review sample The use of keywords requires the preprocessing step Words that are in structured abstracts eg arti cles industry analysis priority journal were removed Words that offer the same meaning but in different formats are adjusted using a thesaurus file eg anaerobicdigestion and anaerobic digestion by products and byproducts fertiliser and fertilizers The VOSviewers SLM algorithm divided keywords into clusters that determine the relatedness of the keywords this implies that the larger the number of articles in which two terms are both found the stronger the relationship between the terms is If keywords are grouped in the same cluster represented by the same colour in the map Fig they are relatively strongly related to each other and therefore tend to reflect the same topic Each keyword is signified by a circle with the attached la bels and some labels are not visible to avoid overlapping and ease vis ualisation The larger size of the circle reflects the more frequent occurrence of the keyword while the distance between two keywords offers an approximate indication of the relatedness of the keywords In other words keywords with a higher rate of cooccurrence tend to be found closer to each other It should be underlined that the SLM algo rithm allows one keyword to be assigned to one cluster only hence two keywords in different clusters if found close to each other are still strongly related A total of keywords were extracted from Fig Research evolution on the topic of FLW management in the circu lar economy Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics articles of which keywords occurred nine or more times and were retained in the map Fig The setting of the threshold of nine excludes the keywords with low frequencies and thus the network was more concentrated These keywords are divided into three clusters covering three themes i impact assessment ii biorefinery iii nutrient recy cling Keywords with a high number of occurrences greater than are also provided for each cluster Table Cluster impact assessment sustainability LCA economic analysis A close interlink between the CE and sustainability in the food sector has been emphasised in many studies For instance Jurgilevich et al cast light on the integration of the CE concept in the FSC that contributes to promoting sustainable production and consumption and FLW management practices Genovese et al illustrate how the CE pushes the frontiers of sustainability by using a circular FSC waste cooking oil for biodiesel production where materials can be used over and over again and the biosphere is not a sink for residuals Kiss et al demonstrated the linkage between the CE and sustainability in the promotion of short FSCs Resource exchanges at the local scale following the industrial symbiosis principle are increasingly emphasised as the interface between the circular economy and sustainability Imbert This relationship has been quantitatively measured using LCA and economic analysis tools as revealed by the keyword list Table These tools aid the decisionmaking process to determine optimal FLW pre vention and management options considering environmental and eco nomic performance Detailed analysis of how LCA and economic analysis have been applied is presented in Section It is noted that the economic analysis keyword appears in articles in the review sample but many of these articles are experimental studies taking the laboratory process efficiency eg yield as an economic indicator Cluster biorefinery biomass valorisation animal feeds Biorefinery is the cornerstone in the transition from linear to the CE Maina et al Dahiya et al which is aligned with the cascading principle of the CE The biorefinery process synergises mul tiple monoprocesses to produce multiple output products for multiple markets such as food supplements bioplastics cosmetics and pharma ceuticals and biofuels contributing to the diversification of product portfolio and revenue gains de la Caba et al Teigiserova et al Although the biorefinery plant using biomass eg corn or Fig The number of articles per Journal Journals with more than ten publications Fig Geographical distribution of the review sample Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics sugarcane to replace petroleumbased refinery is not a new topic the food versus fuel dilemma has sparked a growing interest in utilising FLWs as alternative feedstocks over the last few years Venkata Mohan et al However the technology remains novel necessitating further investigation into pretreatment technologies hydrolysis or fermentation and the process efficiency enhancement Barampouti et al In this cluster biorefinery is closely associated with valorisation and animal feed production Valorisation refers to the conversion of FLW into highvalue biocompound and animal feed FUSIONS while full valorisation means a cascading biorefinery before energy and soil restoration options Ellen MacArthur Foundation Valorisation receives considerable attention in the review sample ie Mirabella et al Zabaniotou and Kamaterou and is normally appli cable to manage the homogeneity of the waste flows Corrado and Sala p eg byproducts at the processing plants Insectrearing on plantbased FLW such as fruits and vegetables for feed production is also a type of valorisation Barbi et al and this trend marks a shift away from simple thermal foodtofeed conversion Cappellozza et al Conti et al Cluster nutrient recycling anaerobic digestion fertilisers Interest in the standalone decentralised technology like Anaerobic digestion AD is prominent in the review sample AD is a mature technology particularly in Europe with many operational plants Slor ach et al b to recover energy and recycle nutrientrich digestates back to soils Zabaniotou and Kamaterou Battista et al Additionally AD can be deployed on a small scale in any geographical location Ingrao et al which makes it fit well in the industrial symbiosis and regenerative principle of the CE It is estimated that if all bread waste in the UK was fed into AD plants it could generate roughly GWh of the total energy used in the bread sector each year Veldhuis et al Compared to incineration and landfill AD is proven to be an efficient and ecofriendly GHG saving waste treatment option CapsonTojo et al Traditionally revenue from AD plants comes merely from biogas or heatelectricity yield while digestate is classified as waste Following the regenerative principle of CE digestate should be utilised as bio fertilisers and contribute to return nutrients particular P and N to the biosphere Beggio et al to improve soil fertility and promote the growth of maize Chen et al Unfortunately not all countries recognise the legal status of this biofertiliser stream Fuldauer et al Looking at Italy for instance the use of digestates from agrofeedstock is accepted but those from organic Municipal Solid Waste MSW are banned Moreover the statistical analysis study of Beggio et al established that there is no statistically significant differ ence between digestate generated from agrofeedstock and organic MSW There is a call for relegislation to support the commercialisation of ADeffluent Fuldauer et al Fig Keyword

Economics Structural dimension analysis In this section four structural dimensions were statistically and analytically evaluated to reveal the main research streams in the topic of FLW prevention and management under the CE perspective These di mensions are chosen based on two relevant papers in the CE topic Kirchherr et al Merli et al and one paper in the FLW management topic Paes et al Within this highly fragmented research area the reliance on the existing way of analysing literature offers a useful guideline for our analysis Research methods The methods of review sample fall into five types i experiment ii modelling iii literature review iv theoretical and conceptual framework v survey the first three types of which are the most popular Fig The highest number of papers used labscale or pilot studies to demonstrate the feasibility of technological innovations to valorise FLWs or enhance the efficiency of current processes Bosco et al EstebanGuti errez et al Grillo et al Atasoy et al Weber et al or demonstrate the feasibility of selfsustaining FSC model Stoknes et al Positive results from experiments pave the way for the upscaling potentials driving the transition towards the CE The experimental method is followed by modelling Common modelling tools include LCAbased methods material flow analysis MFA economic analysis eg Life Cycle Costing LCC optimisation and simulation The main purposes of modelling papers are to assess the technoeconomic feasibility and environmental impact of different FLW prevention and management options and quantify the flow of the FLW stream A novel MFALCA and agentbased approach to improving nutrient cycle management in agricultural systems is pro posed in FernandezMena et al Literature review papers papers come third with the focus on seven topics that have been pre sented in the introduction and are condensed in Appendix A theoretical and conceptual method is adopted in papers These studies mainly aim at sustainable consumption models to prevent and redistribute food waste generation Mylan et al Hebrok and Heidenstr m Several behaviour theories are employed frame analysis for food donations Tikka the theory of change ToC for food sharing Michelini et al prospect s theory for customers perception of biowaste products Russo et al convention theory for retailer s role in tackling FLW Swaffield et al Some con ceptual frameworks are proposed the sixstep framework for nutrient stock and flow accounting van der Wiel et al a sevenstep framework for integrated LCALCC methodology De Menna et al a framework for MSW collection and recycling Woon and Lo Finally the survey is the least employed method papers with the main aim being to investigate i perception of endusers towards biowastebased products Danso et al AschemannWitzel et al a b McCarthy et al Russo et al Coderoni and Perito ii consumers willingness to participate in the CE pro gram Borrello et al Russo et al iii effectiveness of FLW collection policies and sorting behaviours MiliutePlepiene and Plepys Liikanen et al Andersson and Stage iv prevention attitude and behaviours of households Jereme et al Todorova et al eg Fogarassy et al of airline employees Sambo and Hlengwa and of restaurant owners Lang et al The FLW stream FLW flows in the review sample are grouped into three types i surplus ii homogeneous flow iii heterogeneous flow the last two FLW types attract the largest attention Fig Surplus food represents the edible food that is fit for human consumption while the last two groups remain either natural inedibility or inedibility due to degradation Teigiserova et al This classification comes from the differences in desirable prevention and management strategies for each stream Studies on food surplus are associated with prevention and reuse options while homogeneous FLW flow is commonly linked to valorisation for highvalue compounds Oldfield et al Corrado and Sala Teigiserova et al Heterogeneous flow is most suitable for energy and nutritional recovery ie via AD and composting In addition this classification contributes to overcoming the ongoing debates in inter preting inedible versus edible or unavoidable versus avoidable in extant literature Slorach et al b Relatively equal consideration in the review sample is accorded to heterogeneous and homogeneous flows whereas a much lesser extent is paid to the surplus Food surplus mainly occurs at the retail and consumption stages of the FSC but can arise at manufacturing and agricultural stages due to overproduction Papargyropoulou et al Garrone et al Homogeneous flow normally occurs at the food processing stage and agricultural activities agroresidues Banerjee et al Egelyng et al but it can also be generated in the catering services such as in the case of spent coffee grounds SCG Kourmentza et al or used cooking oils in restaurants CarmonaCabello et al This waste stream is discharged in large quantities with high compositional homogeneity at specific locations Crist obal et al a b of fering abundant and lowcost resources However the underlying challenge with this waste stream comes from seasonality and regional patterns Gontard et al which might pose risks for the yearround operation of the singlefeedstock plant Banerjee et al Conversely the heterogeneous waste stream often stems from supermarkets and households Ng et al and catering services including restaurants hotels hospitals and schools Strazza et al Nizami et al which might not be suitable for valorisation due to composition complexity and should be prioritised for energy conversion and composting over incineration and landfill Compared to homoge neous flow this waste stream is difficult to quantify in terms of potential scale and composition Rathore et al In addition it encounters logistical challenges from the collection and transportation process in geographically dispersed supply sources Kokossis and Koutinas FLW prevention and management options Fig shows the preferences in literature across various FLW pre vention and management options Recycling and recovery attract wider research attention compared to prevention and reuse which is aligned with the finding in KCN in Section Prevention and reuse As noted in Section prevention and reuse are only associated with surplus flow management Prevention in the review sample mainly Fig Type of research methods employed Fig Types of FLW flows Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics targets consumption stages but other parts of the supply chain are also discussed At the household level FLW generation is primarily derived from sociopsychological and cultural factors such as social norms perception education level individual preferences Todorova et al AschemannWitzel et al a b Thus a number of pa pers examined how these factors drive FLW generation eg in Mylan et al Hebrok and Heidenstr m Lehtokunnas et al Generic prevention practices that target more sustainable consumption are proposed including enhancing food literacy and knowledge in cooking and planned purchases Vilari no et al Hebrok and Heidenstr m acceptance of suboptimal foods and food safety perception AschemannWitzel et al a b A small body of literature in the review sample investigates the effectiveness of waste policy and prevention programs in shifting consumers behaviour such as sorting policy awareness campaign home composting promotion leftover consumptions eg in MiliutePlepiene and Plepys Andersson and Stage Johansson and Corvellec Zorpas et al From upstream of the FSC to retailers prevention can be attained by better logistics and more efficient management tools by for instance adequate storage cold chain management for perishable items spoilage prevention packaging smaller plates at different prices Vilari no et al In addition it is suggested that prevention efforts are prioritised for more resourceintensive products such as red meat and dairy products Teigiserova et al Retailers and restaurants can contribute to lowering household food waste generation eg by standardising data labelling printing food storage tips on carrier bags or revising promotion campaigns for perishable foods Vilari no et al Teigiserova et al Similarly processing firms can reduce food wastes by remanufacturing or selling with promotion and discount Garrone et al Some studies quantitatively assess the impacts of prevention in comparison with FLW management methods such as reuse AD compost and incineration Albizzati et al Brancoli et al The most extensive list is found in Crist obal et al a b who evaluated twelve prevention measures seven reuse and three recyclingrecovery practices The results of these studies supported prevention and reuse as the most favourable options in term of envi ronmental performance Reuse has gained growing research recognition with a diversity of sharing models eg harvest sharing meal sharing and leftover sharing Zurek and numerous other sharing initiatives Facchini et al Although reuse might not automatically translate to FLW reduction Morone et al it enhances social welfare reduces food poverty and alleviates hunger Zhu et al Based on an analysis of foodsharing platforms Michelini et al proposed a novel way to divide reuse into Sharing for charity Sharing for the communities Sharing for money Michelini et al The review sample paid equal attention to all three types Sharing for money also known as pseudo sharing is primarily in form of Business to Consumer BC allowing retailers and catering outlets to post unsold foods on social media so consumers can buy However it can also be in Business to Business BB form eg where collectors gather food leftovers from retailers and make value out of them Choi et al Sharing for charity is in BB and Customer to Business CB forms where food is collected from all sorts of donors and redistributed to food banks at local and national scale eg food aid activities in Finland Tikka or donation of retailers Lee and Tongarlak Sharing for community also known as Peer to Peer PP sharing is when food is shared amongst consumers eg food sharing in the campus environment Lazell Morone et al PP has become increasingly popular in practice thanks to the webbased platform and mobile apps Harvey et al Makov et al PP users are commonly found to be in the group with lower income yet higher education level Makov et al However the outreach of reuse might encounter the following challenges market fragmentation traceability and responsibility of food donors strict safety and hygiene norms Zurek Sarti et al Tikka lack of coherent efforts uncertainty in the estimation of surplus availability Facchini et al low participation interests due to time and effort incurred and psychological barriers Makov et al Recycle and recovery A plethora of options are identified to extract and retain the value from biowaste but they are normally grouped into three technological pathways thermochemical physiochemical and biochemical processes Nizami et al The thermochemical process such as pyrolysis or gasification is used to turn biogas into fuels electricity and heat Physiochemical like transesterification converts biowaste into fuels and bioproducts Biochemical like AD or fermentation aims to turn biowaste into energy and fertilisers These technological options have been thoroughly reviewed in the literature Appendix Examples are manifold valorisation option in Mirabella et al Teigiserova et al AD in CapsonTojo et al biorefinery models in Venkata Mohan et al pyrolysis in Elkhalifa et al The output of the technological options for processing biowaste can be grouped into four categories i biobased materials ii animal feed iii energy and iv compost As presented in Fig the conversion of biowaste to energy and bio based materials received the widest attention in the literature followed by compost production The literature is limited on the production of animal feeds The main feedstock for biobased material extraction and animal feeds are agroresidues byproducts from processing eg fruit pulp and vegetablefruit wastes which are homogeneous in nature Conversely the main feedstock for energy conversion is from heterog enous organic MSW flow such as household or restaurant wastes Although the CE encourages a cascading use of multiple products across various industries via valorisation or biorefinery the highest interest remains on foodtoenergy conversion which could be partly attributed to the policy supports eg subsidies for energy recovery in diverting organic waste from landfill Berbel and Posadillo The opportunities and challenges associated with each type of output category are synthesised and summarised in Table These are not merely influenced by technological feasibility Genovese et al but also impacted by supply market logistics policy quantification issues The first column in Table lists the four output categories The Fig

Guilayn et al Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics assessment of current impacts and future scenarios Fig encapsulates the distribution of studies conducting at least one pillar of sustainability impact assessment SIA In general attention is given predominantly to environmental impact or economic feasibility assessment or a combi nation of both The social assessment is scarcely addressed and this is attributed to the absence of reliable data and consistent assessment metrics Sgarbossa and Russo Crist obal et al a b Sgarbossa and Russo further argued that the promotion of FLW circular practices positively contributed to social sustainability Table summarises a list of commonly used indicators in the review sample It is noted that there is a lack of a clear guideline on the use of criter iaindicatorsmetrics in the literature Belaud et al Zabaniotou recommended borrowing a list of biorefinery sustainability indicators for SIA given FLW is utilised as feedstock in biorefinery Unfortunately none of the papers in the review sample adopted this set Environmental impact assessment A large body of literature in the review sample papers employed LCA to conduct environmental impact assessment LCA is a standardised methodology in ISO standards ISO a b and the Interna tional Reference Life Cycle Data System ILCD handbook Chom khamsri et al to evaluate potential environmental impacts and resources used throughout a product s life cycle LCA can be used on its own or combined with other quantitative tools eg mathematical modelling Cobo et al Crist obal et al a b or agentbased modelling FernandezMena et al LCA is also modified into Life Cycle Protein Assessment LCPA to calculate protein content in the FSC Laso et al A variety of LCA methodologies in FLW management is reviewed in De Menna et al Omolayo et al Different impact categories have been used with the support of LCA software like SimaPro and Gabi Several studies in the review sample e g Laso et al Santagata et al Slorach et al a b Schmidt Rivera et al Slorach et al use all or almost all of impact categories in ReCiPe midpoint methodology The remaining only adopt several impact categories such as global warming potential GWP Eutrophication Potential EP Acidification potential AP Laso et al and fossil resource depletion potential FRDP Vaneeckhaute et al Several papers merely address the carbon footprint GHG savingsemissions of different waste treatment options six redistribution and treatment options in Eriksson et al five valorisation and recycling options in Scherhaufer et al composting and AD in a supermarket Marrucci et al Although justification is provided for the selection of a subset of in dicators Sgarbossa and Russo variations in the selections might challenge the crosscomparison or mislead the interpretation of the results Resource usage indicators including energy and water are also measured in several studies using a life cycle approach Edwards et al for instance evaluated the energy balance of seven waste management systems Further Hoehn et al proposed Energy Return on Investment Circular economy index EROIce to quantify the amount of energy recovered from FLW among three options AD incineration and landfill with energy recovery Laso Margallo Gar caHerrero et al combined four indicators water energy con sumption GWP and nutritional content indicators to consider three treatment options i animal feed ii incineration iii landfilling with energy recovery Economic impact assessment To evaluate economic impacts the review sample employed the following economic indicators treatment cost profitability index NPV IRR payback period These indicators are assessed using tools such as BreakEven Point BEP analysis in Ferella et al Levelized Cost of Energy LCOE in Muradin et al Hoo et al and LCC in Sakai et al De Menna et al Slorach et al a LCC adopts the life cycling thinking to calculate the cost of a product and service over its life span and is standardised for specific product cate gories like petroleum ISO Compared to LCA the LCC studies for FLW management and valorisation routes is still in its infancy with neither a common methodological approach nor an effective and transparent categorisation of costs De Menna et al In addition it is desirable to combine LCC with other indicators such as revenues profit valueadded to reflect larger economic impacts Ecoenvironmental impact assessment A combined economic and efficiency assessment is also common For example Albizzati et al compare environmental and economic impacts of four options for surplus management at a supermarket donation animal feeds AD and incineration Muradin et al combined LCA and LCOE indicators to evaluate the environmental and economic effectiveness of the wastetoenergy process An integrated LCC and LCA framework for FLW prevention and management was proposed in De Menna et al but only Slorach et al a carried out the LCALCC assessment for four options AD invessel composting incineration and landfill Three impact assessment environmental economic social A handful of studies in the review sample addressed three impacts simultaneously and the adopted indicators are dissimilar For instance Santos and Magrini employed waste emission reduction GHG savings potential job creation and feedstock remuneration premium whereas Sgarbossa and Russo measured the energy selfsufficiency indicator ESS profitability indicator PI employment possibility indicator Vaneeckhaute et al utilised two economic indicators NPV and IRR four environment indicators GWP EP AP FRDP and a stakeholders perception inquiry as a social impact factor Discussion a synthesis of research streams and research agenda The findings from KCN analysis in Section suggested that impact assessment biorefinery and nutrient recycling are three underlying research lines in extant literature This is supported by a significant number of articles found on these topics from the structural dimension analysis Section However the finegrained analysis in Section also gave rise to other critical factors of FLW management under the CE framework Methodological analysis indicated the important role of the FLW flows quantification and statistical assessment Three types of FLW flows surplus homogeneity and heterogeneity follow different pre vention and management pathways but they encounter challenges arising from the following sources technologies supply quantification logistics market factors policy Grounded in the detailed and extensive analysis we propose a novel way of classifying the literature in FLW management under the CE into six research streams i FLW stream supply and quantification ii practices and technological aspects iii logistics and supply chain management vi market demand v SIA vi policy and legislation This novel classification aims to push further evolution in this everincreasing research agenda Table FLW supply and quantification The reliable quantification of potential FLW flows is the first and crucial step in supporting the formation of effective FLW interventions and policies in all three flows of FLW Corrado and Sala Hamelin Fig Types of sustainability impact assessments Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics et al This helps to monitor the progress of FLW reduction over time Garrone et al estimate the potentials of redistribution activities Facchini et al and identify the important waste stream with respect to mass in order to evaluate its potential for different treatment options Imbert Metson et al This also offers a solution to overcome the scattered and unstable supply issue of FLW especially the residues that bear regional and seasonal patterns Caruso et al Gaglio et al and alleviate the risk of yearround operation ie by combining multiseasonal feedstocks Vardanega et al Banerjee et al Unfortunately the unavailability of FLW data and high variability in accounting methods hinder the reliable quantification of FLW flows Corrado et al Teigiserova et al There is a pressing need to improve availability reliability and level of detail in the data on the volume of food loss waste and surplus generation Corrado and Sala Crist obal et al a b Facchini et al A useful recommendation for enhancing the FLW generation data at the household level is based on consumers diaries weighting and source separation Teigiserova et al Similarly although some FLW accounting methods such as MFA Metson et al Amicarelli et al Stephan et al or geolocalized methodology Hamelin et al have been applied FLW quantifi cation is in urgent need of a harmonised methodology Further as FLW occurs at all stages of FSC future work should be conducted at the supply chain level such as the case of pasta in Principato et al to quickly locate the hotspots of FLW generation along the supply chain and allocate efforts to tackle the problems In addition to FLW accounting it is significant to grasp insights into the chemical composition and energy content of different FLW types Nizami et al Barreira et al because they influence the choice of optimal technologies for biobased production However the knowledge of FLW chemical composition and energy content is fairly limited Banerjee et al which opens up an avenue for future studies to explore Practices and technological aspects of FLW prevention and management Prevention and reuse As analysed in Section prevention practices vary across the supply chain Household FLW reduction mainly aims at shifting be haviours whereas the upper parts of the FSC focus primarily on better logistics and more efficient management There is an increasing interest in exploring the impact of food packaging on FLW minimisation Kakadellis and Harris which paves the way for further research such as the role of innovative sustainable food packaging solutions in preserving food quality prolonging food shelflife and reducing FLW level ie Guillard et al or the accounting method for packagingrelated FLW ie Pauer et al Wohner et al The promotion of biodegradable packaging in FSC which is in line with the pure circle principle of the CE is also a topic of great interest in this angle As for reuse specified in Section the existence of all three sharing models sharing for money sharing for charity and sharing for community is evident in both practice and academics To unlock their full potential the following research agendas are proposed There is a call for further investigation into the enablers and de terminants of the users engagement in all three food sharing models Michelini et al particularly PP a pure sharing model where donorrecipient reciprocity and balance are rare Harvey et al Examples of enablers include the perception and so cioeconomic status of online sharing donors volunteers and re cipients Stigma from recipients of food eg feeling embarrassment or indebtedness or fear might challenge the collection of data for this type of research In addition the scope of these studies should target various FSC actors from farmers processors retailers restaurants and household to nonprofit organisations Zhu et al The quantitative examinations of the performance and associated benefits of different sharing models are desirable Although Choi et al evaluated the impacts of a sharing for money platform authors recommend that future researchers conduct performance comparison studies for all three types of food sharing models Recycle and recovery When surplus turns to waste appropriate FLW recycle and recovery are necessary to retain the FLW value which is aligned with the regenerative and cascading principle of CE As we have been in a petroleumbased society for many years biorefinery that integrates multiple processes needs to be promoted at an industrial scale to effec tively compete and replace the fossilfuel industry Vardanega et al However a significant number of experiments and technological review papers in the review sample Section suggest that FLWbased biorefinery technologies are mainly at conceptual design laboratoryscale or pilotscale level The technical viability and eco nomic feasibility assessments for the upscale potentials of these inte grated processes are urgently needed Caldeira et al These assessments can be aided by computational tools such as process modelling and simulation Vardanega et al Section revealed biorefinery and ADbased technologies as two dominant research lines in the review sample Biorefinery is linked to the valorisation of the homogeneous stream to generate higherend products such as bioactive compounds and animal feed using insect rearing AD on the other hand is associated with energy and compost generation using the heterogeneous FLW feedstock Compared to the Table Sustainability impact assessment main indicators and metrics Sustainability pillars Commonly used

is a mature technology with high TRL and has been increasingly deployed in practice However operational AD plants using FLW substrate prevalently adopt monoprocesses for biogas production which results in the underutilisation of associated resources Lytras et al Recent research interests have been extended to allow the production of multiple highvalue products along with biogas Examples of desirable outputs include biomethane biohydrogen lactic acid suc cinic acid volatile fatty acids bioelectricity technological details are available in the review papers of Lytras et al and Dahiya et al The technological feasibility and financial feasibility of a sequential production of lactic acid and biogas from FLW were confirmed in Barampouti et al Further Section signalled the issue of low yield and small capacity as the limitations of the current waste conversion technologies not only for unproven technologies like biomaterial extractions but also for the proven technologies like AD As such the investigation into optimising process design to produce mul tiple highvalue output products and enhance yields at commercial scale level to maximise the economic feasibility continues to be the promising research avenue for future studies Logistics and supply chain management Logistics and supply chain management are essential parts of FLW prevention and management Barampouti et al Weber et al A significant portion of FLW particularly for perishable items is attributed to logistics activities and extensive supply chain networks which drives the shift towards a more sustainable production and con sumption model a short FSC where foods are produced and consumed locally Kiss et al As tackling the FLW issue cannot be achieved by the voluntary action of a single actor the commitment of all actors in the entire FSC which might involve rethinking the supply chain model to minimise FLW such as via promoting short FSC is essential Muriana Thus we suggested a new research line devoted to the unveiling of the performance of short FSC compared to the traditional counterpart taking FLW into consideration As for reuse a quantitative examination of various supply chain management issues including logistics supply contract operational risks revenue models Choi et al is advocated to determine the critical factors underpinning the success of each sharing model Michelini et al For instance Choi et al established logistics cost as the significant factor justifying the benefits of the food sharing models An effective recycle and recovery of FLW entails the establishment of extensive logistics networks and supply chain management from the collection transportation to the production process before launching the output products to the market Barampouti et al When collec tion and transportation stages are responsible for significant environ mental impacts addressing logistics issues associated with these stages such as the geographic location of plants inbound and outbound transport types and distances is a crucial point that has been emphas ised in many papers in review samples eg Nizami et al Carillo et al Muradin et al Vaneeckhaute et al Slorach et al b Future studies could fruitfully pursue the following research avenues Further innovations in smart collection and transportation systems Several innovative collection systems are proposed and evaluated in the literature the use of underthesink FLW disposal connected to a sewer system pipelines for FLW transport instead of trucks Muradin et al the use of biodiesel for truck transportation Santagata et al precomposter for FLW mass and volume reduction at the collection point Sakarika et al drying process to reduce moisture content allowing longer storage and lower transportation cost

growing interest in decentralised FLW conversion technologies in the review sample e g smart bin fermentation system Yeo et al Although fewer Table Research agenda basing on the taxonomy framework

Develop a harmonised SIA indicator set for three dimensions of sustainability Conduct spatial and temporal LCA studies in different areas and socioeconomic contexts Assess the entire waste hierarchy including the prevention and reuse options Assess the benefits and impacts of the production of FLWbased products versus fossilbased counterparts and FLWbased products versus first generation biomassbased alternatives Policy and legislation Examine the effectiveness of the incentives policy on FLW prevention and reuse and management options Solve the conflicting and unharmonised policies and regulations that could hinder the promotion of circular FLW prevention and management practices Conduct a crosscountry comparison on the influences of policy setting on FLW prevention and preventions directions Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics plants of bigger size can optimise the economy of scale its envi ronmental benefits cannot offset the environmental impact deriving from longer transport distance Take AD plant for instance it was proven that the plant can only create a favourable environmental impact when located within km of the maize cropland Muradin et al An interesting argument put forward by Teigiserova et al indicates that for a FLWbased biorefinery plant the economy of scope that relies on cascading production is independent of scale which is beneficial to small and medium scale shortchain biorefineries Besides large biorefinery plants with long transport distances and a long value chain lead to a reduction in the feedstock quality and high transport emissions The rapid deterioration nature of FLW implies a further loss in nutrient contents Smaller plants on the other hand reduce the associated transport cost and alleviate the pressures on the required infrastructure for sorting storage and transportation Mak et al while intensifying the production process to increase valueadded Banerjee et al Barampouti et al This trend also incentivises the closedloop model which is aligned with the industrial symbiosis principle of the CE for instance a decentralised biogas plant is located in the vicinity of an agrifood processing plant from which the FLW feedstock is supplied to the biogas plant via transmission pipelines while the generated heat is fed back to the processing plant or its farms Muradin et al Market demand for food surplus and biobased products This factor is not applicable to prevention but crucial for other op tions For reuse special attention should be paid to deriving a reliable approximation for the financial value of food surplus circulated in three sharing models thereby reflecting better the real value brought about by these sharing operations Richards and Hamilton Harvey et al For recycle and recovery technological feasibility and contin uous supply assurance are not the only constraints for commercial suc cess The market factor should be taken into consideration to expand and diversify market outlets of biobased products and attract investors interest Woon and Lo Borrello et al Genovese et al Chojnacka et al Mak et al Thus we call for more studies on two following research avenues To further investigate customers perception and interest towards FLWbased products When the market price of biobased products is found to be higher than the fossilbased alternatives such as in cases of bioplastics in Shogren et al Teigiserova et al and biofertilizers in Chojnacka et al drivers for purchasing biobased products stem directly from attitude and indirectly from green selfidentity Thus insights into consumers attitudes and how those attitudes might be influenced provide useful information to producers and consumers beyond the basic idea of how FLW can potentially be recovered for reuse Russo et al To explore the generic market condition factors ie market satura tion and market power of the output products This is because the market price of biobased products is strongly linked to the global supply and demand of both bio and fossilbased products Teigi serova et al Undoubtedly the more expensive the products become the higher the incentives to tap into the cheaper alternatives eg lowcost food waste resources Moreover such incentives also depend on market power Take the fertiliser market as a salient example As demand for fertiliser always exceeds supply fertiliser producers who possess strong market power are less likely without an explicit support regime to alter their hundredyear fossilbased production technology Chojnacka et al The nutritional value and safety analysis entail further attention to enhance the understanding of endusers about the potential benefits and impacts Longhurst et al Teigiserova et al This should be supported by scientific evidence especially for nutraceu tical products where their effectiveness might not be clear Sustainability impact assessment Section revealed that the selection of optimal FLW prevention and management options requires a detailed economic environmental and social assessment Meanwhile there is a growing interest in the adoption of a life cycling approach to aid such a decision Ingrao et al Laso et al Omolayo et al because it fosters the development of a coherent modelling and a systematic analytical framework of FLW prevention and management De Menna et al Four future research avenues are identified in this section We call for the development of a list of friendly integrated sustain ability impact indicators allowing a balance between environmentallyfriendly goals economic returns and social bene fits in future FLW prevention and management research This need is also underscored in a number of papers eg Zabaniotou Omolayo et al Much attention is given to environmental and economic assessments while the inclusion of social aspects is rare and mainly constrained to job creation Ubando et al which demands further consideration A list of social indicators proposed by Kooduvalli et al Ioannidou et al can be employed Additionally an integrated LCA LCC and social life assessment sLCA for triplebottomline assessment opens up interesting research avenues for future studies Imbert Mak et al Further we recommend that SIA indicators are tailored for specific target products eg creation of biogasspecific technical standards for biogasderived energy Ingrao et al Moreover the incorporation of a nutritional value in SIA also leaves a promising avenue of research in the future ie in Ingrao et al Laso et al Since laws and policies regarding FLW vary across spatial context and best practices are influenced by seasons and locations there is a need for developing spatial and temporal SIA studies in different areas and socioeconomic contexts at different periods to enhance data transparency facilitate crosscomparison and support spatially and temporally targeted FLW polices Omolayo et al A dearth of studies incorporates prevention and reuse the top pri orities in the waste hierarchy in SIA This is partly attributed to the methodical difficulties in acquiring reliable data concerning FLW prevention actions Crist obal et al a b Due to the contextladen characteristics of FLW issues the waste hierarchy should only be seen as a rough generalisation Eriksson and Spng berg Donation might not always be as strictly environmen tally efficient as AD or incineration Eriksson et al An SIA applicable to all levels of the waste hierarchy is desirable to inform decisionmaking and in the long term promote the design of sus tainable and costefficient interventions and more resourceefficient FSC Crist obal et al a b Further it is unlikely that a single option in the waste hierarchy is sufficient to tackle the FLW problem For instance although reuse is favourable food hygiene or biosecurity decreases the likelihood of reuse for the entire FLW stream thus a flexible combination of prevention reuse recycling and recovery tailored for the local infrastructure is highly recom mended Eriksson and Spngberg Similarly SIA should also be carried out to assess the comparative impacts of the production of the FLWbased products versus fossil based counterparts Ioannidou et al and of FLWbased products versus firstgeneration biomassbased alternatives Mak et al This is to avoid the suboptimal designs of FLWbased biorefineries with almost the same environmental burdens as the petrochemical systems Zabaniotou and Kamaterou Q Do et al International Journal of Production Economics Policy and legislation Policy and legislation are widely acclaimed for their instrumental role in shaping national FLW prevention and management directions For instance the UK policies incentivise FLW prevention and conversion to energy and compost while surplus food redistribution has not gained equal interest Facchini et al Combined with the highly frag mented and independent redistribution efforts the outreach of food redistribution initiatives in the UK is therefore limited The provision of government incentives is important to develop a larger and coherent redistribution system at all stages of the FSC Facchini et al and to make the best use of sharing models for the entire FSC Choi For prevention the government can shift the FSC actors awareness and behaviour towards more sustainable production and consumption models via educational programs FLW monitoring and FLW separation policy at the household level Although the effectiveness of these cam paigns has been analysed in several studies Jereme et al Johansson and Corvellec AschemannWitzel et al a b these studies are confined to a specific contextsetting Similar studies could be replicated in different countries to support policy making progress The organisation and efficiency of short FSC can also be fundamentally affected by governmental support or regulatory pol icies Kiss et al For reuse and recycle policy and legislation can progress and hinder these FLW activities As a driver law and regulations influence the development of specific FLW management routes via penalty and reward instruments such as subsidy tax relief biofuel obligation or disposal fee Liu et al Zabaniotou Ferella et al A ban on surplus disposal at supermarkets such as in France promotes donations efforts Lee and Tongarlak Richards and Hamilton Harvey et al In addition strong legislative support can educate consumers to recognise the benefits of biobased product con sumption which increases public acceptance and induces behavioural change This contributes to ensuring the market demand for FLWbased products Conversely conflicting and unharmonised policies might constrain engagement in FLW management The unclear legal status of digestate as analysed in Section is a stark example Besides legal restrictions might eliminate the potential for fullscale implementation of the valorisation options Quina et al such as the EU stringent regulation on the reuse of foods as animal feeds and bans on the use of animal byproducts as feeds zu Ermgassen et al Thus relegislation should be considered to help farmers to cut cost save land use and environmental impacts Further a lack of a longterm support regime by the government prevents the diffusion of innovative techno logical initiatives Genovese et al It is noted that as FLWrelated policy support and legal regimes vary from country to country De Clercq et al crosscountry com parison offers interesting insights and useful lessons to be learnt For instance Teigiserova et al underlined the variations in the food surplus reuse strategies of the EU member countries Italy encourages food donation in the whole FSC Denmark Belgium France only target the retail level Germany Portugal and Hungary stimulate food dona tion via tax deduction Giordano et al compared Italian and French laws regarding FLW hierarchy and uncovered that Italian law puts more effort into prevention by raising awareness campaigns while French laws focus mostly on the actions of supermarkets De Clercq et al who compared the legal framework of seven countries for FLWbased AD technology associated the rapid proliferation of AD plants in China with its centralised policy setting and recommended that China adopt consumptionlinked subsidy schemes as in Germany and Sweden to tie the payments to the amount of biogas consumed rather than the amount produced to avoid biogas being dumped at low price The paper also underlined the role of the policies in the UK and France in incentivising the production of multiple outputs such as electricity heat and biofertiliser from AD plants in order to ensure revenue stability for plant operators Conclusion and limitations Conclusion In this study a novel taxonomy is proposed to synthesise and classify the exhaustive and highly fragmented FLW literature under the CE landscape into six streams of research i FLW sourcing and quantifi cation ii practices and technological aspects iii logistics and supply chain management iv market factor v sustainability impact assess ment vi policy and legislation The taxonomy allows us to accentuate current research lines and paves the way for future research directions Table While the spotlights in the academic agenda are currently on the second and fifth factors FLW prevention practices and conversion technologies and LCAbased SIA more consideration needs to be given to the remaining factors We believe that this study offers fruitful suggestions for scholars at the crossroads of two domains the CE and FLW management First our taxonomy urges comprehensive approaches towards an integrated FLW prevention and management framework for gaining the overall benefits beyond technological feasibility Extensive research agendas can direct future researchers towards the achievement of such a holistic approach while avoiding stagnant and saturated research areas Second a thor ough discussion of how the CE principles are translated into FLW pre vention and management offers an insight into the underlying features of the FLW under the CE that goes beyond the waste hierarchy Although this study is primarily oriented towards an academic audience it has clear implications for policymakers and decisionmakers The taxonomy offers a useful guideline for managers and policymakers in structuring their strategies and actions for effective FLW prevention and manage ment at both national and supply chain levels Managers are encouraged to quantify FLWrelated problems and explore a range of potential op tions to tackle them These options should be quantitatively assessed to apprehend possible tradeoffs considering six research streams in the taxonomy framework simultaneously Policymakers play an instru mental role in keeping these options open to managers via effective incentive schemes Meanwhile conflicts and ambiguity in laws and regulations should be solved on the basis of scientific evidence Limitations Finally it is important to point out certain limitations of the paper The first limitation comes from our search restriction to two databases Scopus and Web of Science which might exclude relevant papers that have not been listed in one of these databases However we believe that the rigour of the entire SLR process which covers and reflects the extensive body of knowledge offers a fairly comprehensive and sys tematic picture of the research topic and thus the credibility of research results is ensured In addition the breadth of the study may come at the cost of the depth of the analysis We have used a reasonable mix of keywords on two large topics FLW and CE that yield a significant number of papers without constraint to a particular research domain Although relevant references are provided in each section to guide future researchers and alleviate the depth limitation we call for more collaborative research among researchers from diversified fields such as supply chain management and operation management to deepen the understanding of the role of each factor in our framework Acknowledgements The research is sponsored or partially sponsoredsupported
