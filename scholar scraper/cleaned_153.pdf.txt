da Vinci Milan Italy ARTICLE INFO Keywords Circular economy Food waste hierarchy Food waste prevention Technologies Collaborations ABSTRACT Food systems are plagued by the grand sustainability challenge of food waste which represents a urging issue from economic environmental and social point of view dThe Circular Economy paradigm can open up different actions which are framed within the socalled Food Waste Hierarchy FWH In these regards scholars recommend to leverage on those practices that are able to prevent the generation of surplus food preserving a higher share of the sustainable value For these preharvest and postharvest practices that go under the name of prevention or reuse strategies in different FWH technology plays a crucial role Through a set of semistructured interviews with technology providers as well as with companies in the agrifood supply chain the present work investigates extensively the range of the available technologies and the detailed objectives of such technologies for food loss and waste prevention ie fore casting monitoring grouping shelf life extension product quality and value upgrading Moreover different forms of collaboration enable to reach these objectives in different ways Collaboration with technology pro viders can be based on continuous technical assistance and consulting for data elaboration and data analysis as well as on full data sharing and codesign allowing to achieve a different impact on food loss and waste pre vention Finally our study reveals that the adoption of different technological options can represent the engine to establish vertical collaborations between the adopter of the technology and another stage in the agrifood supply chain in order to fight food waste and loss with a coordinated supply chain effort Introduction Food waste reduction is one of the sustainability grand challenges for food systems Food waste derives from an ineffective management of food surplus Papargyropoulou et al Garrone et al To indicate the total amount of wastage generated within different stages of food supply chain the terms food losses and food wastes are commonly used Vilario et al The common expression of food loss and waste FLW includes a share of total food production that was originally intended for human consumption but not consumed Gustavsson et al FLW is food that is produced retailed or served but it is not consumed and not re distributed to feed people animals or used for new edible products Garrone et al Notably food loss is generally associated with the quantity lost during the production postharvest and processing stage whereas food waste refer to food that is fit for human consumption but that is discarded in retail food service or consumption stage Vilario et al FAO In the definitions of FLW different stages of food production are considered from the moment in which crops are ready for harvest until the consumption stage Chaboud and Daviron From field to fork postharvest losses are estimated to be the of all food production Godfray et al which amounts to billion tons per year worldwide Gustavsson et al Surplus food can be managed in different stages of the food supply chain in such a way that it does not end up degrading into FLW thus surplus food can be recovered for human consumption or it can be prevented at the source limiting the unnecessary use of natural re sources Garrone et al The Circular Economy CE paradigm appears to be paramount in this context as it opens up different solutions to tackle food waste that refer to practices and approaches that combine technological solutions behavioral and cultural changes as well as policy recommendations  Received January Received in revised form June Accepted August

Conservation Recycling Published by Elsevier BV TVilario et al In particular Food Waste Hierarchy FWH frameworks suggest different available options for organizations to tackle food waste identifying a set of priority actions Redlingshfer et al which are ranked mostly from an environmental impact perspective from the most sound environmental option to the least one Cristbal et al Nevertheless the actions and strategies connected with the layers in the upper part of the FWH ie food waste prevention are underrepresented in the current literature Redlingshfer et al The gap in the understanding of the potential benefits of such solutions leads to a lack of guidance to choose the most effective technologies for FLW prevention On the technological side in the recent years the urging challenge of food waste has represented a fertile ground for technological innova tions All in all different technologies can support the valorization of food waste at different levels of the FWH Vandermeersch et al ab thus tackling the issue while opening up new business op portunities Notwithstanding the priority role assigned the adoption of the in novative technological solutions for food waste prevention can bring relevant challenges for the companies in the food supply chain The key competences and technical expertise related to such infrastructures and technologies eg innovative food packaging or innovative process technologies Mourad lie outside the agrifood supply chain therefore immediate and potential performance are uncertain and dif ficult to be fully understood by agrifood players These solutions might end up in becoming weak forms of prevention if not properly sup ported by a shift in the business model Mourad This uncertain scenario does not clarify what are the extra efforts and costs that these technologies might represent for some actors within the chain and whether or not they would be compensated by extra benefits for one or more players along the agrifood supply chain Hence these technologies are just partially explored in the literature and little is known about the implications connected to their adoption by the players in the food supply chain The present paper through a set of semistructured interviews explores i the typologies of tech nological solutions proposed by different technology providers for FLW prevention and ii which factors stimulate or hinder their adoption under different forms and the application within the agrifood supply chain The paper develops as follows Section reports a synthetic over view on the literature background Section present the research questions and methodology while Section and are focused on the presentation of the results and their discussion and conclusions re spectively Background The sustainability challenges of food loss and waste Food loss and waste FLW is a relevant issue from the social en vironmental and economic standpoint As for the economic dimension reducing FLW represents a saving for all the actors in the supply chain Chaboud and Daviron Notably initiatives that tackle FLW at its roots are beneficial for food producers that aim to sell more but also to consumers who could have access to available food which is more affordable De Steur et al Whether and to what extent managing surplus food to prevent FLW can outweigh the cost connected to the extra operations needed to handle this surplus food is still subject to a debate in the literature Chaboud and Daviron Regarding the environmental dimension a significant amount of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers energy and water are used to produce then process transport distribute store and make food available for human consumption Consequently FLW is also a waste of land water energy and inputs Gustavsson et al Yet all the actions that aim not only at managing surplus food but preventing its generation can decrease the pressure that is exerted on natural re sources Timmermans et al Chaboud and Daviron In addition to the important implications for the environment surplus food and food waste prevention can also have a considerable impact on the society A reduction in the FLW generates indeed higher food security that extends the benefits to households Timmermans et al Chaboud and Daviron When surplus food is redistributed thanks to food aid organizations or food banks to people who normally struggle to have access to nutritional food food waste from a social point of view is avoided Garrone et al and thus there is a direct impact on the social dimension Moreover the increasing awareness around the socalled food paradox ie having a large amount of food waste in a world which is still food insecure FAO represents a re levant social driver for the implementation of FLW reduction strategies The food that is wasted every year could indeed feed the nearly one in nine people all over the world who suffers from hunger especially in developing and underdeveloped countries Godfray et al Circular economy and food waste management hierarchies Circular Economy represents a compelling reference framework for the management of food waste Teigiserova et al Put differently food waste valorization options like reduction reuse and recycling support the aims of the circular economy paradigm Geueke et al Food waste hierarchies as waste hierarchies in general represent a powerful guidance for practitioners and policy makers to understand possible practices to be adopted As Table exhibits different priorities of actions and different policies to follow for food waste management are embedded into different hierarchical frameworks that have been devel oped after the Waste Framework Directive EC European Commission In the Food Waste Hierarchy FWH framework introduced by Papargyropoulou et al for example the strategies of avoiding surplus food generation as well as the strategy of reusing surplus food for human consumption are high priority strategies because they allow to reduce the depletion of natural resources and to limit the negative social and ethical implications of FLW Garrone et al is aligned with the view that prevention of FLW through different redis tribution and reuse options still targets human consumption thus mini mizing the waste from a social perspective Garrone et al iden tifies different reuse options eg remanufacturing and repacking sales with promotions and discounts sales in secondary channels as adhoc distributor for surplus food as well as redistribution both internal to the employees of a company and external through the collaboration with food aid organizations Rood et al classify the different redis tribution and reuse options not implying reprocessing as forms of human food recovery In a distinct layer in the ladder they instead consider converting into human food in those cases in which food products are transformed into new edible products so they are not consumed in their original forms Interestingly while most of the frameworks are aligned in terms of available options in the lower parts of the waste hierarchy ranging from recycling of food products into notedible alternatives food recovery for the generation of energy and then incineration and disposal some differences can be found moving up the waste hierarchy When referring to prevention policies Garrone et al and Vandermeersch et al ab refer to the prevention of food waste and loss and not the reduction or avoidance of surplus food This approach focuses on avoiding the post harvest losses and thus considering the possible generation of food waste from the moment in which food pro ducts are ready to be harvested Chaboud and Daviron The Food Recovery Hierarchy United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA esplicitly considers the reduction of the volume of surplus food generated as the strategy having highest priority As a whole extant food waste hierarchies focus primarly on priorities of actions to manage surplus food considering harvesting losses as unavoidable hence F Ciccullo et al Resources Conservation Recycling devoting less attention to nonyields or less productivity in the farming operations Chaboud and Daviron Nevertheless especially the upstream stages of the food supply chain have the greatest potentials to prevent the generation of food surplus through new infrastructures skills as well as storage and transportation technologies Papargyropoulou et al The technologies for surplus food prevention and management in the agrifood industry Technology is a fundamental element in the CE framework which claims for socially radical and technologically advanced solutions to create effective circular patterns Ghisellini et al This is true especially for translating the CE frameworks in the food industry into specific actions which requires the support of the technology for any layers in the FWH Notably the role of technology to prevent and manage surplus food is recognized as pivotal in moving up the food waste hierarchy thus offering innovative tools to support companies in the top and highpriority layers of the food waste hierarchy Tech nology not only has a crucial role in the conversion of waste but most importantly in the prevention of useless extraction of raw materials Nilsen For example information technologies can facilitate food sharing and redistribution via web platforms or apps Harvey et al Instead strategies for effectively manage surplus food once surplus food is generated are generally linked to transfor mation technologies since they deal with processing the surplus food in order to obtain animal feeding fertilizers or energy Arshadi et al ReFED Laufenberg et al Girotto et al Nevertheless the implications deriving from the adoption of technologies for surplus food prevention are disregarded in literature In fact literature mostly focuses on tackling food waste from the moment agricultural products are ready for harvest Chaboud and Daviron while a limited body of contributions analyze more in depth the adoption of technologies to prevent the generation of surplus food in the preharvesting phase As a whole the agrifood context represents a fertile ground for the development of technological solutions to prevent and manage surplus food spanning all the layers in the food waste hierarchy The high perishability of food products indeed has led to the emergence of new technologies that allow to extend the shelf life of the products both through packaging technologies to enhance and extend conservation Parfitt et al and through adhoc storage systems Van Holsteijn and Kemna The high intrinsic recoverability of some food products in parti cular as fruits and vegetables Garrone et al together with the high potential of their byproducts to be reprocessed opens up to ad ditional transformation technologies to obtain a new edible derivative product Galanakis Interestingly new technologies can also help prior to the harvesting phase through precision agriculture solutions that can represent po tentially innovative technologies not just considered from a system productivity point of view but also to prevent surplus food preharvest as well as to fight food insecurity Ambleredwards et al The picture of the available technological solutions is variegated Different technological options are currently not analyzed in terms of their actual applicability in the food ecosystem as well as in terms of impact on food waste and loss reduction as well as from an extended sustainability perspective More in general as technology is fast Table Different food waste hierarchies presented in the literature Name of the framework Levels in the hierarchy from most preferable to least preferable
