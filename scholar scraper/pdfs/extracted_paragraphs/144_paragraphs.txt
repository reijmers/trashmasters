First, current terminology related to food waste  was reviewed  and clarified , in particular , the terms food surplus, waste and losses. This work highlights   why the clarity of these definitions is crucial for the sustainability of future food waste  management systems , especially  in the context of circular economy . Through a simple  matrix, definition s are linked  to the concept s of edibility and possi bility of avoidance, leading  to six distinct  categories of food waste: i) edible , ii) naturally inedible  , iii) industria l  residue , iv) inedible due to natural causes , v) inedible due to ineffective management  and vi) not accounted for. Category I encompasses surplus food only ; category II -V food  waste and c ategory VI food losses. Based on this, an updated pyramid for food waste  hierarchy  is proposed , distinguish ing surplus food  and a new category  for material recycling ,  in order to reflect the future food waste biorefineries in the circular bioeconomy. Nutrient and  energy recovery are two separate categorie s and  the terms recovery and recycling  are  clarified . Finally, a circular economy framework  is presented  for food surplus and waste ,  considering closing the loop throughout the whole food supply chain , in connection with the  concept of strong and weak sust ainability. This is presented along with a review of key  EU  policies related to food waste and examples of initiatives from the Member States.

Introduction   Food waste  has been recognized as a global issue due to its  environmental (UNEP,  2014) , economic  , and social  impacts with global  consequences, requiring  a change in political actions (Evans et al., 2012;  WRAP, 2013;   IFPRI, 2016;  EC, 2018 ; Searchinger et al., 2019) . Food waste and losses mobilize a  remarkable amount of natural resources . It consumes around  25% of all water used by  agriculture each year   ; 23% of all cropland, equivalent to all  cropland in Africa   ; while it generates around 8% of annual global  greenhouse gas es  emissions   . The International Panel of Experts on  Sustainable Food Systems   identified that  20% of the food produced  in European  Union  is wasted with the cost of  143 billion euros annually, including  wasted resources  and environmental impact s  . Half of all vegetable grown is lost or wasted before  reaching the consumer  . Social and ethical dilemma                                                                                                                                                     CAP Common Agricultural Policy   CE Circular Economy   EoL E nd-of-life  EPA Environmental Protection Agency   EWC European Waste Codes   FFV Fresh fruits and vegetables   FSC Food supply chain   FSWL Food surplus, waste and loss   FW Food waste   GHG  global greenhouse gases   IFPRI Internationa l Food Policy Research Institute   SDG  Sustainable Development Goal   WFD  Waste Framework Directive    Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 4   touches upon, among others, the undernourished of 815 million people   while  excessive consumption in high -income countries leads to  billions of tonnes of quality food  thrown away  . Reynolds et al.   estimated that 921, 000 people, i.e.  the equivalent of the whole population of Fiji in 2019, could be annually fed by all avoidable  food waste in Australia.   In parallel, t he growing need for energy and materials to supply the demands of a fast - growing and res ource -intensive p opulation is  forcing a shift from a linear to a circular  economy. Circular economy treats waste as a secondary resource  (Ellen MacArthur  Foundation, 2013) . The EU has implemented an action plan for the Circular Economy, which  includes also a  commitment to meet the global Sustainable Development Goal    12.3 to  ―halve per capita food waste at the retail and consumer level, and reducing food losses along  production and supply chains  by 2030‖  (Flanagan et al.,  2018) . Circular Economy is redefining the framework conditio ns for the waste management  of food waste , creating new business opportunities . Food waste  can be used to produce various biomaterials  , bioenergy  ( Dahiya et  al., 2018) , as well as high -value products (Strati  and Oreopoulou, 2014;  Teigiserova et al.,  2019) .  Yet, being at the inflection point between the linear and circular paradigms it is important to  ensure that any new management model for food prevention and food wast e usage will be  sustainable , i.e. stay within planetary boundary guardrails  (Rockström et al., 2009;  Steffen et  al., 2015) . Adopting the concept of strong sustainability for European bioeconomy instead of  weak sustainability can be a crucial step  in this endeavor .  However, there are several challenges  towards food waste prevention and towards a  sustai nable food waste management system within the emerging circular bioeconomy . The Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 5   first one considers  the variable  definitions of food waste , and therefore  the possibility of   developing  coherent regulatory  metrics for quantification  .  Actual glob al losses  are an estimate  . The existing data include high uncertainty (Corrado et  al., 2019)  and different scopes for measurement s, making extrapolation and comparison of  data very challenging.    The second challenge lies in a failure to  distinguish food waste into appropriate categories  that could be linked with a corresponding waste hierarchy. The current waste hierarchy is not  properly distinguishing terminology in accordance with sustainable management. The terms  used in the hierarchy  do not have a clear scope  and are often used as synonyms, such as  ―food  loss‖ and ―food surplus‖, ―recycling‖  and ―reuse‖ , ―recycling‖  and ―recovery‖  (UNEP, 2014;   Bernstad Saraiva Schott et al., 2013) . A food  waste hierarchy distinguishing food surplus and  waste, but not clear end-of-life  pathways,  was proposed by  Papargyropoulou et al.   , while Garcia -Garcia et al.   expanded EoL the most , but with no distinctions of  surplus, waste and loss , and U.S. EPA classified industrial use in their hierarchy (Dou et al.,  2016) . Although there is  an agreement on the prevention  and avoidance of disposal, there is a  continuing discussion and confusion in other EoL treatments.  There is a need for  clarification  and harmonization combining feedstock specifics , surplus food, and  food waste as a  secondary resource and its EoL treatments . As waste hierarchy is used in policies, this lack of  clarity can result in  regulation s that are not aligned, such as European marketing standards  that lead to wastage of nutritious food  that could have been prevented   .  In light of these issues, the goals of this article are as follows:   1. Summarize current food waste terminology and definiti ons and propose a clear - cutting categorization for the various types of food waste, losses and surpluses  Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 6   2. Update the food waste hierarchy and link it to the categories  of food  waste developed  in    3. Introspect current policies and framework affecting food surplus and waste circular  economy efforts in the European Union and their relation to strong and weak  sustainability   4. Propose a framework for food waste management in a circular economy in the context  of strong sustainability, complementing the existi ng one for non -organic waste   2. Definitions   2.1 Food waste according to regulation and science community   As many times pointed out, the definitions of food waste differ significantly in the literature  and require harmonization in order to accomplish effici ent quantification to assess the  wastage of food (Hamilton et al., 2015;  Thyberg and Tonjes, 2016;  Xue et al ., 2017;   Hartikainen et al., 2018, EC, 2018 ). The difference in the definitions result s in a wide range  of food waste estimates   with limited comparability and usefulness in  relation to measuring the distance to SDG 12.3 . Several initiatives attempted to harmonize  methodologies and definitions for FW, such as the FUSIO NS quantification manual    , the REFRESH project  , FLW    through its  ―FLW quantification ranking tool‖, and Champions 12.3, which inc ludes  monitoring indicators to achieve SDG 12.3   .  In Europe, definitions from European policies are considered vague and left to interpretation  by the Member States in order to  adapt  them for  national circumstances and priorities   . To illustrate this lack of harmonization, a key EU  directive , namely the Waste Framework Directive  does not Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 7   differentiate FW from other types of organic waste  (European  Parliament, 2008) .  A recent study by the International Food Policy  Research Institute  highlights the  urgency for common  definitions throughout the whole food supply chain    including  pre-harvest losses  . Among others , the distinction between agricultural waste  and food waste needs to be clearer, as to how exactly these wastes differ and in this respect  how to refine definitions to eliminate their overlap. As stated in the widely used definition of  the landmark EU-funded project FUSIONS, pre -harvest waste (including ―not mature‖ crops  and dead animals) does not coun t as food waste, meaning that  all pre-harvest waste is  quantified as agricultural waste  .  Yet, animals and fish can be consumed before they reach maturity  for the market they are  intended . Hartikainen et al.   argue that these  should be counted as  food waste as they  can be slaughtered at any stage of maturity and used for food   .  The study also argues that the inedible part should not be included in the food waste  definition.  One rationale for this is that only edible parts of food can be considered for  prevention and redistribution to malnourished.  However, there is no universal standard of  what is edible and w hat is not. Distinguishing inedibility and edibility is rather  subjective and  differs not only from country to country but, also by consumer‘s preference. For example,  dishes prepared from chicken feet are consumed in Asian regions while in European  countr ies it is generally considered inedible. Within the same region, kiwi peels may be eaten  by some individuals while being consider ed inedible by others.  The common terminology  should support both  social and environmental goals, distinguishing edible , which  is meant for  prevention and redistribution to malnourished , and inedible  for further  EoL valorization , such  as animal feed or bio -based product s. Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 8   2.2 Clarifying terminology   A variety of  terms have been used to describe waste in connection to food, in particular , the  terms  ―food loss‖, ―food waste‖, and ―surplus food‖. The most common definition of these  three main terms and their connection to the FSC are represented in Table 1. Here, five stages  of the FSC  are distinguished : agricultural production , post-harvest  activities , processing and  manufacturing, retail and wholesale, consumption and services.  Agricultural production  consist s of pre -harvest primary production, which is  usually excluded from food waste, as  only post-harvest activities are include d.  Food loss often refer s to the post-harvest  and processing stage (FAO, 2011;  Thyberg and  Tonjes, 2016) , but sometimes  include s food loss at any stage of the FSC that is still suitable   for human consumption, albeit  unmarketable for aesthetic reasons  . It can  refer to an unintentional loss in quality or quantity. However, the term  ―food waste a nd loss‖  is often used as one category , therefore leading to o verlap ping (FAO, 2014 ; Girotto et al.,  2015) . The definition of food loss has major implications , as the term is  used in polici es.  Notably, the EU Common Agricultural Policy  argues that only food loss, and not FW,  is generated during primary production  . This implies that  any food items wasted at the pre -harvest /agricultural  stage would be part of food loss with no  FW reported, while ―food waste and losses‖ would be reported at the other stages.   Surplus food represent s the leftover edible food fit for human consumption. It can  often refer   to the retail and consumption stage s of the FSC  , but also to  overproduction at the agricultural  e.g. primary  production stage (Papargyropoulou et al.,  2014) . Parts of the surplus food and food loss become food waste either due to naturally  inedible parts or to un consumed parts that degrade  .  Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 9   Institutions and scientific communit ies use the term s food ―surplus‖, ―loss‖ and ―waste‖  presented in Table 1 to form boundaries and scope for research methodologies and  accounting, as presented in Table 2. Different boundaries for the terms and definitions of  food waste lead to results that are very challenging to compare  or use to feed action plans or  specific interventions .  From this  point onwards, the acronym FSWL  will be used to represent the overall food  surplus, losses and waste .   Here, this work propose s that surplus food only encompass es the nutritional surp lus of  food  fit for human consumption , to reflect that people are inclined to eat leftovers, but less likely  to eat what is considered ―waste‖ . Even though surplus food is ori ginating primarily after the  agricultur al stage, there are cases when food can be consumed prior to post -harvest activities,  such as consumption  of not -mature animal mentioned by Hartikainen et al. .  Food  waste is the n food that cannot be expected to be eaten by humans, due to either natural  inedibility or inedibility due to the management of food, throughout whole FSC as proposed  in IFPRI   and Bellemare et al.  . In this context,  and in the perspective of  complete material flow assessments,  food loss should only refer to the streams that are truly  lost, i.e. inexplicable, whether because  ―not accounted for‖ or disappearing from the  accounting. Examples include the discrepancies of the FW stream when transporting food  items .       3. Clarifying and updating hierarchy  for food surplus, waste and loss   3.1 Expanding the levels of the waste hierarchy   The waste hierarchy is built upon strategies introduced in the 1970s by the European  Parliament‘s Directive on Waste   and the European Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 10   Commission‘ s Second Environment Action Program  , later  refined into the  waste hierarchy in the EU‘s legislation  .  The waste hierarchy provides a guide to choose the most environmentally -efficient  EoL  treatment   . Since the hierarchy is a very general way for  prioritization of EoL treatment, actors and institutions can interpret its meaning in different  ways to achieve their goals , which is mainly a consequence of the  unspecific terms used in  the hierar chy. For instance, feeding to animals can belong to the reuse  and recycling  category, and bio-based products can belong to both recycling and recovery (UNEP, 2014;   Bernstad Saraiva Schott et al., 2013) . Moreover, EUROSTAT states ―the only reasonable  treatment of b iowaste is comp osting or anaerobic digestion‖   .  This assumption points towards a  lack of databases for sharing waste information and  technologies. Adopting a separated waste hierarchy for F SWL is perceived as promising to  increase the efficiency of prevention and reuse (European Of Court Auditors, 2016;  Wunder  et al., 2018) , but has not been adopted by the new Waste Framework Directive (Official  Journal of the European Union, 2018) .  As for the waste hierarchy, prevention is found on top of the FSWL pyramid. This means that  the greatest efforts are to be placed on keeping edible food edible.  Prevention can be achieved  via various pathways at the  source either through better logistics and management tools  , or targeting consumer‘s education, behavior, and  consumption habits   . In  particular, these efforts are to be  targeted first and foremost on the most resource -intensive  and polluting food items, in particular , red meat and dairy products  (Hedenus et al., 2014;   Stoll-Kleemann and O‘Riordan, 2015 ; Searchinger et al., 2019) . In other words, it weight s  more to prevent e.g. beef to reach the FSWL management chain than preventing e.g.  vegetables to reach the FSWL.  Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 11   The second level represents  reuse  for human consumption . Surplus food is the only fraction  that can be directly reuse d for human consumption  and is often part of  the prevention  strategies or studies  . Due to food‘s highly degradable  nature,  reuse of surplus food is tied to strict safety and hygiene norms, which can limit the  quantity of reused food and by consequence increase FW .  As the animal feed sector has its own food safety rules, it  is a distinct re use category , coming  after re use for humans for obvious ethical reasons . In this perspective, the vi sion is that  surplus food is re used exclusively for humans, while food waste may be re -used by animals  .  The safety  precautions for  reusing food waste for animal feed  needs  to ensure prevention of incidents, such as  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy  and foot  and mouth disease   . The  European Commission has recently p ublished the Guidelines for FW to animal feed (EC,  2018b) , with a restriction on the reuse  of the meat waste and its residues . If this fraction  would be  heat-treated it could be used for feed ing omnivorous non -ruminants (Wunder et al.,  2018)  increasing considera bly the amount of animal feed  available . Heat -treatment can be  expensive and if not incentivi zed, the application of other cheaper technologies will be  prioritized by the industry,  such as incentivized biomass to energy   . The  latter is often  a consequence of  targets to reach high shares of overall renewable energy ( in  Europe: 20% by 2020 and 32% by 203 0)  .  Moving down the hierarchy, ―recovery‖ and ―recycling‖ are often used interchangeably even  though they are two separate categories. For example, anaerobic digestion  is sometimes  included in recovery   and other times in  recycling  . As AD involves not only biogas but also digestate  production , it is  considered by the EU waste legislation as a recycling valorization  . Re -Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 12   distribution of food is sometimes referred to as ―recovery‖  , while FW  used as animal feed can be counted as ―recycling‖  .  Therefore, nutrient and energy recovery are to be in two separate categories for the reason  that these are two distinct services with foreseen differentiated importance in the future.   Especially in the context of safe operatin g space , where biogeochemical flow boundary of  nitrogen cycle has been already surpassed  , and the concerns about  the depletion of phosphate ro ck  . The specific case  is anaerobic  digestion  of food waste, which provides both  fertilizer (as degassed biomass  e.g.  digestate ) and en ergy ,  and therefore can fit either of the  categories . Here , the intended service of AD , i.e. the one that justifies  why AD takes place, should be the one determining to which categor y AD belong s (for the  case considered) . As the digestate  represent s a large portion of the material output, about 80%  of incoming biomass   , it is considered primarily as  nutrient recovery if applied as fertilizer. If fertilizer is not applied due to various reason, such  as local regulation th en AD belong s to energy recovery.  Further,  food waste is regarded as a  secondary material resource for the economy, just as plastic, glass or metal scraps. T his  means  that e.g. ―recycling‖ refers to material recycling that does not involve complete  degradation  as is the case of energy and nutrient recovery. In doing so, recycling then targets  products that can be re -introduced into the economy, taking into acc ount economic value,  such as market price . Including the economic value into the hierarchy  has been urged by a  number of economists  . Thus ,  recycling  consider s higher -value products, such as  bio-based chemicals and product s that  range around 1 -50,000  USD/kg  , but excludes  fertilizer, compost  and other land application valorization with low er economic value  and/or market size . In a  nutshell, surplus food is prevented  first, followed by reuse for human consumption , Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 13   while food waste is considered for reuse for animal feed , to be prioritized over the  material recycling,  followed by the nutrient recovery, and finally used for the energy  recovery, with the disposal avoided.  These suggestions are represented as a revised food  waste  pyramid in Figure 1.     3.2 Categorization  of food surplus , waste and losses   Depending on the ambient conditions and food‘s nature some part s of the food are bound to  become a waste. However, there is a difference between natural inedibility of food, such as  bones and pits, and inedibility as a consequence of food degradation, such as rotten food.  Both cannot be expected to be eaten by humans, but while the first one cannot be avoided, the  second one can be avoided  to some extent, making it partly avoidable.   Table 1 provided a clarified overview of the terminology used  for FSWL, its use in earlier  studies in Table 2 . Using these definitions further, a matrix  is developed , Table 3 , connecting  FSWL  to the conce pts of edibility and avoidance . This allows categorizing  of FSWL  according to six useful and distinct categories.  Category  I encompasses all edible food  that is  fit for human consumption ; hence the  surplus food. Category II cannot be avoided  due to  foods natural inedibility . Category III , on the other hand,  can be minimized by process - optimization , though  it also cannot be avoided  fully. Categories IV and V  cover cases where   inedibility cannot be avoided completely, due to food‘s high perishability  or due  to unpredicted conditions . Especially when  transporting or dealing with large quantities, some of the food is bound to be damaged. Such  waste can include mold formation due to inappropriate storage, defects from handling, etc.   Further, category V is differentiating the situations where  the lack of resource s (poor  functioning of the FSC)  prevent s efficient management  to those where inefficient  management is due to negligence . The  former are the situation s where the actors cannot  easily make a direct chang e, due to the unavailability of appropriate infrastructure, cold Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 14   storage, institutional and legal frameworks, etc.  (mostly, but no t exclusively, associated with  monetary resources) . The latter situation represents cases where actors have all the reso urces  to implement changes, but edible  food has been spoiled, damaged, or left uneaten after  preparation.  Finally, t he last category   belongs to previously discussed loss or ―amounts  not accounted for‖.     Surplus food  can be decreased on each level of the FSC   and thus  prevented , while food was te cannot. At the consumer stage, ―partly avoidable ‖  food waste can be defined on the basis of consumer habits, such as bread crumbs or potato  peels  that are  naturally edible  and therefore it is considered as surplus food. On the retail  stage of the FSC, surplus food is often not re -distributed in time due to transportation and  distribution costs , despite the best prevention efforts. In fact, most food items need to be  reuse d immediately, but the distribution usually waits until the quantity of food is high   enough to cover the costs/generate a profit  . Therefore, when  prevention  fails, surplus food    becomes  food waste   .   The inedible fraction of food  represents a big potential for material  recycling, which can be seen from the increased interest from the scientific community on  industrial use of food waste as a secondary resource input for biorefineries ( Mirabella et al.,  2014;  Galanakis, 2012) . Material recycling is unlikely to happen for consumer mixed waste  as these streams are would require heavy processing t o extract higher value products. In the  perspective of material recycling, avoidable and partly avoidable waste is thus interesting due  to large quantities of homogeneous waste that can be used as a secondary resource.  According to the hierarchy presented in Figure 1, material recycling should be considered as  a preferred treatment for food waste when it cannot be used for animal feed. Hence,  developing strategies for recovering streams from unavoidable  and partly  unavoidable  food waste could generate economic and environmental Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 15   benefits as these streams are always present.  For instance, in the unforeseen event of a storm  or a frost, large amounts of category IV waste could be generated which could feed existing  mater ial recycling facilities. The use of category V waste for material recycling appears less  plausible, though not to be excluded the moment large quantities are generated.  In some  cases, partly avoidable FW may be reduced upon intensifying short value chains  (Kneafsey et  al., 2013;   Michalopoulos, 2018) , as exemplified in the Horizon 2020 project DECISIVE   .  4. Ensuring regenerative circular bioeconomy for FSWL   4.1 Importance of s trong sustainability  for the target goals and decision -making   Re-introducing and re -circulating streams through the economy also  referr ed to as  closing the   material & resource flow  loop, is generally perceived as sustainable . Yet,  there is a need to  differentiate weak and strong sustainability , and to  anticipate externalities in the future  circular economy  .   Sustainability science and industrial ecology often distinguish between natural, human, and  manufactured capital, and a large body of work ha ve studied their interrelations  (Weisz et al.,  2015) . In a nutshell, manufactured capital  represents material goods, services, or  infrastructu re beyond those found directly in nature , while natural capital encompasses  natural resources  and ecosystem services.  Alongside these terms, sustainability science also  distinguishes between strong and weak sustainability. Weak sustainability    sees nat ural  and manufacture d capital a s substitutable, strong sustainability   sees them  as  complementary  and highlights the need to conserve critical natural capital  (Pelenc and Ballet,  2015;  Ang and Van Passel, 2012) .  Prevention and environmental impacts are difficult to translate into economic measures as  opposed to direct economic saving s. Therefore, regulatory instruments are needed to enforce Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 16   the changes towards strong sustainability  to ensure strong sustainable development,  restoration and conservation of natural resources by staying inside the ecological ceiling o f a  safe operating space for humanity (MEA, 2006; R ockström et al., 2009; EU, 2018,  Decision  No 1386/2013/EU ; European Parliament, 2013) . One example of such regulatory instruments  is the use of  taxes and subsidies  as proposed by The Lancet Commission   and IPCC   . Specific examples of measures affected by these taxes and subsidies include:   sustainable  cultivation of crops and their inclusion into health y diets; subsidies for purchase  of suboptimal  food or its sale  in separate category in shops  for  lower prices  ; donations of food for food banks (Searchinger  et al., 2019) , and general prioritization  of restorative business models; and payment for  ecosystem s ervices  .  Kummu et al.   argued that around 20% of the total use of water, cropland and  fertilizers are used to produce surplus food  ending as food waste, which  could have been  avoided upon adopti ng environmental and social ly responsible business models according to  the strong sustain ability principles.  Effective  application of SDG   12.3 on surplus food prevent ion would imply  a need  for policy regulations t hat incentivize  the implementation of upcycling technologies ensuring  that the exchange s between the  technosphe re and the natural environment lead to healthy ecosystems.  This touches upon  SDG 3.9  that calls fo r a reduction in the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous  chemicals and air, wa ter, and  soil pollution and contamination. The vision is that the  implementation of upcycling technologies needs an integrated plan for eliminating micro - pollutants and  their recirculation or concentration back to the technosphere . Conservation of  healthy soil ecosystems  is needed to avoid externalities on human  health connected to  the micro -pollutants exposure, such as heavy -metals (Thomsen et al.,   2012 ; Pizzol et al., 2014) . Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 17   Yet, to be more than a mere concept, SS needs to be measured , which in turns requires  metrics and indicators. The European Union plans to develop indicators for measuring  resource efficiency in the circular economy, including food waste  .  To this end, t he conventional use of current EU‘s waste codes  by the Member States  is not sufficient , as it does not captures separate categories and classification o f FW and  therefore must be expanded and updated to improve FW data in EU‘s Member States . Further  support in de cision -making was suggested by the Co mmission  as a way to monitor the  progress of Circular Economy by means of  ten indicators divided into four thematic areas :  Production and Consumption;  Waste management ; Secondary raw materials ; and  Competitiveness and Innovation  . All four areas  can help to a ddress FSWL   and monitor its use as a secondary resource. For instance, the thematic area Secondary raw  materials consist of  three indicators  that can help integrate FW into CE : 1) Contribution of  recycled materials to raw materials demand, 2) Circular mate rial use rate, 3) Trade -in  recyclable raw material .  4.2 Ensuring strong sustainability in EU’s legislation   In the EU, until very recently, FSWL  as a policy issue was not explicitly defined and  there fore neither properly addressed   .  The Landfill Directive is a driver for putting the waste hierarchy  forward , while the Waste  Framework Directive is the cornerstone of the Circular Economy. The largest step in  recognizing the food waste issue was the adopti on of a key non -legislative act , namely  the  Roadmap for a resource -efficient Europ e in 2011, which established that ―by 2020  the  disposal of edible food waste should have been halved in the EU‖  ; now expressed  in the SDG 2030 target 12.3  for the whole world . More recently, the Circular Economy  Package included legislative proposals on food waste  , as part of mobilizing the  actions for the reduction of FSWL and its use as a secondary resource.  While t he Circular Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 18   Economy Policy Package    aims to close material loops through the r ecycling and  reuse of products , the Bioeconomy Strategy    is a research and innovation vision  aimed at enhancing the exploitation of b iomaterials while restoring natural resources and  ecosystem health.  It has recently been suggested to combine these two strategies into the  concept of ―Circular Bioeconomy‖  . A circular bioeconomy would address  ecosystem health -restoring resource flows,  biodiversity aspects and nutrient cycles , local  FSC  and biorefineries to diversify income and contribute to the substitution of  emission -intensive  fossil -based production systems by biobased chemicals , ingredients and products (EEA,  2018) . The European Commission intend s to implement authorization procedures for over a  hundred of safe recycling processes including food contact materials to ensure  food safety  and reduce food waste  . Table 4 provides examples of frameworks and policies  that have taken steps towards strong sustainability when it comes to FSWL throughout the  FSC.  A more detaile d overview of policies that touch upon FSWL has been provided by the  EU project REFRESH  , focusing on SDG 12.3 . (INSERT Table 4  HERE)   Furthermore, while many of the currently used quantification s are proxy from  the project   FUSIONS   , there are some quantification estimates from  Portugal   , Italy   , France    , and Hungary  , and the estimates using 2010  values from Eurobarometer  . This highlights the need for  more  recent quantifications  at national level , especially in light of the prevention efforts.  Even though the generation of food waste is predicted to rise, prevention can be efficient in  decreasing food waste, as proven by the example  of the United Kingdom  (Searchinger et al.,  2019 ; Lipinski et al. 2013). T here are several examples of governmental initia tives in EU -28  to decrease FSWL , see Table 5 . Italian legislation focuses  on food donation throughout the Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 19   whole  FSC  . Denmark (Danish Veterianry and Food  Administration, 2017) , Belgium   and France   concentrate on  retail level , even though French legislation support s battle against food waste overall with  ―Loi N. 2016 -138 du 11 fevrier 2016 relative a la lutte contre le gaspillage alimentaire‖   . Several states , such as  Germany,  Portugal , and Hungary ,  suppo rt tax deduction on  food donation  .      4.3 Proposal of circular economy pathways   Expanding commonly used figure  for the circular economy  (see Figure 6 in Ellen MacArthur  Foundation, 2013) , which is coherent for materials like electric and electronic waste ,  closing the loop for FSWL engages all levels of FSC . Figure 2, represents the summary of  possible circular pathways within the FSC. It distinguishes inedible and edible fractions for  EoL options , in accord ance with  the updated food waste hierarchy .  The pre - condition for edible streams  to enter the framework of Figure 2 is that  prevention of  becoming food surplus failed. Edible surplus food is proposed for  the reuse mostly at the  consumption & service stage , retail stage ( when food is div erted directly from  retailers to the secondary retailer  such as Wefood in Denmark  ), but also at  the consumption and service stage  .  Inedible food waste that can be used for animal feed m ay stem from the agricultural   production , post-activities , or processing & manufacturing stage a s illustrated on the right - hand side by dotted lines.  All other inedible streams are generated and recirculated at all  stages of the FSC, where recirculation op tions involving material recycling   have precedence over  those going straight to nutrient and  energy recovery  . For  instance, large quantities of mango peels from mango processing can be used as semolina for  pasta  . Tomato processing waste can be used for carotenoids production, a Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 20   colorant that extends the shelf -life of food and has many health benefits (Strati and  Oreop oulou, 2014) .   The vision of F igure 2 is to illustrate how the various stages of the FSC can generate and use  FSWL, and how it can be linked to the food waste hierarchy proposed in Figure 1 and the  notion of edibility.  It should also be highlighted that  although the inedible streams can be  used for material recycling within the FSC as illustrated in Figure 2, they can also be used for  materials outside the FSC, e.g. as bioplastics   , shoes (Piñatex™ in  Ramchandani and Coste -Maniere, 2018) , or chemicals  . (INSERT Figure 2  HERE)   In order to prevent eventual rebound effects, i.e. not to encourage any additional generation  of FSWL  as input to feedstock -dependent biorefineries  , there is a need  to establish distinct degrees of priorities  for inedible streams, for which the FSWL categories  are very useful . The priorities are illustrated in Figure 3. The vision is to ensure that  additional FSWL generation is prevented, there fore the partly avoidable food waste streams   are found at the  bottom . Streams, such as those stemming from dairy and red meat productio n  represent the lowest priority  . The rationale is the same as explained for prevention  in the food waste pyramid , namely to target the most resource -intensive and  polluting food items  like those for which preventing rebound effect s is the most important.   Waste com ing from processing industry   may be more interesting for biorefineries, given the potential volumes and uniform streams it  can generate, hence it is proposed as priority 1 and 2. The vision is that priori ty 2 and 3   streams enter biorefineries only after enforcing optimization efforts to minimize their  generation in the first place.   Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 21   5. Discussion   5.1 Limitations   5.1.1 The challenge of measuring  FSWL   Our work introduced several new terms to make it easier to deal with food waste in the  upcoming era of the circular economy. Yet, the boundaries of wording clarification and  concepts categorization must also meet those of  quantification when it comes to  implementing concrete policies  and evaluate their efficiency .  Up till now, consistently with the famous adage ―you cannot manage what cannot be  measured‖, most studies have focused on quantifiable recycling and recovery strategies   . The complexity of quantifyi ng  prevention, the top priority policy -wise, has already been acknowledged.  In fact, it has been  highlighted as the least measurable among the waste hierarchy treatments  .  Prevention from the primary production to the retail can be achieved by  more efficient  management. However, the consumer stage is pa rticularly challenging to influence and  measure as it involves many factors that interact together. These factors include economic  motives, soci al drivers and cultural pressure as well as individual preference s. While  economic reasons, e.g. saving money, are a driving force for behavioral change (Thyberg and  Tonjes, 2016) , socio -psychological motivations, such as conservatism, misinformation and  bureaucratic resistance, can rep resent up to 40% of difficulties for waste prevention   . Economic factors are further influenced by geographic, cultural,  political and personal reasons linked to food waste generation  ,  with different countries having different waste generation patterns.  This being said,  Searchinger et al.  highlighted different generic easy -to-operate strategies for  prevention, such as smaller portion sizes in r estaurants at a different price, and avoiding Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 22   misleading ―sell by‖ dates in retail stores , as already practi sed in the United Kingdom    .  Distinguishing the terms proposed in Tab le 3 can be a challenging task, mainly surplus food,  and partly avoidable food. As surplus food refer s to edible food this varies per region as well  as per individual preference. Each country and region have their  own eating habits and partly  avoidab le food waste can largely vary.   Therefore,  countries should aim to make a list of inedible items considered inedible by the  majority in order to improve the quantifications of the waste. For instance, by  engaging  expert s and performing questio nnaires for consumer preference. This should be parallel with  developing an understanding of where and why FSWL occurs  as highlighted by Searchinger  et al.  . Generally , being non-digestible by humans is a valid criteria for  inedib ility,  such as pits and bones, but there are food items that are known to be eaten by some while not- eaten by others .  If incentives should be  established to reduce this stream at the consumer level, clear boundaries at the management  scale   would need to be established, along with clear measurement metrics.   Quantifications of the consumers waste can sometimes be based on consumer‘s data such as  diaries, weighting, source separation and similar, therefore consumers understanding of the  definitions is important . Using the term surplus food with the  clarification of how it differs  from food waste is highly relevant to increase the reuse  by humans  .  Accordin g to th e results of the study by  Papargyropoulou et al.  , the distinction  between ―surplus food‖ and ―food waste‖ is also an important food security issue.  Food loss,  on the other hand, was here defined by its intrinsic ch aracteristic of never been measured . By  using very efficient quantification methods food loss is ideally zero , with all surplus food Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 23   redistributed and reused, and all food waste reused for animal feed, material recycling, or  nutrient and energy recovery.   5.1.2 Interpreting the proposed framework s for multi -valuable output processes   Proposed FSWL  hierarchy  , updated circular economy model , and  prioritization for the use of FW in CE  are guidance tools,  and as often the case  with such tools, generic rules covering all cases are almost impossible to establish.  While  material recycling prime s over nutrient and energy recovery, i n practice , exceptions should be  allowed. W ith a pr oper evaluation to confirm t he ―exception‖  status , other options might be  more environmental . FSWL is not independent of the developments happening in the other  sectors of society and should not be considered in silo. This can especially be the case when  cascading production takes place  and multiple outputs challenge  the priorities presented in  our proposed FSWL hierarchy  . For instance, a certain food waste stream may be  driven to AD as a result of increasing investments into renewable gas triggered by other  streams,  although energy recovery comes at the bottom of the FSWL pyramid. Such case is  not necessarily to proscribe, especially taking into account that it also generate s a digestate  that can be refined into e.g. biopesticides (Cerda et al., 2019 ; here considered as material  recycling ). The gas may similarly be refined into plat form molecules for e.g. the chemical  sector.  Another example  of multi -functional EoL technologies  generating environmentally - valuable co -products  can include those where  biochar   and/or activated  carbon   are generated, such as pyrolysis . The activated carbon  and biochar   can uptake  heavy metals, thereby improving the regenerative nature and health of the soil.  According to IPCC  , certain biochars can be used not only for carbon sequestration,  but also to improve water holding capacity and nu trient use efficiency in soil, and even  increase the yield  . However, any management strategies for FSWL would  need to Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 24   be evaluated by tools such as life cycle assessment to prove their environmental performance  when compared to the alternative  treatments , within a specific context .  5.1.3 Food waste categories   Some streams may be seen as classifiable into more than one of the categories presented in  Table 3. For instance, orange peels stemming from juice production could belong to  categori es II and III at the same time. But peels being inherently inedible belong to category  II. This could pose problems in an accounting context and would require further  categorization principles. For instance, it could be decided to classify unavoidable food  waste  streams into category II first, and then category III . Additional work could also  consider combining  these catego ries with the stages of the FSC in a step -wise decision tree  for classifying FSWL.   5.2 Time dimension: short  value chains  for FSWL management   As FSWL is highly degradable, short management cycles are of tremendous importance ,  particular ly in the context of a warmer climate  . Food waste processed   immediately , for any EoL , could  be considered as minimization of low-quality waste   generation   . Short FSWL management cycles , in fact,  prevent the degradation of  the content in the  unavoidable and partly unavoidable waste  to be  re-introduced as the new materials in the case of recyc ling FW . In the short chains, the costs  for transportation, treatment of waste, costs of raw material, energy need and others costs are  furthermore generally decreased . Short management cycles  of FSWL  are  likely to be favored in industrial symbiosis or decentralized systems where geographic  proximity allows immediate use of the waste fraction . Examples are presented in   , among others . On the prevention side, Searchinger et al.  propose  to establish additi onal local food banks combined with third -party scheduled retrieval Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 25   services making re -distribution shorter and easier from farms and retail stores to food banks.  Internet apps informing food banks of the availability of surplus food in near -real time do  exist   and can further enhance the efficiency of this prevention strategy.   5.3 Perspectives   Our analysis of selected European framework and policies showed th at steps towards SS have  been taken, but need further refining  to achieve  SS in  the European law. For instance,  decreasing waste of animal origin needs  improved legislation on its re use (European Council,  2009) , while CE derived fertilizer need s stronger limits for heavy metal content to ensure  healthy soil systems  . EU-wide  initiatives, such as  the circular economy indicators mentioned in Table 4   and  initiatives mentioned in T able 5 , are helping to promote FSWL prevention, reuse, recycling  and recovery on each stage of the FSC.   Further, there is an issue with the meaning of the word prevention . The Waste Framework  Directive defines prevention as ―measures taken before a substance, material or product has  become waste, that reduce s  the quantity of waste, including through the reuse of products  or the extension of the life span of products  the adverse impacts of the generated w aste on  the environment and human health…‖  . Strictly applying this  official definition implies that  using FW directly in the short -chains ( e.g. in the industrial  symbiosi s) can be counted as prevention , i.e. preventing ―waste‖ usable for applications at the  top of the hierarchy pyramid to become waste of lower quality for use at the bottom of the  pyramid . A distinction between the two types of prevention (of beco ming FSWL in the first  place, and  becoming food waste of lower quality  than already is ) could be the topic for  more  exploration . As highlighted throughout this study, definitions need to be very clear and  transparent in order to support the strong  sustainable circular economy.  Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 26   The suggested clarified food waste hierarchy and closed -loop framework, as well as our  proposed categories of food , are seen as important stepping stones towards sustainable  management of FSWL. These categories can provide business and po licy decision support on  how to reach the SDG 12.3 2030 target and further transition towards the circular economy. It  can be further used by policy -makers and managers to prioritize the efforts, and analyze the  trends and efficiency of the circular econom y in Europe for food waste.   6. Conclusion   This article has summarized , categorized and clarified the common definitions and terms for  food waste . The term ―food  loss‖  is proposed  to only refer to  ―not accounted for‖, ―surplus food‖ to all edible food fit for  human consumption and the rest belonging to ―food waste‖. Introducing the term surplus  food into the waste hierarchy  has been stressed out as important for prevention and  reuse of  food for hum an consumption.   Three useful tools that can improve quantification methods have been introduced  1) Category  matrix for FSWL 2) Updated food waste hierarchy and 3) Circular economy framework for  FSWL . Linking  edibility and degree of possible avoidance resulted in six  categories for food ,  which can be used to measure FSWL more efficiently  and contribute to knowledge on  unavoidability/edibility of the waste at each part of the FSC.  The levels of the food waste  hierarchy  have been expanded  by material recy cling  due to economic potential of  unavoidable food waste , with nutrient and energy r ecovery as separate categories due to  importance of addressing nitrogen flows and other nutrient s. These clarified EoL treatments  can support faster intervention , which is  critical for highly perishable wastage . In strong  sustainability context, the  prioritization framework for the use of FSWL into biorefin eries  was introduced . This article  stressed -out that emission intensity of food waste prevention or Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proof 27   used for biorefiner ies should also be considered.  CE framework can improve and uncover  valorization of food wa ste in the supply chain, with  many examples sho wcasing closed -loop  pathways  included.   Proper implementation of transparent FSWL valorization need s to be supported by policies.   Even though steps towards SS have been taken, mostly by launching of the Circular  Economy framework and to some extent the Bioeconomy Strategy , policies need to be  harmonized towards the common goal of prevention and EoL accor ding to the FSWL  hierarchy . Implementation of the proposed tools can help to  harmonize objectives of  reduction and  regulation of  FSWL  in policies.
