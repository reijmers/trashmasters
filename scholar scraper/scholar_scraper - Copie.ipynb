      "This could contribute in empirically identifying the waste ﬂows\n",
      "with the most promising CE valorisation potential for cities such\n",

      "The datasets we developed enabled us to perform waste-type,\n",
      "sector- and treatment-speciﬁc analyses of urban waste ﬂows.Compared with conventional EW-MFAs based on statistical data,\n",
      "the urban waste metabolism presented in this study is more\n",

      "However, this increase in detail comes at a cost; the procedures\n",
      "of data conversion, alignment and disaggregation inherently\n",
      "resulted in additional uncertainties. Highest uncertainties occur\n",
      "for metals, glass and inert waste amounts and their distribution\n",
      "over economic sectors.\n",
      "Furthermore, a general limitation of the approach is that the\n",
      "starting point is the amount of collected waste and not the amount\n",
      "of used products. Thus, the role of CE measures based on products\n",

      "reduced by extending the waste input-output framework to phys-\n",

      "tion growth, political strife, rapid urbanization, food and water scarcity, environmental pollution, infectious diseases, and climate change. In this turbulent era, there is a need for resilience at every level—from the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We argue that achieving resilience will require both enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to these chal-lenges. Such practical first steps can serve as models for creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in India. One way to stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials, thus seeking to eliminate waste. Previous research has shown that such initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community resilience, while stimulating the regional economy. An international conference on Waste Management Innovation, held in 2017 in Mumbai with funding from the US Consulate General, resulted in the award of seed grants to two Indian non-profits that sought to apply circular economy principles to regional communities—one urban and one rural. These initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation. The World Institute of Sustainable Energy has developed an action plan to capture at least 60 percent of the electronic waste generated in the city of Pune, one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. Their approach is based on circular economy principles, and has been embraced in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents and non-governmental organizations. Barefoot College has established and demonstrated a low-cost, end-to-end solid waste management model for rural villages that is designed by the local community. Their unique approach ensures sanitation, environmental protection, income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. This paper presents the results of these two efforts, and suggests what lessons were learned. One overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is necessary to understand the interplay of economic, environmental, and social forces.\n",

      "In recent years, the rapid growth of the Indian economy has been accompanied by an array of social and environmental stress factors, including population growth, political strife, rapid urbanization, food and water scarcity, environmental pollution, and climate change. By 2050, half of India’s popu-lation will live in cities, and municipal solid waste volume is expected to triple to about 436 million metric tons (MT) (Lal 2013).

      "development and ineffective regulatory controls. Moreover, the focus on long-term sustainability is often trumped by social and political turbulence, as well as unexpected dis-ruptions such as terrorism, industrial accidents and extreme weather events.

      "tunately, the adverse impacts of these stress factors will dis-proportionately affect the informal sectors of the economy where hundreds of millions of lower-caste workers struggle to support themselves and their families.\n",
      "In this time of disruptive change, there is a clear need \n",
      "for resilience at every level—from the peasant family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We define resilience as “the capacity for a system to survive, adapt, and flourish in the face of turbulent change and uncertainty” (Fiksel 2015). In the context of economic development, the \n",
      "“system” is extremely complex, since it involves produc-ers, supply chains, consumers, waste handlers, regulators, and non-governmental organizations that may be located in different geographic zones. Moreover, a true systems view must consider the social and environmental consequences of remaining in the current state, the potential benefits to vari-ous stakeholders of proposed adaptations, and the accom-panying uncertainties.\n",
      "Resilience is often confounded with sustainability. The \n",
      "two concepts are closely related, but quite different in scope and time scale. Sustainability represents a long-term view, considering how decisions that we make today will influence \n",

      "Generally speaking, we can say that a sustainable system \n",
      "is more resilient to disruptions and a resilient system is more sustainable in the long run. In other words, sustainability and resilience are distinct but mutually reinforcing. However, sustainability and resilience may not always be synergistic. There are situations where sustainability and resilience are opposing rather than reinforcing. For example, by storing backup supplies, a company may improve business conti-nuity but this also increases the environmental footprint. In the Indian context, we argue that both resilience and sus-tainability can be achieved by a combination of enlightened government policies based on systems thinking, as well as successful initiatives by social and environmental innova-tors. These practical first steps can serve as models to be replicated, thus defining a path forward toward a resilient and sustainable Indian economy.\n",
      "Waste management challenges in India\n",
      "For purposes of achieving both sustainability and resilience, a critical area that must be addressed in India is the man-agement of municipal, industrial and agricultural wastes in both urban and rural areas. As of 2016, urban areas in India, representing about 377 million people, generated 62 mil-lion MT of municipal solid waste each year. Of this, only about 70% are collected due to insufficient municipal ser -\n",
      "vices. About 20% of the collected wastes are treated, and the remaining 50% are disposed in open landfills, without proper treatment or containment. Based on changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth, urban municipal solid waste generation is projected to reach 165 million MT by 2030. (India Environment Portal 2016).\n",
      "In rural areas, agricultural wastes including crop and \n",
      "animal residues are often burnt in the fields or used as tra-ditional household fuels. These practices have resulted in severe pollution of air, soil and water, creating health prob-lems for both workers and nearby households. Recycling and composting programs are unable to keep pace with the growth of waste, although small startup companies and NGOs are introducing new solutions ranging from high-tech waste processing to improve training and support for waste picker communities (Fiksel and Lal 2018).\n",
      "In theory, much of this waste could be beneficially used \n",
      "as renewable energy or materials. However, the challenges of modernizing waste collection, segregation, treatment and disposal are enormous. Following the establishment of the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Mission in 2014, a series of more stringent rules were issued in 2016 for solid waste management, including specific requirements for plas-tic wastes, electronic wastes, construction and demolition debris, biomedical wastes, and hazardous wastes. However, despite these regulatory efforts, the Indian economy will continue to generate growing waste streams due to increase in population, urbanization, crops and livestock, resulting in significant human health and environmental impacts.\n",
      "For India to achieve continued economic growth, poverty \n",
      "alleviation, hunger elimination, human development, and environmental improvement, new transformative solutions are needed rather than incremental improvements. Beyond the obvious concerns about waste proliferation, improved waste management is important for controlling a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs)—methane emissions from landfills, as well as nitrous oxide and methane from agricultural waste combustion. Moreover, material through-put is a major driver of GHG emissions, and hence waste reduction will significantly decrease energy and material demand and the associated GHG emissions throughout global supply chains (Fiksel 2011).\n",

      "Management Innovation held in Mumbai in April 2017, with the purpose of stimulating waste minimization strategies based on “circular economy” principles (OSU 2017).

The accomplish-ments of two grantee organizations are described below—one in an urban context and the other in a rural context.\n",
      "Circular economy opportunities\n",
      "The concept of “circular economy” as a strategy for waste elimination has been broadly adopted in the business world. Companies have sought to achieve “zero waste” by find-ing uses for discarded materials and closing the loop in their supply network.

In this type of holistic analysis, it is important to account for direct consequences, such as finan-cial benefits, as well as indirect or unintended consequences, including environmental and social impacts.\n",

Many existing waste streams are underutilized; for example, municipal solid waste contains about 85% of bio-mass and other combustible materials, comprising a mixture of energy-rich fuels. Likewise, coal combustion residues from power plants, such as fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization residues, can be beneficially used in concrete and cement production, structural fills, building products, gypsum wallboard, and surface stabili-zation.

      "A particularly effective circular economy practice is \n",

Stewardship of natural capital (i.e., ecological resources) and social capital (i.e., community solidarity) will help companies to achieve profitable waste reduction or avoidance in ways that not only benefit their shareholders and business partners but also earn the respect and appreciation of public stakeholders. Thus, judicious management of all waste sources (industrial, agri-cultural and municipal) can advance progress toward many of the UN SDGs. In particular, circular economy practices will contribute to Goal 12—environmentally sound man-agement of chemicals and wastes, including reduction in releases, and Goal 3—ensuring healthy lives and well-being, including reduction in deaths and illnesses due to environ-mental pollution.\n",

India generates an estimated 1.6 MMT per year of agri-cultural wastes, but a large proportion of these resources can be composted and used as soil amendments. With judicious use of chemical fertilizers, this would eliminate the nutrient deficit in agricultural soils while sequestering carbon and improving the health of soil, plants, animals, people and the environment. Agricultural wastes can also be utilized as industrial raw materials; for example, rice husk ash is a valuable industrial raw material for steel, cement, and refractory bricks, and can also be used for waste water treatment, thermal insulation, mortar and con-crete production, soil amendment, and silica production. Similarly, bagasse from sugarcane can be used to generate energy.\n",

      "The village selected for this project was Nalu, near \n",
      "the campus of Barefoot College in the Ajmer district of \n",
      "Rajasthan. The population consists of approximately 660 families comprising a total of 3000 residents. The major occupations of these villagers include farming, animal husbandry, marble industry, firework factories. Many are employed as contract laborers, including work supported by the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by provid-ing at least 100 days of wage employment per year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.\n",
      "Drinking water, electricity, education, and basic health \n",
      "facilities are available in the village. However, sanitation facilities and practices are notably deficient. Although 90% of the families have toilets, only about half of these families actually use their toilets. The rest practice open defecation in the fields, a traditional practice that they find more agreeable than being shut in a small room. Moreover, the community lacks any type of waste management system, so that most trash is simply burned or discarded in nearby fields.\n",
      "Baseline survey In January 2019, a baseline survey was \n",
      "conducted to understand the current knowledge, attitudes and practices of the community related to waste disposal and management. Each household in the village was visited to understand the general attitudes, and survey data were col-lected from 25% of the households. The survey results are shown in Fig.  5. Key findings were as follows:\n",
      "• Existing waste disposal system While organic waste and metals are largely disposed in a non-harmful manner (composting or selling), non-biodegradable waste mate-rials such as plastics, cloth, rubber are either dumped in the open or burned. These practices threaten the integrity of local soils and water bodies, and may endanger the health of both humans and grazing animals.\n",
      "• Existing cleaning arrangements Members of the “sweeper community” are forced to clean villages for low and infrequent wages. They are a marginalized and oppressed group, treated as untouchables by the rest of the village, and are not allowed to engage in other liveli-hood activities.\n",
      "• Interest in a waste management system All households agreed upon the need for a scientific waste management system and were prepared to support the system with a monthly contribution of Rs. 40 (about 60 cents) per household.\n",
      "• Stakeholder involvement The local governance body (Panchayat), consisting of influential men and women from the community, was completely aligned with the \n",

      "System design Accordingly, the Barefoot College team \n",
      "set out to design a low-cost, end-to-end rural solid waste management system with the participation of the village community, illustrated in Fig.  6. The team estimated that \n",
      "the system would employ about 2 or 3 cleanliness work -\n",
      "ers per village, and that a supervisor would be appointed in each village. Once trained, the supervisor could most likely take responsibility for 3 or 4 neighboring villages in the region.\n",
      "Implementation of this design in the village of Nalu was \n",
      "accomplished by the fall of 2019, enabling the following key activities:\n",
      "• Waste collection The cleanliness workers collect segre-gated waste from households every day. Waste is segre-gated into ‘Organic’, ‘Plastic and other recyclables’ and ‘Hazardous’ at the household level. Waste collection is accomplished using an electric-powered cart.\n",

      "• Waste treatment All waste is transported to the recy -\n",
      "cling facility for processing as follows:\n",
      "(a) Organic waste is converted into nutrient-rich com-\n",
      "post through a 3-month low-cost composting tech-nique.\n",
      "(b) Recyclable waste is further segregated into plastic bottles, plastic food packaging, polyethylene bags, cloth, glass, rubber, metal, cardboard, and other materials. Each type of waste is stored separately and sold to recycling plants periodically.\n",
      "(c) Bio-medical wastes such as sanitary pads, diapers, and blood-stained cloth are incinerated.\n",
      "(d) Any other residual waste is sent to a sanitary land-fill. After implementation of this system, less than 5% of household waste is being sent to the land-fills.\n",
      "(e) All the waste collected is weighed daily and docu-mented.\n",
      "• Waste value recovery Compost and recyclable waste are sold and the revenue generated is reinvested into the system to offset operational cost. A service charge is also collected from the village residents to ensure long-term ownership of the system.\n",
      "Implementation of this project proceeded through the \n",
      "following series of steps:\n",
      "Step 1 Community sensitization\n",
      "February and March of 2019 were spent generating \n",
      "awareness of the project and sensitizing the community \n",
      "to the importance of waste management. Focus group dis -\n",
      "cussions, mass awareness sessions using puppetry, house-hold-level awareness generation, and randomized aware-ness meetings were conducted to engage the villagers in dialogue and inform them about appropriate waste man-agement and source segregation methods. These activities included:\n",
      "• Seven informal group discussions engaging 100 people\n",
      "• Four ward level awareness presentations engaging 300 women\n",
      "• One mass awareness puppet show engaging > 500 resi-\n",
      "dents\n",
      "• Two cleaning camps in the government school involving more than 250 students\n",
      "• Sensitization workshops with a village youth group (12 members) and a group of local governance officials (nine members)\n",
      "As a result, almost every person in the village was made \n",
      "aware of the concept that was being introduced and was supportive of setting up a waste management system in the village.\n",
      "Step 2 Leadership and commitment\n",
      "In March 2019, an all-female village committee was \n",
      "formed to design, build and implement the waste man-\n",
      "agement system. This approach ensures local relevance of the design as well as long-term sustainability and owner -\n",
      "ship of the system within the community. The committee mobilized residents to contribute money toward the waste management system, and was able to raise Rs 9600 (about $640) from the local governance (Gram Panchayat), and other influential village families.\n",
      "Step 3 Recycling infrastructure.\n",
      "During April 2019, the team focused on setting up \n",
      "household infrastructure to promote source segregation. \n",
      "Discarded oil cans were refurbished to create visually appealing and functional dustbins. In a period of one month, more than 1000 s-hand oil cans were washed, painted and marked with ‘Organic waste,’ ‘Plastic and other dry waste’ and ‘Hazardous waste.’ The bins were dis-tributed to 337 households as well as the shops, schools, and other publicly used spaces in the village. This activity had the following advantages:\n",
      "• No new material was used to manufacture the dustbins, which served as a message to the community that old and discarded items can be refurbished into useful and attractive products\n",
      "• The cost per dustbin was almost half of the price to pur -\n",
      "chase new dustbins of similar quality\n",
      "• Five local people were given employment for 2 to 3 weeks for preparation of the bins.\n",
      "Step 4 Waste treatment infrastructure.\n",
      "The local governance body (Gram Panchayat) allocated \n",
      "land to the organization to build waste management infra-structure. From April to June 2019, the land was leveled, cleared of bushes, fenced, and made ready for construction. Four compost pits and one segregation and storage unit were constructed to treat all the waste generated by the village.\n",
      "Step 5 Village clean-up\n",
      "From June to August 2019, two persons from the mar -\n",
      "ginalized Dalit community in the village were selected and \n",
      "trained to carry out the activities of sanitation workers. The two workers have taken on this role as a full-time job earn-ing a regular salary. Through their efforts, all the traditional village dumping spots were cleared and have since remained clear of open dumping. A landfill was created to replace the existing dump sites.\n",

      "Step 6 Waste collection launch.\n",
      "Beginning in July 2019, door-to-door collection was ini-\n",
      "tiated using a manual cycle trolley. However, this mode of \n",
      "transport proved to be unsuccessful and laborious due to the many unpaved roads in the village. By September 2019, an electric three-wheeler was purchased, making waste col-lection much faster and easier. (See Fig.  7) More houses \n",
      "could be covered each day and the team had more time for segregation and treatment of the waste. Each household has been trained on source segregation, and mixed waste is not accepted from the households. Student volunteers were engaged in conducting awareness sessions with households to promote source segregation.\n",
      "Step 7 Waste management system\n",
      "The final step of implementation, during August to Sep-\n",
      "tember 2019, was the establishment of an ongoing system \n",
      "for treatment, storage, and recycling of the collected waste. Wet waste is composted organically in aerobic NADEP (Narayan Deotao Pandharipande) method of composting, which uses a wide range of organic materials such as crop residues, weeds, forest litter and kitchen waste with an end-product of a fertilizer that serves as a good alternative to farmyard manure. Within 3 months of filling a pit, the pit can be emptied and the compost can be used in fields. Dry waste is segregated and stored under different categories—plastics, cardboard, glass, metal, cloth, etc.—for eventual recycling.\n",
      "Step 8 Ongoing operation and monitoring.\n",
      "During the final months of the project, the operation of \n",
      "the waste management system was closely monitored by \n",
      "Barefoot College and a village-level supervisor. An ongoing process is being developed for supervision of the continued operation and maintenance of the system, including mainte-nance of the resource recovery site and overall performance tracking.\n",
      "In summary, this project was successful despite numerous \n",
      "challenges, including the following:\n",
      "• Waste management and community hygiene are not a pri-ority for village residents; hence, it is difficult to support such systems solely through community contributions.\n",
      "• Initially, the District Administration did not provide any support for this project. There was a month’s delay in obtaining the necessary documents for land allocation toward the project, which delayed the setup of infrastruc-ture.\n",
      "• Existing waste in various dumping spots around the vil-lage was an ongoing hazard, since it could not be treated or recycled.\n",
      "• Extreme weather conditions and the 2019 heat wave in Rajasthan resulted in fewer working hours per day; the team was able to work only during early morning and late evening hours.\n",
      "Notwithstanding these challenges, the project demon-\n",
      "strated the feasibility of establishing a low-cost, community-driven waste management system in rural villages within the space of one year. The beneficial impacts of this work can be summarized as follows.\n",
      "• Environmental protection All dumping areas in the vil-lage have been cleared, thus preventing animals from eat-ing plastic and other non-biodegradable waste littered on the streets. Clogged drains have been cleared of waste. Water bodies, soil, and ground water are no longer pol-\n",

      "lage hygienic and safe for living.\n",
      "• Behavioral change The 3000 village residents, including men, women and children, have been sensitized regarding appropriate waste disposal and management. Almost all households practice source segregation and have ceased dumping and burning waste in the open.\n",
      "• Livelihood generation Two persons from the village have been employed as cleanliness workers, earning a regu-lar income and considering themselves as members of a dignified occupational group with high social impact.\n",
      "• Value recovery from waste In the space of 4 months, over 1000 kg of wet waste were converted to organic com-post that is being used to nourish farmers’ soil. Approxi-mately, 50 kg of dry waste have been segregated and diverted from landfills.\n",
      "• Broader awareness Many neighboring villages have learned about this waste management model and are now demanding that it be set up in their communities as well. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Block Develop-ment Officer visited the waste management site and have expressed interest in funding replication of this project in other villages.\n",
      "It is important to ensure that these benefits are enduring \n",
      "over time, and that villagers do not revert to their previous unhygienic practices. Monitoring of the waste management system is currently being performed by the Barefoot College team and the village committee representatives. The long-term aim is to fully transition the supervision of the system to the local governance authorities in order to ensure con-tinuity and sustainability. The Barefoot College team plans to reevaluate the impact of the program after 3 years, so that they can better understand and document the impacts of the waste management system on environmental and social parameters.\n",
      "The path forward\n",
      "The conference on Waste Management Innovation and the subsequent seed grants resulted in a number of use-ful insights and recommendations, which are summarized below.\n",
      "• Based on circular economy principles, urban and agri-cultural wastes can be repurposed as industrial resources. There are a variety of proven methods and technologies available, ranging from centralized waste collection and processing to decentralized applications that could func-tion at a neighborhood or individual household scale.\n",
      "• Circular economy advances will not only improve the resilience of urban and agricultural economies in the face of turbulent change, but also will deliver benefits including climate mitigation, food and water security, enhanced biodiversity, job creation, and empowerment of underprivileged communities.\n",
      "• Innovations in design and communication are necessary to induce behavior change, ranging from recycling of trash to the use of toilets rather than open defecation. Customized strategies are needed due to the vast differ -\n",
      "ences between rural villagers and urban populations.\n",
      "In order to advance toward a circular economy, changes \n",
      "in policy are needed to stimulate technological innova-tion and waste management improvements. The Swachh Bharat Mission represents a major step forward in raising consciousness and investing in cleaner practices. Indian industries and municipalities have shown that they can benefit from borrowing global best practices and proven approaches that provide benefits in terms of public health, sanitation, energy supply, water and land protection, and of course cost savings.\n",
      "There are a variety of instruments available to govern-\n",
      "ments in order to accelerate adoption of circular economy principles. These include regulatory requirements, market-based incentives such as subsidies, taxes, or cap and trade schemes, payments for enhancement of essential ecosystem services such as recarbonization of soil, and information campaigns to encourage voluntary initiatives.\n",
      "A number of policy-based initiatives were recommended \n",

      "ests and Climate Change 2016) The panel noted a need to improve the design and implementation of circular economy approaches, and offered a variety of policy recommenda-tions, including:\n",
      "• Product eco-labeling schemes to disclose recycled con-tent and other environmental benefits\n",
      "• Tax incentives to stimulate the use of greener and cleaner product and process technologies\n",
      "• Design standards that include resource efficiency and use of secondary raw materials\n",

      "energy amounts generated for the AD process. However, the biogasfacility in the case study operates with co-digestion: a feedstock mix\n",
      "consisting of sewage sludge, organic household waste and ﬁsh sludge.\n",
      "This mix delivers higher amounts of biogas than if only organic wastewas used as input ( Edwards et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the methane yield\n",
      "in use is higher than if only food waste would have been digested. Inaddition, it should be taken into account that the energy recovery from\n",

      "Third, when comparing generated emissions with avoided emis-\n",

      "This assumption in ﬂuences the di ﬀerence between the scenario results\n",

      "location of the AD facility, to fuel the trucks entirely on biogas or an-\n",

      "gaining weight as an alternative to the ‘make, use,  dispose’ paradigm (European Commission, \n",
      "2011). The recent ‘Global Waste Management Outlook’  (GWMO) has estimated about 7-10 \n",
      "billion tonnes of solid waste generation each year from urban households, commerce, industry \n",
      "and construction activities (UNEP and ISWA, 2015) w hich poses a severe threat to the \n",

      "economy exclusively focuses on economic need with t he core principles of ‘take, make, dispose’ \n",
      "over exploiting resources and technological innovat ions for economic growth. Linear economy \n",
      "models involve extracting resources and using them to make products and then disposing them in \n",

      "‘repair, refurbish, recycle’ by giving circular cri teria to the life cycle of the products. It emerged  \n",
      "as a paradigm shift with core principles ‘take, mak e, reuse’ that respond to environmental and \n",
      "societal needs while using natural resources. A cir cular economy values resources by keeping \n",
      "materials and products in use for as long as possib le. Such a shift to a circular economy model \n",
      "requires eco-innovations of resources to manifest t he needs of environmental resilience, despite \n",

      "From the perspective of solid waste management, the  cost effectiveness of separated waste \n",

      "pricing system in Egypt, the cost of external impac ts is borne by society/households and neither \n",

      "environmental benefits in terms of both waste reduc tion and increased recycling rates \n",
      "(Karagiannidis et al., 2008; Lakhan, 2015; European  Commission 2015). Thus, the main \n",
      "scientific  research question is to investigate an integrated sustainable framework for a PAYT \n",
      "pricing model designed from an accounting perspecti ve, and then to explore the possible \n",
      "implementation methods of a PAYT program (Elia et a l., 2015) in the Egyptian MW \n",
      "management service. As a case study, the research s pecifically bases on the FCA method where \n",
      "PAYT is modified and calculated for Egyptian munici pal councils (for details, see Figure 3 and \n",
      "Equations 1-3). PAYT has two streams relating to co sts and benefits of the scheme. For waste \n",
      "disposal, reuse and recycling purposes, on the one hand, the cost aspect follows the introduction \n",
      "of a mandatory charge through fixed costs (FCF) for  construction and operational facilities and a \n",
      "variable cost (VCF) including direct (DC) and indir ect (IC) costs for the reduction of waste \n",
      "generation and increases in recycling rates. On the  other hand, the benefit aspect flows from food \n",
      "saving value (FSV) consumed and reduced, recyclable  waste price (RWP), compost value \n",
      "(COMV), energy saving value (ESV) and savings from greenhouse gas emission (GHG). \n",
      "Considering both costs and benefits together, the t otal waste charge under a PAYT scheme (i.e. \n",
      "fee collection or pricing) can be determined for ho useholds and businesses that eventually \n",
      "integrates with sustainable development from a circ ular economy viewpoint. This is how the \n",
      "application of FCA (PAYT scheme) can support transi tion to the circular economy by combining \n",
      "both economic and environmental challenges and prov iding a stable operating environment. \n",
      "The contribution of the present study firstly deriv es from the fact that the MW sector has a \n",
      "strong public benefit component to reach the best M W management that result in the lowest cost \n",
      "Journal Pre-proof\n",

      "sites prior to collection processes by municipaliti es. The growing stream of MW in Egypt, either \n",
      "solid or food wastes, requires a sustainable waste management strategy  (Egypt's Vision 2030 \n",
      "Website, 2016), in addition to raising people’s and  organizational awareness towards this problem \n",
      "(Elmenofi et al., 2015). To adopt separated waste c ollection schemes and for raising public \n",
      "awareness, implementation of the PAYT accounting ap proach is essential. There are three \n",
      "technical pillars to implementing the PAYT approach : identifying the waste generator, measuring \n",
      "the waste amount that needs treatment, and unit pri cing per emptying household and/or per kg or \n",
      "tonne. Both councils and households would get direc t benefits of a cost-effective MW \n",

      "that leads to the lowest cost and maximum benefit f or all interested parties in MW management \n",
      "systems in Egypt by considering direct and indirect  benefits to achieve sustainability. A second \n",
      "benefit is to support the design and the applicatio n of the effective PAYT accounting approach for \n",
      "pricing MW collection systems in Egypt by integrati ng economic, environmental and social \n",
      "aspects which are still lacking in the literature a nd in real practice. The proposed PAYT model \n",
      "aims to fill this gap by designing an integrated fr amework to support policy makers and waste \n",
      "managers in the adoption of PAYT schemes. It can cr eate substantial economic, social & \n",
      "environmental benefits for industry, energy & food security, especially if it is managed properly \n",
      "with reasonable implementation of an integrated sus tainable weight-based or volume-based \n",
      "PAYT costing approach.  Such an accounting approach  is still lacking in the literature and real \n",
      "practice in Egypt. Therefore, it is expected that t he paper would contribute to the reevaluation of \n",
      "the current policy measures and the modification of  the pricing policy design for municipalities. \n",
      "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 briefly highlights the \n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "As one of the world ’s emerging market economies, Indonesia\n",
      "has confronted MSW problems over the past years. With an area of\n",
      "1.9 million km2, currently Indonesia is home to about 274 million of\n",
      "inhabitants in 2020, accounting for 3.5% of the world ’s population.\n",
      "Presently about 200,000 Mt of MSW is generated nationwide daily.\n",
      "On average, about 384 large cities in Indonesia generate about\n",
      "2.2e2.7 kg of MSW per capita daily ( Brotosusilo and Handayani,\n",
      "2020 ). In Indonesia, the MSW mostly consists of organic waste,\n",
      "paper, and glass ( Sudibyo et al., 2017 ). The refuse is classi ﬁed either\n",
      "as residential or non-residential waste. Sixty percent of residential\n",
      "waste (by weight) consists of degradable organic materials, while\n",
      "their amount in non-residential waste varies depending on mois-\n",
      "ture content.\n",
      "With an annual population growth of 1.4%, it is anticipated that\n",
      "by the end of 2020, the amount of MSW generation in Indonesia\n",
      "would reach 1.5 times more than that of the last decade ( Gunawan\n",
      "et al., 2020 ). The increment in the magnitude and complexity of the\n",

      "For most cities in Indonesia, waste management is undertaken\n",
      "as a public service with high expenses that include labour, equip-\n",

      "80% and 90% of the MSWM budget for collection costs alone\n",

      "properly with the limited resources they have ( Mak et al., 2019 ).\n",
      "In Yogyakarta, the provincial government spent US$105,000 for\n",
      "the MSW to be collected and transported to local land ﬁlls\n",
      "(Rusqiyati, 2015 ). In Jakarta, over 35% of the government budget has\n",
      "been allocated for MSWM, of which almost 90% is used to cover\n",
      "waste collection, while the rest of the expenditure is allocated for\n",
      "transportation and waste disposal ( Kurniawan et al., 2013 ). How-\n",
      "ever, there is still 40% of the waste uncollected and only 50% of the\n",

      "Food waste and loss can further be classiﬁed into three broad\n",
      "categories – avoidable, partly (optional) avoidable and unavoidable\n",
      "food waste ( Kranert et al., 2012 ). For industry, avoidable food\n",
      "waste includes damaged or contaminated products that have not\n",

      "occurs for a number of reasons, including over-purchasing, poor\n",
      "food preparation techniques, inadequate storage and excessive\n",
      "serving sizes ( Bagherzadeh et al., 2014 ). The avoidable component\n",

      "food waste usually arises during the preparation and consumption\n",
      "of foods. This mainly includes both non-edible constituents (e.g.\n",
      "bones, banana peels or the like) and edible parts (e.g. potato peels).\n",
      "In industrialised countries, majority of the food waste is gener-\n",

      "capita basis, consumers in Europe waste food between 95 and\n",
      "115 kg/year ( FAO, 2011 ). In the EU, over 50% of the total food waste\n",

      "food services (12%), production (11%), wholesale and retail (5%)\n",
      "(Stenmarck et al., 2016 ). Thus, in theory at least, the current largest\n",

      "et al. (2017) reported an increase of moisture content (from\n",
      "62.81% to 70.44% after 40 s) in In T. molitor L. larvae; however\n",
      "the water activity remained constant. They reported the cause to\n",
      "be the absorption and entrapment of water inside the larva just\n",
      "below the chitinous exoskeleton. According to Azzollini et al.\n",
      "(2016) , high temperature blanching may result structural changes\n",
      "in some proteins, resulting in alteration, denaturation and\n",
      "crosslinking of protein molecules. However, there are no reports\n",
      "of signiﬁcant adverse effects in chemical composition in blanched\n",

      "2. Literature review2.1. Accountability theory\n",
      "Accountability theory explains how the perceived need to justify\n",
      "one ’s behaviours to another party (that has the authority to\n",
      "administer rewards or punishments), causes one to consider and\n",
      "feel accountable for the process by which decisions and judgmentshave been reached ( Tetlock, 1992 ;Vance et al., 2015 ). As a result,\n",
      "the likelihood that one will think deeply and systematically about\n",
      "one ’s procedural behaviours increases signi ﬁcantly ( Vance et al.,\n",
      "2015 ).\n",
      "According to Vance et al. (2013 ,2015) , accountability theory\n",
      "proposes four major dimensions of accountability mechanisms:\n",
      "identi ﬁability, expectation of evaluation, awareness of monitoring,\n",
      "and social presence. Identi ﬁability is the individual ’s“knowledge\n",
      "that his outputs could be linked to him ”(Williams et al., 1981 ,p .\n",
      "309). Hence, individuals modify their behaviours if they believe\n",
      "their identity might be revealed in the process ( Reicher and Levine,\n",
      "1994 ).Expectation of evaluation is the belief that one ’s“perfor-\n",
      "mance will be assessed by another [party] according to some\n",
      "normative ground rules and with some implied consequences ”\n",
      "(Lerner and Tetlock, 1999 , p. 255). This expectation increases so-\n",
      "cially desirable behaviours in individuals ( Lerner and Tetlock, 1999 ;\n",
      "Hochwarter et al., 2007 ).Monitoring is the process of watching or\n",
      "tracking an individual user ’s activities ( Grifﬁth, 1993 ). An aware-\n",
      "ness of monitoring fosters the expectation of evaluation (\n",
      "Vance\n",
      "et al., 2015 ).Social presence is the awareness of other users in the\n",
      "system ( Walther, 1992 ). It is widely accepted that individuals\n",
      "exhibit increased conformist behaviour in the presence of another\n",
      "person even when that person is not directly present and cannot be\n",
      "observed ( Bond and Titus, 1983 ).\n",
      "According to Ferris et al. (1995) , the source of accountability\n",
      "may be internal or external to the actor. When individuals perceive\n",
      "internal accountability, the obligation to perform certain behav-\n",
      "iours is caused by the actor ’s own commitment to the behaviour.\n",
      "Hence, no formal control mechanism is required and, rather, in-\n",
      "dividuals act out of a sense of personal control ( Dose and Klimoski,\n",
      "1995 ). Conversely, under external accountability, actors feel\n",
      "responsible and obligated to perform certain behaviours because\n",
      "they are expected to do so by others. Thus, an external controlsystem would be required to satisfy the accountability demands\n",
      "(Erdogan et al., 2004 ;Merchant and Otley, 2006 ;Boos et al., 2013 ).\n",
      "Insights from control theories suggest that human actors can\n",
      "only be held accountable if they can understand, predict and in-\n",
      "ﬂuence work processes ( Grote, 2009 ). In the case of perceived in-\n",
      "ternal accountability, theories suggest that actors should only be\n",
      "held accountable for outcomes if they had the freedom to choose\n",
      "between two or more alternatives and to act in a chosen manner\n",
      "(Boos et al., 2013 ). In this way, individuals feel that they have\n",
      "enough control over the situation to achieve the end results ( Dose\n",
      "and Klimoski, 1995 ). In cases of perceived external accountability,B. Wang, M. Farooque, R.Y. Zhong et al. Journal of Cleaner Production 300 (2021) 126773\n",
      "2\n",
      "however, the expectations must be appropriately structured and\n",
      "explicitly communicated prior to the performance period for actors\n",
      "to assume responsibility ( Dose and Klimoski, 1995 ;Merchant and\n",
      "Otley, 2006 ). During the performance period, the evaluators\n",
      "monitor reports of what the individuals were being held account-\n",
      "able for. Mitchell (1993) argues that, for accountability to have an\n",
      "inﬂuence on behaviour, there is a need to associate a reward or\n",
      "punishment system based on the individual ’s performance. This\n",
      "would make the evaluation process more meaningful to the actors.\n",
      "Thus, behaviour results from control mechanisms, including\n",
      "perceived accountability ( Beu and Buckley, 2001 ).\n",
      "2.2. Accountability and IoT technologies\n",
      "When accountability is used for monitoring and evaluation\n",
      "purposes, IoT technologies are considered to be key enablers of the\n",
      "control capabilities of the actor demanding the accountability\n",
      "(Winthereik et al., 2007 ;Bose et al., 2009 ;Boos et al., 2013 ). The IoT\n",
      "refers to an integrated network of physical objects that are equip-\n",
      "ped with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity\n",
      "functionalities so that they are able to connect and exchange data(Atzori et al., 2010 ). IoT technologies can generate large amounts of\n",
      "granular and accurate real-time data automatically ( Brous et al.,\n",
      "2020 ), which is very important in the accountability process. For\n",
      "example, automatic identi ﬁcation and data capture (AIDC) tech-\n",
      "nology, one of the key elements in IoT, is able to automatically\n",
      "identify objects without human involvement, in order to collect\n",
      "data ( Stojkoska and Trivodaliev, 2017 ). IoT technologies make\n",
      "certain aspects of the work process –which previously may have\n",
      "been considered to be inaccessible and opaque –visible and\n",
      "available for analysis. For example, big data powered by IoT tech-\n",
      "nologies (e.g., sensors and devices) coupled with supply chain an-\n",
      "alytics can be used to discover new insights for better and faster\n",
      "decision-making based on data that was previously inaccessible\n",
      "or unusable ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). In principle, this characteristic of\n",
      "IoT technologies is well-aligned with the accountability mechanism\n",
      "which attempts to make the invisible visible ( Munro, 1996 ). How-\n",
      "ever, it is important to evaluate the IoT application used for\n",
      "accountability in the ﬁrst instance, as the extent of control depends\n",
      "on the capacities of the technology in use ( Boos et al., 2013 ).\n",
      "2.3. Accountability and household waste source separation\n",
      "Source separation of household waste is considered an effective\n",
      "method for enhancing recycling and minimising waste ( Chung and\n",
      "Poon, 2001 ). According to Gu et al. (2015) , the recyclable compo-\n",
      "nent of household solid waste may reach up to 89.3%. Hence,\n",
      "increased levels of household-level source separation can facilitate\n",

      "sustainable development, many developed countries use system-\n",
      "atic and integrated waste source separation programs ( Xu et al.,\n",
      "2017 ). However, low recycling rates of household solid waste\n",
      "have been observed and reported in the extant literature ( Fan et al.,\n",
      "2019 ). For example, the cross-country report of MSW in 32 Euro-\n",

      "recycling rate of less than 10%, eleven countries recycle between10% and 20%, seven countries between 20% and 30%, and only six\n",
      "countries achieve material recycling levels that are higher than 30%\n",
      "(European Environment Agency, 2013 ). Similarly, the recycling rate\n",
      "in the United States is equivalent to 35.2% ( United States\n",
      "Environmental Protection Agency, 2017 ).\n",
      "Until now, most efforts (both academic and practical) to improve\n",
      "source-separated collection rate can be classi ﬁed into two main\n",

      "Pedersen and Manhice, 2020 ). The second stream has been focused\n",
      "on understanding the behavioural factors affecting household\n",

      "accountability to put the waste into the right bins. Waste that is\n",
      "incorrectly sorted may be the result of certain behaviour-related\n",
      "attributes, such as carelessness, ignorance, lack of education, etc.\n",
      "Moreover, a lack of effective onsite supervision and administrative\n",
      "systems to incentivise the desired behaviours also undermine at-\n",
      "tempts to hold residents accountable, which leads to the poor levels\n",
      "of performance reported. A case study of Suzhou, China indicatedthat 43% of the respondents thought they knew how to source-\n",

      "waste accurately ( Zhang and Wen, 2014b ).A system enabled by IoT technologies, however, can avoid such\n",
      "ﬂaws. With IoT-enabled HWSS, the resident needs to scan their\n",
      "family ID-related barcode, or QR code, to open the correct bin in\n",
      "order to dispose of the waste. In this way, the IoT system can easily\n",
      "link the residents ’identities with their waste disposal behaviours,\n",
      "thus improving their identi ﬁability ( Williams et al., 1981 ) which,\n",
      "according to accountability theory ( Reicher and Levine, 1994 ),\n",
      "shapes their behaviour. The IoT system can immediately detect if\n",
      "the waste has been disposed of accurately. Also, it simultaneously\n",

      "using devices such as smartphones and computers. Meanwhile, the\n",
      "internal motivation of residents to sort waste can be reinforced by a\n",
