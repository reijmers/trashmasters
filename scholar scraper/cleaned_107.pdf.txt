wileyonlinelibrarycom DOI ep Unsound postconsumer disposal is the primary pathway of plastic into the ecosystem One way of addressing this problemis through the establishment of a circular economy for plastic Much of the unsound disposal comes from economically dis advantaged regions where waste disposal and recycling infra structure is limited In economically disadvantaged regions however the establishment of a circular economy for plasticmust be locally managed and decentralized meaning that the disposal collection remanufacture and use must all occur within the same community We suggest that waste plastic abatement strategies must be targeted to reduce reuse and recycle plastic waste onsite at the local level initiating a circu lar economy appropriate for infrastructure limited regions Technologies for recycling plastic must be low cost economi cally viable socially acceptable and not adversely impact theenvironment and also produce a product that has a ready local market This is critical because unless proposed solutions are also economically viable and socially appropriate they are unlikely to be successful especially in underdeveloped regions Using big data analysis a metric for identifyingcountries that will have the most potential to bene t from a locally managed decentralized circular economy for plastic has been developed The information obtained from this met ric will help researchers and policy makers promote a locally managed decentralized circular economy of plastic for managing the accumulation of waste on land and its eventual migration into waterways Additionally we present a case study of a proposed locally managed decentralized waste plas tic abatement strategy in the municipal solid waste infrastruc ture limited country of Uganda American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog Keywords alternate fuels sustainability INTRODUCTION Plastics are used in every country on earth and none is able to successfully collect and manage of its plastic waste Once produced plastic enters the global supply chain and is used in all regions of the world In fact our world is generating consuming and discarding more plastic than ever and therates are increasing The growth rate of plastic productionhas increased at per year worldwide In approxi mately million metric tons MT of plastic were producedwith million discarded as waste by coastal populations living within km of the coast Additionally it was estimatedthat of the plastic waste generated that year million MTwere mismanaged on land and million MT entered the oceans If current trends continue by billionMT of plastic are likely to be produced with approximately billion MT disposed of as waste billion MT mismanaged on land and billion MT eventually entering the oceans This is a fold increase in a matter of yrsmeaning that global plastic production is increasing exponentially Just between and we will make as much plastic as has been made since its production began There are numerous potential resting spots for waste plastic in the ecosystem including disposal in land lls recycling incineration and unregulated dumping Disposal on land isthe most common option with previous studies showing thatglobally of plastic municipal solid waste MSW is discarded in open space or in land lls A key challenge is that in much of the world appropriate waste disposal options areunavailable including properly managed land lls leading to waste plastic simply being dumped on open unestablishedplots accumulating on sides of roadways and on outskirts ofrural residential areas This accumulation of plastic waste on land can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes cause clogged waterways and drainages and reduce the general aesthetics of the community As plastic can take thousands ofyears to decompose both land lls and unregulated plots of land will remain unusable long after the dumping ends and if not managed properly chemicals can leach from theplastic into surrounding habitats Eventually this plasticwaste will be disposed of in or migrate to surface waters generating pollution and threating both terrestrial and marine lifeSpeci cally in major bodies of water plastic waste is ingested by marine life and bird species resulting in adverse healtheffects entanglement and death Figure shows plastic bags collecting in a drainage canal in Kampala Uganda due to unregulated dumping This is a common problem in many resourceconstrained or infrastructurelimited parts of the world where lack of effective governmental policy MSW management administration and planningalong with insuf cient household education economic pres sures limited perspectives on hazards associated with wasteaccumulation and scarce stakeholder involvement affect how Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online ver sion of this article American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environmental Progress Sustainable Energy DOI ep Month waste is disposed or managed Other factors include growing economies urbanization and increased standards ofliving which led to rapid increases in waste generation indeveloping countries In rural regions particularly access to centralized collection and recycling methods are often una vailable Consequently uncontrolled growth coupled with lackof suf cient infrastructure and regulation in underdeveloped regions of developing countries compounds the waste management problem Because these factors include eco nomic and social as well as environmental components it is critical that proposed solutions include them as well Therefore in our view without considering the three pillars of sustainability MSW management solutions are unlikely to achievelongterm success A Perspective on a Locally Managed Decentralized Circular Economy Unfortunately there are currently no globally effective strat egies to keep waste plastic out of the ecosystem that meet the challenges of both developed and developing countries This is primarily because waste plastic is not a pointsource pollutant As plastic enters the ecosystems from numerous points it has been a major obstacle for control Moreover low income and lowtomiddle income countries lack the resourcesto address this problem In fact in addition to lack of waste collection and management infrastructure in underdeveloped regions researchers have identi ed that simply the lack of convenient waste disposal containers can affect household waste disposal decisions If people have to walk longdistances to reach a suitable disposal location they will simply dump the waste nearby on streets underdeveloped plots of land or burn it leading to potentially toxic smoke especially if plastics are present This underscores our assertion that locally managed decentralized solutions targeting waste where it is generated rather than focusing on centralized processing may be more effective in communities where governmental waste solution efforts are minimal This type of approach empowers individuals and small communities to adapt and invent solutions rather than waiting on centralauthorities to enact policies and regulations to address the problem As a result a locally managed decentralized circular economy of plastic products is generated encouraging directusers of plastic to consider and bene t from opportunities of providing waste plastic a value or by generating new life cycles for plastic products through a cradletocradle approach We assert that a decentralized circular economy of plastic at the local level can have tremendous bene ts in reducing the accumulation of plastic waste on land and its eventual migration to major bodies of water An industrial circular economy replaces the produceconsumediscard model by reusing recy cling or reentering products into their manufacturing supply chain on an industrial scale However at the local level especially in rural regions remanufacturing of plasticproducts or creating the infrastructure networks to reenter them into their respective supply chains is dif cult Traditional solutions like centralized recycling of plastic waste are also often impractical in remote regions or regions lacking well developed infrastructure due to the transportation costs making largescale recycling operations uneconomical Hence a locally managed decentralized circular economy functions to manage waste on small scale in rural regions without the need of industrial technologies or developed infrastructure Viable solutions are those that are low cost can be implemented utilizing the region s technical knowledge and most importantly provide an incentive for local people to collect reuse and recycle themselves In many economically disadvantaged regions an informal local recycling sector exists via a system of waste pickers that sort through dumpsites to collect saleable materials such as metals plastics glass and papers Often waste pickers travel throughout communities of rural regions and cities to collect recyclables from housetohouse as well or set up recycling dropoff locations paying individuals a small incentive for valuable materials Afterward the waste pickers will sort through collected materials clean and sell them to recycling companies for a pro t These companies then shred and process the materials as desired by manufacturing organi zations In this way rural communities and heavily populated urban centers of developing countries bene t from a decentra lized circular economy of recyclable materials including plastics However not all plastics that are recyclable are of value to waste pickers due to a nonexistent recycling market For instance polyethylene shopping bags are generated in large Figure Waste plastic and other trash clog a spillway in Kampala Uganda Color gure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrarycom Month Environmental Progress Sustainable Energy DOI epvolumes globally but they are recycled in extremely low quantities accumulating on sides of streets dumps and landlls in developing countries Even in the United States billion plastic bags are consumed annually with only being recycled So unless waste plastic items such as polyethylene bags can be given a value they will continue to be unsustainably used and discarded Therefore we assert that a locally managed decentralized circular economy with infor mal recycling playing a vital role in decreasing the accumulation of plastic waste is needed Furthermore we believe that including social and economic considerations in addition to environmental are critical to successful waste plastic abatementstrategies in underdeveloped regions which has been lacking in most plastic abatement strategies In Figure we propose a strategy for establishing a circular economy at the local level by applying the three principles of sustainability to decentralized waste plastic management Thisstrategy is thermal decomposition of waste plastic to fuel oil at temperatures of CCCC Highdensity polyethylene lowdensity polyethylene polystyrene and polypropylene plas tics can be easily converted to fuel similar in compo sition to diesel and kerosene by individual entrepreneursutilizing appropriate technology AT providing a potential path to a locally managed decentralized circular economy AT is sim ple nonautomated technology requiring little to no electricity designed for a speci cr e g i o nt om e e ts p e c i c challenges according to available resources An AT solution for thermaldecomposition of waste plastic is the UKATS Processor This invention is constructed locally utilizing existent construc tion materials available infrast ructure technical knowledge of intended users and from easily acquired locally generated plas tic wastes For instance the UKATS Processor is wood red to allow for the skills of rural communities that operate wood red cookstoves to be readily applied Moreover the desired plastics can be easily collected by waste pickers or entrepreneurs byeither identifying the plastic recycling numbers and respectively or by performing a simple density test of theshredded plastics in water That is if the waste plastics oat on water they are suitable for reprocessing to fuel oil Consequently a locally managed decentralized circular econ omy gives waste plastic an econom ic value which incentivizes people to collect and use it locally reducing waste accumulation It further signi cantly reduces the need for physical and technical infrastructure to implement an industrial circular economy of plastic by involving local community participation as shown in Figure In addition this approach is socially and environmentally appropriate For instance as accumulation of waste decreases sanitation issues decrease improving community health Likewise environmental bene ts are reaped by decreas ing waste leachate into soil and reducing toxic hazards associated with incineration of plastic waste a commonly practiced alterna tive to managing accumulation in rural regions and near slums The fuel oil itself also d oes not have sulfur dioxide emis sions as sulfur is not present in the carbonhydrogen plastic polymer chains reducing greenhouse gas sulfur dioxide emissions in comparison with traditional petroleum derived fuels Identifying Regions of Greatest Potential for a Locally Managed Decentralized Circular Economy We propose that in order to identify countries that will have the greatest potential for a locally managed decentralized circular economy the three pillars of sustainability environmen tal economic and social acceptability should be incorporated Hence waste plastic abatement strategies cannot simply focus on the environment they must also be economi cally viable and socially acceptable We believe that unlesssolutions are targeted to be appropriate for the communities for which they are intended they will ultimately be unsuccess ful To validate this perspective we developed a simple metric that utilizes a big data approach to analyze countries outlook in each of the three pillars of sustainability highlightingregions where a locally managed decentralized circular econ omy for plastic is likely to have the highest positive impact Figure A locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic in infrastructure limited regions Color gure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrarycom Environmental Progress Sustainable Energy DOI ep Month Today data availability is better than it has ever been Gov ernments private corporations and NGOs are collecting ever increasing volumes of data and much of that data is now pub licly available and readily accessible via the Internet This datais useful in conducting sustainability assessments for individual countries and regions Here it is organized and analyzed to identify countries which can potentially bene t from a plastic circular economy at the local level with decentralized waste plastic abatement strategies The purpose of this metric istherefore to identify countries that have speci c challenges with any or all three of the pillars of sustainability in meeting their waste management challenges in return directly affectingthe way plastic waste is handled Often waste management is a priority in urbanized regions of developing countries with little attention given to rural regions Challenges such as variation in income level conditions of road infrastructure and perception of communities toward wasteincluding education regarding hazards associated with waste inuence the way waste is handled in both urban and rural regions As a result wealthy communities experience regular waste collection while slums outside of a city are perceived as dumping grounds for waste Thus our approach considers thechallenges facing each country or region in terms of economic social and environmental concerns to propose decentralized waste plastic solutions that are tailored to the region s availability of infrastructure capital and technical knowledge Moreover if community participation is prioritized engineered AT solutionsare more likely to be accepted leading to intended uses and benets reducing the dependency on central waste collection and management for rural regions speci cally In this metric a list of countries was analyzed using nine indicators representing the three pillars of sustainability eco nomic social and environmental These indicators are described in Table and were chosen because they identify countries with widespread poverty underdevelo ped infrastructure weak gov ernmental institutions and an existing MSW management problem key indicators for determining the suitability of a locally managed decentralized circula r economy The development of the metric see Eq considers assigning speci c and globalweighting factors to each of th e nine indicators mentioned in Table to highlight the importance of each indicator and the envi ronmental economic or social outlook of the countries As a result a country ss p e c i c and global weighting factors can be individually adjusted to ensure that the country s outlook chal lenges and advantages are equally highlighted Afterward the sum of indicators and respective weighting factors results in a comparison score of each country s viability for a locally managed decentralized circular economy Further details of this approachare described in the Supplementary Information X n iGECIECSEC IECSEC C GSCISCSSC ISCSSC ISCSSC C GEVIEVSEV IEVSEV

the economic and social indicators which are often over looked Users can adjust local or global indicator weighting factors according to a region s unique challenges or to empha size a speci c category that contributes to plastic waste mis management Hence opportunities for managing waste can be identi ed with a locally managed decentralized circular econ omy being a viable approach

Environmental Progress Sustainable Energy DOI epsuitable for a locally managed decentralized circular economy are illustrated in Figure Darker colors represent countries that are most likely to bene t from this approach It can be observed that subSaharan Africa East Asia Southeast Asia and South Asia are the most promising regions for applying decentra lized solutions to plastic waste management This informationindicates that typically developing highly populated lowmiddle to middle income countries are the most important targets for locally managed decentralized waste plastic abatement strate gies The reason being that even though the citizens of these countries generate less waste per capita the consequence of higher population density results in an overall larger amount of MSW generation than developed regions Coupled with limited nancial resources lack of infrastructure and reliable access toenergy waste is increasingly susceptible to unsound dis posal in open dumps streets and waterways especially in rural communities Contrastingly developing nations considered by the metric that may consume greater amounts of energy and generate higher amounts of MSW per capita are not ideal loca tions for a locally managed decentralized circular economy dueto the reasons of improved collection strong waste management infrastructure controlled waste disposal and an existent central ized industrial circular economy leading to reduction in unsound waste disposal The usefulness of this metric can be additionally demon strated by weighting one of the three sustainability categories greater than the rest as per the user s interests To illustrate this the weighting of global sustainability indicators was varied by Figure Suitable regions for a locally managed

Sustainable Energy DOI ep Month assigning a value of to one while the other two were set to This analysis is presented in Table and signi es that when weighting the global economic indicator higher countries with relatively low GDP per capita and high percentages of pop ulation living below the poverty line rise to the top as most suit able regions In like manner for social sustainability countries with the greatest population numbers or population density are recommended Meanwhile estimated plastic waste in MSW and estimated unsound disposal of plastic waste in MTday werefound to be the biggest contributing factors for environmental sustainability highlighting regions suffering from uncontrolled waste accumulation Lastly the metric also depicts the impact ofenvironmental stress or the amount of waste generated per km of land Countries that rank highly in this category include theUnited States many western European nations as well as high income Southeast Asian countries such as Hong Kong Macao and Singapore which have signi cant environmental stress due to either high generation of MSW population density andor limited land area As an example India had the position of being th overall in this metric analysis while being nd th and th most suitable country when global economic social and environmental indicators were respectively highlighted for implemen tation of a locally managed decentralized circular economy Therefore it can be concluded that for India the lack of waste management education attitude toward environmental protec tion and insuf cient collection infrastructure combined with increased waste generation due to population density are the most probable causes of plastic waste accumulation instead of capital constraints It is also important to note that even thougha circular economy is well established in China the country currently practices a centralized industrial circular economy Hence it could likewise bene t from a locally man aged decentralized circular economy approach in rural regions due to high waste generation associated large populations Although this analysis may appear to simply reinforce well established beliefs these results are used to make the point that developing urban and rural regions around the world are different in return requiring different strategies for MSW and waste plastic abatement The information obtained from theanalysis suggests that African nations vary in their economic social and environmental stance compared with developing regions of Asia This fact in itself alters the way waste manage ment is approached in these countries as cultural norms asso ciated with perception of waste management vary Anotherexample is the data highlighting importance of waste recycling in the Americas versus in Europe Even though both regions are developed environmentally benign waste management ispracticed in many European nations via a variety of wasteto energy solutions while a large portion of waste in the United States goes to the land ll Hence the data are used to make the case for designing and developing technologies based on each region s outlook suggesting a locally managed decentra lized circular economy in rural regions of developing countries Uganda Case Study The country of Uganda is positioned nd in the metric assessment meaning that it has great potential for a locally managed decentralized circular economy with informal recy cling waste management approaches Uganda has a population of million with a growth rate of in The size of the country is slightly smaller in area than the US state of Oregon The nation has abundant natural resources fertile soil suf cient rainfall and small deposits of precious minerals and oil Consequently agriculture andservice sectors employ a combined of the population with coffee revenues accounting for the majority of the exports Nonetheless the US Central Intelligence Agency reportsthat Uganda is facing economic challenges due to sharp increase in refugees from South Sudan high energy costs inadequate transportation and energy infrastructure insuf cient budgetary discipline and corruption Furthermoreduring and the Uganda shilling depreciated against the US dollar Moreover the nation s GDP per capita is equivalent to USD with unemployment rate and of the population below poverty line This along with only of the total population having access toelectricity and population having access to sanitation facilities has further led to very high risks of major infectious diseases Despite these challenges the nation is poised asa good t for implementation of decentralized waste manage ment solutions offering opportunities to recycle plastic waste locally creating jobs and reducing the spread of diseases due to accumulation of trash A case study conducted in Uganda at the Kiteezi land ll in the capital city of Kampala reveals some insight on how the proposed metric has been employed for this region In the population of Kampala was reported to be approximately million with of the citizens living in informal settle ments scattered around the city However as the countrys capital it is the home of major markets and a wide assortment of job opportunities which leads to a doubling of the city s population during the day increasing waste gen eration Therefore smallscale decentralized AT solutions to waste management are suggested for this city with both thecommunity s and waste pickers participation Currently the Kampala Capital City Authority KCCA a governmental solid waste management organization providescollection and cleanup services to the city sve divisions a total kmarea contracting collection of waste from afuent areas to private companies Hence the af uent areas are charged a waste collection fee while the rest of the urban population is serviced by KCCA at no cost KCCAfurther manages the city s acre m tall land ll site at Kiteezi where both KCCA and private sector waste collection vehicles unload MSW excluding industrial waste free of charge At present a total of MT of MSW per day are land lled about half of the total waste generated by the city This means that the other half is openly dumped in areas inaccessible to waste collection vehicles including drainage channels wetlands natural water courses manholes undeveloped plots or on the roadside This is a strong indication that consumer involvement and decentralized solutions to waste accumulation are needed The compo sition of the waste mainly consists of biodegradable food and garden waste stones and debris plastics paper glass and metals textiles and others KCCA spends approximately USDMT for waste collection and disposal services Waste to energy solutions and organized recycling services are not yet offered by KCCA Nonetheless small independently operated recycling dropoffs exist in the city s districts As these recycling dropoffs are new to the city each district only has one thus far handling merely tons of waste per week Consequently most of the waste is sent to the Kiteezi landll where it is informally sorted for recycling by waste pickers With in number the organized community of waste pickers who live surrounding the land ll collect any thing that has a welldeveloped market such as construction tarps plastic bottles paper glass and metals More specif ically the plastic waste that is recycled by the waste pickers ispurchased by domestic and international organizations that pay the pickers UGXkg A waste picker typically collects around kgday of plastic earning UGXday which is higher than the average city dweller who earns around UGXday However the waste pickers do not collectsoft plastics composition of total MSW such as polyethylene shopping bags known locally as kaveera sas Month Environmental Progress Sustainable Energy DOI epthey do not have a ready recycling market Furthermore despite the ban on production of plastic bags in the country similar to other African nations lenient governmen tal enforcement allows for illegal selling of the polyethylenebags Consequently the kaveeras are likely to continue to accumulate in the Kiteezi land ll in the coming years unless action is taken Therefore we recommend that closecoupled decentralized circular economy of plastic be encouraged via strategies suchas conversion of polyethylene shopping bags and other soft plastics to fuel oil and similar products through AT This is a viable solution that can further create employmentopportunities Using the statistics previously mentioned roughly kg of soft plastics are brought to the Kiteezi landll per day If kgday of soft plastic waste can be picked by an individual a resulting additional jobs could be created at the Kiteezi site Because the amount of soft plastics brought to the land ll are only half of that generated within the city a similar opportunity exists for local citizens entrepreneurs and communities to recycle the waste plastic to fuel creating additional jobs The amount of fuel generated could be used as a substitute for kerosene and diesel applications especially for cooking lighting generators and farming machinery This establishment of a locally managed decentralized circular economy could potentially have a mon umental impact on the accumulation of nondegradable soft plastic accumulation at the Kiteezi land ll and in the Kampala city improving the aesthetics of the region and providing entrepreneurial and job opportunities which will eventually bene t the entire nation Thus by employing the perspec tive metric established in this research the results of this case study serve as an example for other nations The metric s use of sustainabilityfocused indicators can assist in identifying a region s potential suitability for a locally managed decentra lized circular economy for waste plastic management CONCLUSIONS In conclusion even though all developing countries encounter similar challenges to economic development waste plastic management practices are likely to vary from region to region requiring a detailed analysis approach based on the principles of sustainability to determine which nations would most bene t from a locally managed decentralized circular economy for plastic waste Often due to lack of capital resources centralized waste collection infrastructure and the population s awareness of the consequences of global waste accumulation rural and developing communities suffer from major sanitation issues and pose serious environmental concerns Thus it is our view that decentralized or distributed approaches with high levels of local participation be proposed for waste plastic abatement strategies to be successful Themetric established in this research has been utilized to glean insight for validating this assertion on the importance of including infrastructural economical societal and environ mental constraints in deciding how waste abatement strategies and resources should be prioritized Thus focusing on simplelowcost technologies like thermal decomposition which can be employed at a local level via AT methods enable the devel opment of a locally managed decentralized circular econo mies This approach promotes communitymanaged collection and recycle of plastic waste directly where it is generated in asustainable manner SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Details discussing
