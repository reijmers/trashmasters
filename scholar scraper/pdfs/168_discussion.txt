and Conclusions 
Circular economy and industrial symbiosis should not be seen only the way to solve the waste 
management problem, but it can also be seen as the part of social and economic development. The 
change towards circular economy takes time and it needs actions from different sectors (universities, 
government and private sector). 
Digital ecosystems and industrial symbiosis should be seen as continuous developing entirety, which 
will change and renew themselves thus maintaining their competiveness.  
Digitalization, circular economy and industrial symbiosis are the key drivers, which will change the 
business environments, a way to act and create innovation. Innovations will need “real life” 
(transdisciplinary) piloting environments. Both, resource efficiency and digitalization are directing 
towards service business and environments. 
The expenses of circular economy development should not be calculated in short turn business profit 
basis but circular economy development should be seen as long term strategic investment which will 
bring long term benefits to different sectors of society.
