Reporting good CE implementation practices may help academics
and companies to gain knowledge on circular economic sustainable
business models (Kirchherr et al., 2018) as well as on sustainable
consumption and production patterns. Moreover, scholars should con-
tribute by showing relevant results obtained by applying CE principles
(Reike et al., 2018), thus helping companies to reduce their food losses
and waste.The results of our analysis focused on the description of lifecycle for
pasta production, showed that the FLW occurring along this production
chain can be effectively reused for other purposes thus provided us with
valuable insights on the application of the CE perspective in order to
reduce FLW. In particular, we found that the straw produced during the
cultivation phase, that does not enter in the milling phase due to
physiological reasons, could be reused with these destinations: left in
the field as a natural fertilizer; animal feeding; energy recovery. In the
milling phase wheat co-products can be reused for animal feeding;
energy recovery, and landfill disposal. During the next phase, that is the
pasta production, the 2.3% of what is wasted – as described in Fig. 2 –
could be given to people in need (through food banks), to animals, orcomposted. At retail level the 0.2% of unsold product could be given to
food banks and as animal feeding. According to the literature, the main
issue remains at consumption level where basically the 25% of food
wasted could be reused with difficulty and ends up in landfill or at best
being composted.
By observing the results of empirical studies, policymakers and
businesses should focus their efforts on realizing more desirable, shorter
loop retention options, like remanufacturing, refurbishing and re-
purposing taking into account feasibility and overall system effects
(Reike et al., 2018).
As regards our specific case-study, FL in the field proved to be very
limited (less than 2%) while the straw collected during the harvest is
normally used as animal feed and litter. The losses generated during thegrinding of the wheat and pasta production amounted approximately to
2% of the total FLW.
