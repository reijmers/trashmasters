circular economy of food waste and its main idea waste as resource It explores the making of circularity by paying detailed attention to what is conceptualized as makeup work ie how interruptions and leaks along waste flows are handled in practice Makeup work capitalizes on its double meaning First it highlights the covering of cracks needed in order to transform waste to energy Second makeup work pinpoints that the neatness of circularity is far from a straightforward technical system but is continuously made Through an interviewbased study in Sweden the article illuminates three steps of transformation of food waste into the commodity of biogas analysing the material and cultural transformations showing that the micromanagement of preventing such interruptions is crucial Problems such as lack of or misfit material difficulties in sorting the substrate effectively overunderproduction of gas and the political decisions steering the conditions for supply and demand are equally crucial and pose the threat that the production will be viewed as inefficient Based on these results the article emphasizes the need to problematize the paradigm of the circular economy and the zerowaste

Background In city buses in Malm Sweden were covered with advertisements stating Banana peels in the tank We make biogas from your food waste see Figure The campaign visualized how discarded food could be transformed and as such refined and revalued through the socalled circular economy CE This counteracts traditional models of waste as a linear process of extractproduceusedump Instead the main logic behind the CE is that of discarded materials as potential resources that can be assigned a value through different steps along the chain of production and consumption Gregson et al The wasteasresource model mainly targets market and consumer behaviour as well as policy improvement To problematize this picture we argue that the CE is made through mundane careful and competent alignment of policy and the practice done by workers on the assembly As we will show continuous work is needed to keep the circle from leaks and disruptions We introduce makeup work as a probing concept with which to analyse the practice that contributes to reproducing the neatness of such circularity see below It is no coincidence that the banana peel campaign would emerge in Sweden The country has a high profile in the area of environmental issues Ideland and sustainable management of food waste has been on the political agenda at least since the s making it a fitting case for studying food waste management This study stretches beyond the commonplace understanding of the straightforwardness of waste management in a modern and sustainable country such as Sweden One of the contributions is to show that paying attention to human waste labour is essential not only when studying the Global South eg Doherty Ureta but crucial also in the seemingly advanced technobased North In the circular economy of food one of the aims with waste management is to produce resources bio fertilizers and biofuel The most valuable product is biogas a nonfossil fuel used for commercial and private vehicles and for heating Biogas infrastructures involve the flows of food waste management explicated below but also pipes transport trucks and gas stations for supplying the fuel Often the biogas is mixed with fossil natural gas because of uneven production of the former Swedish production of refined biogas is the third highest in Europe SOU Statens offentliga utredningar Swedish Government Official Reports and the Swedish Parliament intends to launch initiatives eg production support to further increase the use of Swedish biogas With production plants around the country of which most are small and run on wastewater and some are large and depend mainly on food waste there is indeed fertile soil for infrastructural readiness and the political will to realize a shift towards the wasteasresource paradigm About one third of all food most of it perfectly edible is thrown away and the national goals state that Efforts must be made so that by at least per cent of the food waste from households catering kitchens shops and restaurants is sorted out and treated biologically so that plant nutrition is utilized and at least per cent of food waste is treated so that energy is also used Digestion provides energy in the form of biogas and can replace other nonrenewable energy Naturvrdsverket Holmberg and Ideland The responsibility for working towards the objectives is distributed across different authorities among which the municipalities have a prominent position as they are obliged to organize the handling of waste at the local level Municipalities in turn translate environmental goals into concrete work the aim being to increase waste recycling and develop fossilfree fuel options for example through infrastructural investments or information campaigns like the one above The organization of food waste management in Sweden differs greatly across municipali ties Corvellec Hultman and Corvellec One common way to manage the collection and transportation of household waste is through public procurements of the service ie outsourcing management to private entrepreneurs whose contracts need to be renewed regularly Another solution is for food waste to be managed by publicowned cooperatives including one or several municipalities that are not procured or profit driven The commodification of waste by transforming it into commercial products here biogas and biofertilizer is arranged by either municipal or private companies or as is most often the case by hybrids of the two Lindqvist In other words this is an industry supported by political initiatives involving public and commercial actors where the latter often makes the profit Unpacking of the neat straightforwardness of the wasteasresource paradigm we argue that the CE is made through mundane careful and competent alignment of policy and the practice done by workers on the assembly The aim of the article is to explore the making of a CE of food waste in practice and based on this analysis to make a theoretical contribution to the field of waste studies by proposing makeup work as a useful concept Through an interviewbased study of transformations of food matter from banana peels to biogas we ask the following research questions what are the potential interruptions leaks and inflows in the CE of food waste and how are these inter ruptions prevented and handled by waste workers In the following the theoretical underpinnings of makeup work food waste materi ality and CE as a particular waste regime Gille are presented The next section Figure We make biogas from your food waste VASydse Journal of Material Culture highlights the methodology of trashtracing as well as interview and observation data After this review material and cultural transformations of the food waste are analysed in three parts refining leftovers a feeling for the slurry and making biogas In the con cluding discussion we further argue for the relevance of our makeup work approach how the potential inflows and leaks challenge the neatness of the CE of food waste and thus that the micromanagement of preventing interruptions is crucial Food waste in the circular economy Waste as a social and material object becomes devalued and revalued through cultural and institutional processes Douglas Reno Such processes concern for example how waste is sorted and classified as a resource vs still rubbish eg Lucas Roshizawa and Hird Food waste has always been a matter of societal concern due to its symbolic relation to dirt and disgust However it has also served as fertilizer and compost soil and more recently as a substantial basis for the production of biogas Organic household waste does indeed have a history that illustrates its ontological contingency not least because it is materially plastic This tension between cultural devaluing construction of waste and economic revaluing waste as resource makes it methodologically advantageous to study as waste flows in which social relations materials values agencies bodies and knowledge are linked together against the backdrop of political frameworks municipal responsibilities national law and international policy regulation see Hird Thus waste is not passively signified It transforms and is transformed by the very networks in which it is produced Roshizawa and Hird In her analysis of how waste unfolds as social relations and materializations at vari ous scales in different contexts Gille offers the notion of a waste regime She states that social institutions determine what waste is considered valuable in a society and can be studied at both the macro and microlevels or rather how they interplay the concept of waste regime extends attention to the very production of waste and allows us to understand the economic social and cultural origins of specific wastes as well as the logic of their generation p Using Gilles concept of waste regimes we approach contemporary Swedish politics practices and materializations of transforming household food leftovers into valuable commodities ie the nonfossil fuel of biogas and biofertilizer As mentioned above Sweden has for decades aimed to become a green superpower Ideland In line with this national branding and building on for example an extensive social moral legal and material system for recycling and decreasing pollution the government communicated a national strategy for CE Regeringskansliet The aim is to make Sweden the first fossilfree country in the world through shifting patterns of production consumption and recycling The public sector the industry and the civil society are key actors in the striving for a better world Political will material conditions and cultural norms are assembled to transform waste into something desirable and valuable However studies on how the CE is understood and played out address the tension between the political will to uphold an idea of circularity and the impossibility of doing so in practice Winans et al for Swedish cases see eg Corvellec Rosenlund Holmberg and Ideland As also mentioned above the basic logic of CE is that the resource model counters that of extractproduceusedump Kirchherr et al conceptualize the CE as an economic system that is based on business models which replace the endoflife concept with reducing alternatively reusing and recycling materials in production distribution and consumption processes pp f The CE aims to accomplish sustainable development environmentally economically and socially reached through practices at different levels creating flows of circularity and regenerativity for material and energy within a society Korhonen et al The regime of CE which has informed for example EU policy since the s builds on a waste hierarchy that prioritizes management methods on the basis of environmental benefit from waste prevention at the top to disposal at the bottom Gregson et al Hultman and Corvellec The less transformation of material and energy during the process the better In other words reuse via flea markets is more resource efficient than food waste processing which necessarily involves inflows and resource and energy leaks Kirchherr et al Alexander and Reno state that the contemporary recycling discourse is the extent to which the idea of a perfect circle is taken for reality Valenzuela and Bhm claim that the zero waste CE is a capitalistic dream a zerowaste gloss results paradoxically in the arousal of a fetishistic desire to consume them more intensely and thus to keep up the wasting of their leftover parts It is not hard to see the appeal of the idea of endless recycling It is precisely because this model is so elevated in both the instructive and academic literature that it is important that the circular economy be subjected to critique Gregson et al Research on urban metabolism and science and technology studies have successfully used the lens of maintenancerepair work in showing that breakdowns are part of the production of the thing itself and illustrated the importance of human labor and ingenuity to infrastructural flows Graham and Thrift Abrahamsson in his study on composting and dumpster diving states that food is a fragile and temporary achievement that is made possible thanks to the infrastructures of maintenance p Ureta approaches waste management as a kind of care involving tinkering practices and affects but also as a form of power since the caring is to set up the conditions Waste management is thus far from just a technical system Building on this scholarship while focusing on the avoidance of disruptions of the neatness of circularity we introduce makeup work as a useful concept for studying how the waste regime of CE is played out on the micro level where it is defended but also challenged Speaking with Gille the focus on makeup work helps us under stand the cultural production of waste values in a specific context The approach seeks to understand how the zerowaste gloss see Valenzuela and Bhm is upheld in the Swedish CE regime and how it is necessary for the transformation of food leftovers into bus fuel Studying the production and transformation of values through work allows us to scale in and out between workers and regimes Makeup work thus builds on the repair or maintenance approach However it adds an additional layer with its double meaning Makeup work covers cracks on the surface but more importantly it implies that the assumed tidiness of circularity like any aesthetic quality does not come naturally but is continuously made We conceptualize makeup work as concerted and organized acts that paint the neatness of and in effect closes the circle This theoretical Journal of Material Culture approach informs the methodological approach that allows us to deepen our understand ing of how the abstract concept of CE takes material shape through work Methodology Trashtracing In order to study the flow from discarded food to biogas as well as how interruptions in the CE are handled and solved through makeup work we employ the method of trashtracing This actionoriented approach means we avoid starting from the top of the organization and studying down but rather follow the trash in order to get a grip on waste regimes This approach is inspired by Kopytoff who argued for investigating the cultural biography of things to examine the trajectories of objects as they go through material and value transformations Tracing food waste from household deposits through the transformation into biogas we encounter a number of valueadding waste workers and have interviewed of them in three Swedish municipalities Gvle Malm and Uppsala The informants were chosen based on their key positions regarding their specific expertise in waste management They are mainly positioned within the municipal organization CEOs city planners communication officers maintenance permit and legal experts Commonly they have a higher education background eg in engineering or communication A large propor tion have extensive experience from working with the organization for example Lottie quoted later on who is a manager at a large food waste plant and has been working herself up the ladder for years Actors from the commercial sector include directors of recycling plants local managers and marketers their firms being highly visible in the sustainability branch One such interviewee is Leif a civil engineer who is specialized in energy systems and works with biofuel development for an international group of companies The interviews lasted between one and three hours they were then transcribed and analysed in different steps The transcripts were first manually coded at a content level In a second analytical step quotes from relevant codes such as waste as resource value biogas production bio fertilizer torching etc were extracted and analysed in depth From there we identified the leaks and inflows as well as paradoxes and ironies of the wasteasresource paradigm In order to report the analysis we selected examples illustrative of the complexities of the CE and how these are dependent on actors knowledge skills and conditions being invaluable to value production Transformations As stated above the Swedish national goal is that municipalities should make use of at least percent of their food waste SOU Individual municipalities may have even more ambitious goals However the common denominator is that there are numerical goals towards which they work Different actors play different roles along the path of transformation of household food leftovers through the processing plant to the biogas production facility Citizensconsumers communicators environmental strategists engineers companies and new consumers all contribute to keeping the CE of food waste up and running through the mundane practices of making things workHolmberg and Ideland Step Refining leftovers Successful management of the first step of our trashtracing depends on the everyday unpaid waste work performed by citizens But citizens are not reliable as a group because they do not always do as they are told even when it is supposedly easy Of the food waste that is thrown away percent is sorted incorrectly and to a large extent becomes residual wastetoenergy material In an international comparative perspective these are exceptionally good numbers but in the Swedish context the aims at the municipal level are set even higher In order to avoid this waste of leftovers public authorities do what they can to make it as easy as possible to contribute to the CE for example through PR campaigns such as Dont make it harder see Figure This advertisement was placed at for example bus stops and distributed to consum ers via mail It states sort the garbage throw the bag in the food bin done You have saved the Earth Decompostable brown bags such as the one depicted have become iconic symbols of food recycling in Sweden The cost of the bags is covered by the waste management fee and the bags are typically distributed to households or available at recycling stations or grocery stores The bags come with careful instructions the goal being to make people want to vol untarily sort discarded items and do it correctly First to use the bags correctly there must be a definition of what food waste is for example what should be sorted into the bags Typically food waste is anything left over that cant be saved after preparing or eating food V ASyd The list of food categories includes meat eggshells bread and coffee filters Instructions say to combine them to assemble food stuff that is not usually mixed Mixing organic things is the starting point for the composition of new material and the process of compostation The process taking place within the bag might become messy with dripping or even broken bags resulting in reluctance It is however a challenge to teach citizens to use them correctly Thus the bags come with information Figure Dont make it harder wwwgordetintesvararese Journal of Material Culture and advice on doing this in the right way on how to achieve less moisture fewer odours and maybe most important of all how to prevent the full bag with messy leftovers from falling apart In one of the municipalities studied the brown bags had just been introduced According to Oscar who has insight into the project one material condition that seems to be crucial for success is the container that holds the bag because it prevents dripping and odour At the same time Oscar thinks that people usually do not care that much or at least that the potential lack of dryness is not of great concern smell and dampness foremost are some of the things that you notice as the biggest challenge with it right But the challenge is not so big that it makes people stop or dislike the system which is also worth noting They see the challenges but theyre at an everyday level so you dont worry so much about them Oscar Countering the general impression he points out that although the challenge is the smell and dampness when considered in an everyday perspective perhaps the problem is not as great as the policy implication workers imagine As pointed out by Douglas paying close attention to the combination of form and formlessness is essential if one wishes to understand dirt Here the clean waste is produced through typically dirty practices mixing categories or forms of stuff and letting them mould together into formlessness By becoming too wet or smelly the contents of the bag threaten to become sticky as liminal matter between solid and fluid fluid and gas Following Sartre Douglas expands on stickiness as an unstable crosssection of a transformation process But stickiness is also enriching one learns through sensuous experiences about the world p and perhaps some dirt can be tolerated or even welcomed by consumers if it is constructed as a sustainability object within the CE Corvellec The next critical step of the process of producing clean food waste is to place the bags in the right container for later transportation to the plant a functioning infrastructure of disposal is needed for sorting and collecting food waste that is as pure as possible After sorting the right stuff into the brown bag you also need to throw it into the right bin distinguishing catering waste from residual waste Several material conditions need to be fulfilled The bins should be clearly marked and coloured so that you do not confuse different kinds of garbage In addition there should be easy access to dustbins and recycle rooms should be clean and safe Osanna who works with sustainable waste management strategies provides a concrete example of how they have worked to fix problems in one of the city districts the recycling rooms were dark disordered scary kind of you dont want to be there it smelled bad and like messy too No order in the placing of bins they were too small the signs hanging crisscrossed They just signalled that this is not important Osanna Making waste recycling matter in this instance means fixing the facilities so that they enable smooth and obstaclefree disposal Architectural disorder and darkness do not contribute to this end but on the contrary signal that recycling is not important Apart from lack of clarity resulting in missorting of waste feelings of insecurity in the waste Holmberg and Ideland rooms often located in the basement of apartment buildings are a recurring theme in the interviews you dont want to be trapped in there Anna Achieving neatness by fixing badly functioning infrastructures for recycling such as ordering and marking dust bins improving lighting and even reconstructing the physical space is considered a successful approach In the cases above it is stressed that such investments in attending to the bins and recycling rooms have increased the amount of sorted food waste and the cleanliness of this fraction In the story outlined above one subtext is the importance of working closely with citi zens for example through neighbourhood projects and campaigns that resonate with everyday practices However authorities may run the risk of transgressing privacy boundaries Anna one of the communicators interviewed tells a story about when gar bage collection truck drivers noted that food waste bins were sometimes empty This emptiness bore witness to a lack of compliance with recycling policies The communication department sent out letters to the property owners involved in essence stating that we have noted that you havent used your food waste bin and we wonder if you need more information or if there is something that does not work Anna Some recipients complained that they felt offended and one even reported it to the State Data Protection Authority The incident made the headlines in the local newspaper Altogether it resulted in acute makeup work for example through chats on the major daily newspapers website excusing and informing as well as trying to restore citizens confidence In this section we have investigated the process of producing clean food waste and focused on makeup work interpreted as the prevention of mess by smoothing the process of recycling The handling of catering waste is culturally viewed as disgusting in many respects During the summer there are fruit flies maggots bad smells and rotten food and the bags are in danger of dissolving and leaking Management of this waste involves infor mation as in the Dont make it harder example and the public letter campaign above or in the organization of waste bins and renovation of recycling rooms Various categories of staff at the studied municipalities put much effort into simplifying recycling and making people feel comfortable and safe when doing so thus accomplishing alignment between policy goals and practice as well as working towards closing the circle However striving for neatness and cleanliness may risk creating a distance and disconnection from the waste thus ultimately reducing responsibilities for the matter Hawkins ix The particular makeup work presented in this section concerns efforts to increase citizen awareness of and essential contribution to policy goals This work foregrounds the supply of material conditions for smooth recycling making it easy to produce high volumes of pure good leftovers For the CE of food waste to work rich good leftovers with the right composition and high degree of purity are needed for the next step of the process the production of slurry Step A feeling for the slurry In two of the studied municipalities the brown bags thrown away in the brown bins are transported by dedicated trucks to a waste plant where they are squeezed and refined into slurry This is more or less a mechanical process Nonorganic material is separated from the substrate together with food that cannot be crushed such as raw potatoes see Figure The outsorted stuff is called rejekt in Swedish and may be transformed into central Journal of Material Culture heating at a wastetoenergy plant The food leftover mixture now wet and fluid and termed slurry is then transported to the biogas production facility This may sound like a straightforward transformation process but slurry is precarious in nature In order to function fully it needs to have the right composition texture dryness etc Although most of these qualities are monitored and fixed according to standards there are still risks of unforeseen hazards that require specific kinds of tinkering in order to produce smooth material slurry that can be digested into energyrich biogas and nutritious biofertilizer To illustrate this we look into the makeup work required to produce good slurry with the right ingredients texture and characteristics Like the process of making good leftovers good slurry does not come naturally We ask how makeup work is done to produce good slurry and how it contributes to upholding circularity As mentioned above one kind of matter that disturbs the smooth process of slurry production is the outofplace waste for example nonorganic stuff that has been thrown into the brown bags The stories about what this stuff can sometimes be are staggering irons fryers and other electronic equipment More ordinary is cutlery that has accidentally been dropped into the brown bag objects that end up in the residual rejekt The number of rejected items seems like a sensitive balancing act as large amounts mean less slurry to digest Lottie This balancing involves economic values but is also important for maintaining public trust in circularity Figure Food waste processing plant Photograph Malin IdelandHolmberg and Ideland While large items such as cutlery are easily sorted out it is more troubling when pieces of fabric get stuck in the screws that are crushing the food The most serious obstacle reoccurring in the interviews is the plastic wrap used in for instance vegetable packaging Plastic interrupts the process partly because it gets stuck in the presses but mainly because it does not get stuck but gets conveyed into the fermentation process and is eventually spread onto farmland Regarding retail food waste plastic packaging more or less stops the waste from getting into the circularity at all Instead just like the rejekt plasticpackaged food is burned to produce central heating It might seem reasonable that items like cutlery and plastic matter are causing problems within the process But the production of good slurry is much more sensitive than that The raw material of the food waste matters Waste workers have developed a certain tacit knowledge over the years through different kinds of experiences For example uncooked carrots and potatoes are too hard to be transformed into slurry hazelnut shells disturb the process and are useless for producing biogas Lottie Citrus fruits can start fermentation that may have disastrous consequences especially in combination with yeast or baking soda In the worstcase scenario the trucks transporting slurry to biogas plants can explode Such incidents can be prevented by staff who have learned to reduce these risks Lottie who has worked for more than years at a food waste processing plant explains You cant do much about Christmas when the citrus fruits come in But sometimes we get large quantities for example of orange juice and then we dont run it all at once you have to take it a bit step by step This is something you learn with time theres no one who has the whole solution saying that this is the way to do it or not Lottie She knows that the composition of food waste unloaded at the plant varies during the year and how the quality depends on upstream actors the origin of deliveries yeast from bakeries juice from food markets and so on Lottie explains that her strategies to prevent fermentation are to divide the waste into fractions making smaller portions and to slow down the production process Actors like Lottie have a good deal of knowledge and practical skills concerning com position problems sugar texture dryness and temperature variation heat gleaned especially from critical moments when things have gone wrong Anders who works at a biogas facility explains First and foremost you have a problem with possible fermentation We see it from the slurry too that at certain periods when the weather gets warm and a lot of sugar substances are in it then it may start fermenting in the trucks And its happened once that we drove from Malm and the driver had to stop halfway and unload some of it Anders Having to unload stinking slurry onto the road is not an ideal situation and does not result in good publicity Makeup work entails ensuring that the transport trucks carry smaller loads which create extra space in case of fermentation Anders provides another example of a compositiongonewrong incident when he experienced a large amount of fat mixing with the slurry Fat is a wellknown problem for sewage water systems but it also causes trouble with slurry because it fluctuates between fluid and solid forms depending on the heat Journal of Material Culture We got tons fat it took me three years to get rid of the problem was that it was liquid right at degrees Celsius but at degrees it was rockhard Anders Here we can discern a peculiar balancing act Anders received a large amount of fat that was almost impossible to digest it took me three years Yet he nonetheless puts time and energy into doing this Here we can discern an interesting moral dimension stuff that can be recycled should be recycled What is potentially a resource should be turned into a resource Devalued solid fat can thanks to Anders skilled efforts become revalued Lucas As pointed out by Reno after having been cast aside tossed around and mixed in with other discarded things waste breaks down and becomes less predictable Reno This is especially true of slurry it should ferment but only in the digester not in the slurrymaker or even worse the truck It has to be separated from the wrong kinds of waste but without producing too much rejekt There is a need for large amounts of material but not to be mixed in any way and not at the cost of including too much packaging material such as plastic And even waste that is of the wrong texture and composition can be turned into a resource the hazelnut shells used in energy production the fat that is slowly slowly transformed into digestible slurry There are no patented solutions to the problems but the waste workers interviewed have developed what we call a feeling for the slurry and an ability to handle problems along the way The feeling for the slurry is acquired with earned skills and knowhow and a great deal of pride The makeup work we have highlighted above concerns the embodied acts that uphold the assumed neatness of circularity Contrary to the discourse of a mechanical almost automatic process the production of good slurry ultimately depends on manual skills and dedication Step Making biogas After the food waste moulds into the messy smelly and potentially unruly slurry the next step is to transform it into green and pure bio fuel Transferred to a biogas plant see Figure the slurry is mixed with fertile mould for example manure or fat in order to achieve the right composition before it ends up in the digestor for about a month Here in an oxygenfree environment anaerobic bacteria can produce potential methane At the ideal temperature of degrees Celsius and with the right quality of their feed the slurry they produce gas which in turn goes through a refinement process reducing carbon oxide and producing the clean methane that is called biogas This biogas is then alone or mixed with fossil natural gas traded on the market as car fuel or as another energy source such as gas heating According to the market logic a balance between demand and supply is strived for a continuous inflow of material needed for the production for example slurry as well as a predictable and profitable outlet of biogas In reality this balance is far from perfect Makeup work is thus involved in the act of balancing supply and demand both a surplus of and a lack of gas threaten to disrupt the final step of the CE of food waste The first problem discussed here is a political one how can we make the transition from petrol to renewable energy when doing so ironically enough requires the inflow of Holmberg and Ideland another fossil fuel natural gas The interviewed waste workers talked about how to adhere to such political incentives in practice in terms of demands on infrastructures the shape of the gas and the location and functions of the biogas plant Sofie who works with coordinating biogas producers regionally describes how biogas production took off in the mids and how they lacked an infrastructure for selling the gas You cannot build a new biogas facility unless you have an outlet for the whole produce And this means that biogas production grows stepwise but the market grows more linearly and then you get these huge gaps Sofie The gaps Sofie talks about are to be found both in the line of consumption cars and buses still run on petrol and in the line of production Gas is a strange matter It cannot easily be transported and even though the outlet varies the gas keeps flowing We have a stop time here for several weeks so we cant just open and close the taps and stop producing gas Anders One solution to the problem of maintaining continuous flows is to mix it with natural gas Erik who manages a biogas plant states We sat there with a stateoftheart facility fantastic really It was amazingly nice with this gas and we had new gas buses But we had no fluid biogas and the facility could not digest compressed gas So the first thing I had to do was to make a deal with natural gas Erik Figure Biogas site Kristianstad Photograph Malin Ideland Journal of Material Culture Ironically then stable use of fossil fuel is more or less necessary to uphold the supply of fossilfree fuel The production needs to be ongoing and biogas is an object that needs to be handled with care and knowledge just like the brown bags and the slurry the biogas is slippery It does not adapt to the political or material conditions but needs to be in a flow constantly produced and consumed So even if the inflow of fossil gas risks disturbing the neatness of the circularity through a disconnection of the straight relation between biogas and climatefriendliness Corvellec it is crucial to the CE of food Another way to practically handle the lack and instability of biogas production is to mix it with imported gas Southern Sweden eg Malm is experiencing a lack of biogas and solving this problem by adding natural gas as well as Danish biogas Leif The commercial energy company Eon which distributes the biogas at ordinary gas stations in the whole region also runs biogas plants in Denmark The Municipality of Gvle serves as a contrast Just like Malm Gvle invests heavily in living up to the national as well as environmental goals of sorting out larger proportions of food waste and replacing fossil fuel when providing an alternative However while Eon thrives on an extensive infrastructural system including gas stations Ekogas annually produces a negative balance and cannot offer more than a few gas stations Because of the lack of gas pipes and other infrastructure for transport and refuelling at the time of the interviews Gvle was underconsuming gas leading to overproduction and the need for leaks to maintain circularity Given that biogas cannot currently be stored to any greater extent one kind of makeup work was to sell the biogas cheap to a local industry for heating and energy The other was to let out that is to torch a rather large proportion of it The torching of biogas has not been the focus of public debate This lack of media attention is in a way fortunate for producers as such attention would put the promise of the CE of food at risk If my banana peel is not turned into bus fuel this can be considered a waste of the resource that leftovers are supposed to be Olle who manages a biogas plant explains what happened when their torching unwillingly became the focus of media attention Of course it upsets the public It was what they chose to focus on and we had really started out very smoothly with production and produced more than we actually first expected then if you increase production and dont have a market for that gas then of course it will get torched Olle It is suggested that torching biogas is the result of a lack of readiness on the part of the market Better and more intense marketing is the strategy promoted However Olle still worries about what this does to the political climate around the CE paradoxically enough overproduction could kick back as an excuse for not investing in the infrastructures necessary to counteract underconsumption A moral economy of resource recovery is produced through different social relations and material conditions Gregson et al Examining the work inside the CE we see quite a paradoxical situation in which the supply and demand of fuel do not always adjust to each other The production of biogas requires both leaks torching and inflows fossil gas in order to keep up with the material conditions and the policy for infrastructure and energy transition Today there is a risk that the electrification of cars and buses will become a problem for the CE of food Holmberg and Ideland waste The user of commodified gas is predominantly the public transport system city and regional buses In the recently published white paper on biogas SOU the need to mix biogas with fossil gas is also suggested as a necessity for the transition towards renewable energy Actors along the chain do not just need the right tools for refining leftovers and a finegrained feeling for the slurry but also the infrastructures and political conditions for handling the volatility of biogas From this example we can discern decircularity as refined biogas becomes the new waste We also notice how human labour and the innovative ideas of stabilization supply and destabilization torching are both repairing and creating leaks in an attempt to keep the circle going see Roshizawa and Hird The underlying narrative of CE is that of a market where demand and supply harmonize The makeup work highlighted concerns efforts to align uneven production and consumption In order to close the circle waste workers juggle with importing gas mixing with natural gas and torching Mobilizing fossil fuels and burning nonfossil fuels are needed in order to produce the sustainability object of biogas Discussion As has been argued food waste management is far from circular By spotting and analysing interruptions of the circle we unblackbox Graham and Thrift the practices upholding the CE while recognizing the makeup work done mobilizing citizens responsibility capitalizing on workers tacit skills as well as covering unsustainable energy use The empirical contribution of the present article is that it pays attention to interruptions leaks inflows and practices along the waste chain and how they are handled at the microlevel in order to keep the circle In the first step we detect a number of the social and material strategies used to produce as much clean waste as possible including neat disposal rooms information campaigns and brown bags handed out accompanied by tips on how to use them and avoid disgust Materiality matters when fostering citizens to produce clean waste thus enabling further processing In the second section we focus on how waste is carefully transformed into potent slurry Not all food waste behaves in the same way and the waste workers develop a feeling for the slurry which helps them to dose and mix the messy stuff In other words the makeup work performed entails a careful mix of raw materials to produce valuable slurry In the third step we visit the biogas plant At this point the main makeup work concerns the act of juggling supply and demand both the surplus and lack of gas might interrupt the view of the valuable gas as a sustainability object Corvellec Again the right mixture is required to acquire a pure product The slurry needs to be mixed with grease and manure to get the right degree of wetness and the right conditions for the methaneproducing bacteria to thrive In addition the refined gas might need to be blended with natural gas to enable an even distribution on the market Balancing supply and demand to uphold the flow and securing value is demanding but potentially profitable work Taken together this analysis demonstrates the particularities of the creative and moral work of transforming degraded household food leftovers into valuable commodities and redevalued outflows The moral commitments expressed by the interviewees is crucial to the CE Gregson et al The particular analytical contribution we bring to the field of waste studies is the concept of makeup work With its focus on practice the concept allows us to understand Journal of Material Culture how policy is performed and thus what pitfalls it may face In addition the concept reveals how the transformation and refinement of heterogenous matter such as food waste involve practices of cleaning that in turn generate new waste We ask for alternative strategies such as prevention of waste Edensor who investigates ruins and ruined objects states that the disordering and dislocation of the material world might create alternative interpretations experiences and materializations Makeup work also enables us to analytically bind together entire waste flows while attending to the specificities and micro practices of each step Each step requires different closings of the circle through patchwork handling in and outflows or translations Makeup work capitalizes on its double meaning First it highlights the covering of cracks needed in order to transform waste to energy Second makeup work pinpoints that the neatness of circularity is far from a straightforward technical system but is continuously made As stated we start from the perspective of a waste regime which draws attention to the specificities of the institutional origin of waste and its generation Gille In the Swedish CE regime the policy discourse focuses on behavioural modifications and the motivations of citizens to sort out their food waste However there are more crucial dilemmas connected to conditions that are rarely highlighted in public Problems such as lack of or misfit material difficulties in sorting the substrate effectively overunderproduction of gas and the political decisions dictating the conditions for supply and demand are equally crucial and pose the threat that the production will be viewed as inefficient Furthermore by making these factors visible a system built on the trust of citizens might be challenged and questioned However adding complexity to the simplistic wasteasresource paradigm is necessary if we wish to stop our escalating consumption and the dream of endless recycling Valenzuela and Bhm If for any reason my banana peel is not turned into biogas perhaps I would consider buying more locally produced fruit In this article we engage critically with the zerowaste discourse hoping to ensure that waste stays on the agenda Funding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research authorship andor publication of this article The article is an
