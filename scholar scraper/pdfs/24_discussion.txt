on extensive engagement with key stakeholder groups. 
This plan includes:
• One-on-one discussions and roundtable meetings with stakeholders, comprising waste collectors, municipal authorities, NGOs, recyclers and dismantlers, estab-lished and non-established supply chain entities, and others.
• Separate interactions with domestic consumers to under -
stand their awareness levels and expectations.
• Development of an implementation strategy and corre-sponding Action Plan to be carried out over the short term (2 years) and long term (5 years) by the concerned stakeholders.
Table  1 provides a detailed summary of the Strategic 
Action Plan. (A list of acronyms used appears at the end of the paper).
Step 3 Knowledge dissemination
The Action Plan was disseminated through a variety of 
channels including WISE and OSU websites, stakeholder 
websites, email blasts, and social media. Additionally, focus group meetings were held to ensure the feasibility of plan implementation. The final report of the WISE project has met with wide acceptability among city officials and key stakeholders across the value chain. In particular, the WISE team briefed the Joint Municipal Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, PMC and other key stakeholders, and received an enthusiastic response (see Fig.  4). It appears that the rec-
ommended Strategic Action Plan can pave the way for more informed decisions by policy-makers and e-waste chain par -
ticipants, leading to development of a circular economy in Pune.
The following summarizes the strategic action recom -
mendations that were developed in this project.
• Draft guidelines for streamlining e-waste management in Pune; prescribe rules, regulations, and penalties, if any; define stakeholder roles, and integrate these into a circular economy framework.
• Conduct a baseline study to assess and evaluate the total consumption of resources in the electronics sector and the e-waste generated, thus enabling adoption of suit-able benchmarks and targets for reducing e-waste. Such a study would also be relevant for national-level targets.
• Develop a long-term resource efficiency strategy for Pune that would strive for a circular economy, reducing both virgin resource use by manufacturers and consumer con-sumption.
• Develop guidelines for mandating a certain percentage of recycled e-waste in manufacturing. This will enable strengthening of the formal e-waste sector (similar to the renewable purchase obligation that mandates a certain percentage of renewable energy in power purchases).
• Conduct impact assessment studies to analyze the health, environmental and economic impacts of improper e-waste recycling by the informal sector in Pune, and at a national level.
• Organize capacity building training programs and work -
shops (by PMC) for the formal and (especially) informal sectors, on the adverse health and environmental impacts of handling, dismantling, and recycling e-waste in an improper and unscientific manner.
• Develop appropriate business and financial models for a circular e-waste economy that would attract more fund-ing from private institutions into the electrical and elec-tronics sector.
• Undertake studies and organize conferences, seminars, community drives and workshops to educate citizens about the value of adopting a more sustainable lifestyle.
• Carry out feasibility studies for designing ‘product ser -
vice systems’ that would integrate products, services, supporting networks and infrastructure, to reduce waste and form a circular economy.
• Conduct research to facilitate adoption of the ‘cradle-to-cradle’ approach, transitioning from a resource-inten-sive to a resource-efficient economy that decouples the environmental footprint from economic prosperity and human well-being (i.e., doing more with less for longer).
Case study: waste management system 
for rural villages
The Social Work and Research Centre, widely known as 
Barefoot College, is a voluntary organization founded by Bunker Roy in 1972. Full-time volunteers are working in the fields of education, skill development, health, drinking water, women empowerment and electrification through solar power for the upliftment of rural people.
Rural areas of India present a different set of challenges 
from those that exist in densely populated cities. In rural villages, there tends to be a lack of understanding of the importance of personal hygiene and proper waste disposal. The objective of this seed grant was to establish and dem-onstrate a low-cost, end-to-end rural solid waste manage -
ment model that is designed by the local community. This model aims to ensure sanitation, environmental protection, and income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. Thus, the project not only addresses the UN SDGs mentioned earlier—responsible consumption and human health—but also contributes to poverty elimination (Goal 1), clean water (Goal 6), and sustainable communities (Goal 11).
