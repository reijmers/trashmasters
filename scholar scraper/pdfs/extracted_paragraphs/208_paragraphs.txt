Food waste reduction is one of  the top priorities under the recent European Union ’s CE Package. It also contributes to achieving the United  Nations ’ Sustainable Development Goals . While food loss and waste  prevention and man- agement are well-studied in the literature, research in CE is more recent. Through a systematic literature review,  this study creates a taxonomy that synthesises the key aspects of FLW under the CE. 297 papers were reviewed  and analysed using keyword co-occurrence analysis  and structural dimension analysis. In KCN, three  research themes emerge: impact assessment, biorefinery, and nutrient recycling. Structural dimension analysis  reveals the types of research methods, types of FLW flows, FLW prevention and management options with  associated opportunities and challenges, and the sustainability impact assessment  addressed in the liter- ature. A taxonomy is presented and future research directions are highlighted under six research streams: i) FLW  supply and quantification, ii) practices and technological aspects, iii) logistics and supply chain management, iv)  market demand, v) SIA, and vi) policy and legislation. Combining insights from CE and FLW prevention and  management, the taxonomy helps key stakeholders, including industry practitioners to grasp new business op- portunities, politicians to set up support strategies and strategic development plans, society to recognise the  benefits of waste-oriented bioeconomy, and consumers to raise their awareness and be actively involved in CE.    1.Introduction  A third of the annual food produced for human consumption   is either wasted or lost along the food supply  chain  . Food loss and waste  accounts for  24% of freshwater use, 28% of total global cropland area, 23% of global  fertiliser use  and about 8% (3.3 Gtonnes of CO2  equivalent) of total greenhouse gas  emissions .  Halving the amount of FLW could contribute to reducing GHG emission  from food production by 20–30% . While about  10.7% of the world population  is undernourished   and by 2050 9.6 billion people will need to be  adequately fed , wasting foods represents a  contemporary economic, environmental, social and ethical challenge on  a global scale, which requires urgent political attention . One of the novel efforts in preventing and  managing FLW is the adoption of the circular economy  concept that  has been supported in the EU political agenda (European Commission,  2015 ). FLW prevention is identified as the top priority and an integral  part of an EU Action Plan for its transition towards the CE. The CE Action  Plan not only puts forward a series of actions to promote more sus- tainable production and consumption behaviours and patterns in EU  food system, e.g. food donation and labelling awareness, but also fosters  the adoption of bio-technologies and practices to convert FLW into a  variety of valuable bio-based products for long-term socio-economic and  environmental benefits (Maina et al., 2017 ; Zabaniotou and Kamaterou,  2019 ). In the Action Plan, a common EU methodology for FLW quanti - fication is also proposed to ensure the consistent quantification, moni - toring, and analysis of FLW statistics. These measures support the EU on  its trajectory towards meeting the United Nations ’ Sustainable  *Corresponding author.  E-mail address: N.Q.Do-2016@hull.ac.uk .

As the instrumental role in the transition towards the CE, FLW has  gained momentum in the CE-related academic discourse with expo- nential growth in related publications over the last five years (Kyr- iakopoulos et al., 2019 ). To better position our study and highlight our  contribution to this significant and ever-increasing published research  base, we have examined a considerable amount of extant literature that  deals with FLW in the CE. Appendix 1 presents a summary of these  studies, providing authors ’ names, year of publication, the number of  articles reviewed and main focuses in term of stages of the supply chain,  waste prevention and management options, and the considered evalu - ation criteria. The earliest was published in 2014. This extensive list is  grouped into seven focused topic areas:  FLW conversion technologies   biorefinery models  life cycle assessment  methods for FLW  prevention and management routes  methods for quantifying the  FLW flows  FLW-related policies  the FLW hierarchy framework   FLW prevention behaviours. The difference between the first two  topics lies in the cascading concept, where the former focuses on a  specific technology, while the latter aims at a combination of multiple  technologies for a plethora of outputs. Although the prior literature re- views represent the crucial starting point for our study, two limitations  are identified. First, their focus is constrained to a specific topic area,  predominantly focused on technological feasibility in a fragmented  manner. Since FLW in the CE thinking is a complex and multi-faceted  issue that cannot be attributed to a single variable (Schanes et al.,  2018 ; Kyriakopoulos et al., 2019 ), a singular or micro perspective is not  recommended. Otherwise, the CE discourse is simply a refurbished  notion of the triple R principle – reduce, reuse, recycle, where a single  solution is chosen according to the environmental criteria (Crist ˘obal  et al., 2018a , 2018b ; Ingrao et al., 2018 ), while economic and social  evaluations, as well as the optimal cascade of individual bioprocesses for  the authentic transformation of the linear to the circular economy   are completely neglected. Second, the review  protocol in many cases is not illustrated. As such, most papers either do  not mention the number of reviewed articles or review a limited set of  articles with unclear selection criteria. This narrative method of syn- thesising previous studies is criticised as being devoid of replicability,  transparency and thoroughness and thus can be biased by the re- searchers in making sense of extant literature .  We, therefore, attempt to overcome these limitations.  As shown in Appendix 1, our scope includes the above-mentioned  topic areas in order to provide a comprehensive literature review. We  considered 297 articles published in all areas of focus and all stages of  the supply chain, irrespective of the chosen FLW prevention and man- agement options that are linked to the CE and FLW. We have chosen a  systematic literature review  method over other review approaches  because of its replicable and transparent process, which contributes to  giving a balanced and unbiased result . The main  objectives of this extensive review are threefold:  to offer an analytical  overview of existing research relying on bibliometric tools, such as  keyword co-occurrence analysis;  to carry out the structural dimen - sion analysis on research methodology, FLW types, FLW prevention and  management options with the associated opportunities and challenges,  and sustainability assessment indicators;  to derive a taxonomy  framework for the classification of the critical aspects of the reviewed  papers and offer potential future research avenues.  After the introduction, the paper proceeds as follows. Theoretical  background  sheds light on the FLW definitional scoping,  concept of CE and its relevant principles in FLW prevention and man- agement. The SLR methodology is presented in Section 3, which is fol- lowed by a keyword co-occurrence network analysis to identify  emerging research themes  and structural dimension analysis  to critically appraise different relevant dimensions . The discussion  encapsulates current research lines and proposes  the research agenda. The conclusions and limitations of this study are  presented in Section 7.  2.Theoretical background  2.1. FLW definitional scoping – a review boundary  Clearly stating the boundaries of the topic is essential when per- forming a SLR. This is of great importance due to a lack of consensus  with reference to a precise definition of food loss and waste resulting in  an interchangeable use of the concepts of loss and waste .  The existence of multiple FLW definitions complicates the data collec - tion and comparability of FLW levels , chal- lenges the measure of the distance towards the SDG 12.3 target  , and hampers the analysis of FLW .  FLW definitions are different in two major aspects: the types of wastes   and the boundaries in the FSC to be  included . For instance, FAO  define  FLW as “the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply  chain ”, but distinguish food loss from food waste based on the stages of  the FSC. Food loss refers to the amount of the edible parts of crops,  livestock and fish leaving the upper part of the FSC – from the  post-harvesting, slaughtering, and catching stage up to but not including  the retail stage – by being discarded or disposed of or incinerated (FAO,  2019 ). These stages typically consist of storage, transportation, pro- cessing and importing activities. Food waste arises at the downstream  stages from retail to the consumption points. Of note, the FLW ’s scope  under the FAO ’s conceptual framework excludes not only inedible parts  of foods but also the edible foods that are destined to an economically  productive non-food use, such as animal feeds or industrial use. FU- SIONS  , on the other hand, does include both edible and inedible  parts of foods in its proposed FLW definition, but it does not distinguish  food loss and food waste. FUSIONS  defined food waste as  foods that “are removed from  the food supply  chain ” and flow into nine destinations. FUSIONS  also highlighted  the difference between food surplus and food waste . Although food sur- plus is still a part of FSC and fit for human consumption, it would end up  as waste if no prevention or reuse is carried out. As a result, prevention  and redistribution to humans are only applicable to food surplus (Ng  et al., 2019 ). While the paper acknowledges differences between various  concepts, the scope of FLW terminology used hereinafter in this review  paper will encompass food losses, food wastes, edible and inedible  portions of food loss and wastes as well as food surplus that arise from all  stages of the FSC.  2.2. Circular economy concept  A circular economy is defined as “an industrial system that is restorative  or regenerative by intention and design ” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation,  2012 , p. 7). According to Bocken et al.  , the CE includes strategies  for closing, slowing or narrowing resource loops. Closing completes a  resource circle by connecting the post-use of a resource with the pro- duction stage via recycling, while slowing loops reduces the speed of  resource flow by extending the in-use period with long-life design  and/or maintenance, repairs, remanufacturing services. Finally, nar- rowing the loop means lowering resources embedded in each product.  The CE concept cannot be traced back to any particular authors or  dates but is rather considered as the synthesis of various schools of  thought, prominently cradle-to-cradle philosophy, performance econ- omy, blue economy, biomimicry, and industrial ecology (Ghisellini  et al., 2016 ; Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ; Merli et al., 2018 ). The  cradle-to-cradle philosophy fosters the superior design of products for  1 For example: shells, peels, bones, pulps, husks, leaves, pomaces. Q. Do et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 3longer use, continuous recovery and re-utilisation (McDonough and  Braungart, 2010). This philosophy regards all materials made of two  distinct types of nutrients: technical and biological. Food is classified as  consumable products made of non-toxic and beneficial biological nutri- ents that can be safely re-introduced to the biosphere, either directly or  via a cascade of consecutive use, to build natural capital. This biological  metabolism is in contrast with durable products made of technical nu- trients  that are not suitable for returning safely to  the biosphere and should be designed with minimal energy and the  highest quality retention. Building upon cradle-to-cradle philosophy,  the CE also drives a shift in the material composition of consumable  items from technical towards biological nutrients to make products  serving a restorative purpose, e.g. via the use of bio-degradable instead  of single-use food packages. Building on performance economy, the CE  focuses on the products’ performance, such as having an extended life  cycle and consuming less energy and resources . Adopting  the blue economy principles, the CE encourages the use of resources in a  cascading manner and promotes the use of one person’s wastes as re- sources for others, as well as minimising resource leakage .  The cascade principle urges the sequential and consecutive utilisation of  resources to maximise economic returns. For instance, food waste is  used to extract bioactive compounds first before the residues of this  process are used for lower value energy and composting production.  Stimulated by biomimicry, the CE aims at emulating a natural  self-sustaining ecosystem where the movement of biomaterials follows a  continuous circular flow without wastes . Take a tree as  an example. The dead leaves are decomposed into minerals to be  absorbed by the tree to generate new leaves circularly. Ideally, our food  system can be designed following this natural regenerative mechanism.  Essential nutrients  that have been taken  by plants and animals can be fed back into the environment. Inspired by  industrial ecology, the CE supports the establishment of the industrial  symbiosis concept, which involves the mutually beneficial exchanges of  materials, energy, water, and wastes between parties with geographic  proximity to design out waste .  2.3. Circular economy principles in FLW prevention and management  The essence of the CE provided in section 2.2 can be translated into  FLW prevention and management following six principles outlined  below:    Circling longer principle: To keep foods in use longer by  extending their shelf-life and re-distributing surplus foods for  human consumption, which contributes to lowering the amount  of FLW generated (inspired by the cradle-to-cradle philosophy  and performance economy)    Cascading principle: To maximise economic value extracted from  all substances of FLW in a cascaded manner following the  biomass value pyramid,2 rather than converting all food waste  products into low-value energy generation (inspired by the blue  economy)    Regenerative principle: To re-introduce the biological nutrients  back into the soil; promote the generation of renewable energy  from FLW to reduce intake of virgin materials; and ideally erad- icate resource leakage associated with incineration and landfills  .    Inner circle principle: To promote surplus prevention and surplus  reuse, followed by recycling and recovery so as to minimise the  need for tapping into new materials.   Pure circle principle: To preserve a certain quality level in FLW  collection via separation and to encourage the use of short-lived  products made of bio-based instead of fossil-based materials, e.g.  biodegradable plastics .    Industrial symbiosis principle: To promote the exchange of FLW  as resources at the local scale and regional scale (inspired by  industrial ecology)  These underlying principles fundamentally transform FLW preven - tion and management under the CE landscape beyond the food waste  hierarchy. The waste hierarchy, built upon the European Waste  Framework Directive  dated back to 1975 (the current version in  2008 with an amendment in 2018), provides an order of preference for  actions to reduce and manage waste (prevention→ reuse→ recycle→  recovery → disposal). This preference order is solely based on the overall  environmental outcome. Although the hierarchy encourages the circling  longer  and regenerative principle (recycle and  recovery) of the CE, it disregards other principles, particularly the  cascading principle where economic value is taken into consideration. In  addition, the generic terminologies used in the waste hierarchy are open  to different interpretations by users, especially when applied to a spe- cific industry, such as the food sector , leading  to discrepancies in the literature. To be consistent during the review  process, we highlighted these discrepancies  and elucidated the  meanings for different FLW prevention and management options used in  this SLR. Our scoping encompasses both prevention and management of  FLW, where the former is used to avoid food surplus generation while  the latter refers to reuse, recycle and recovery. Reuse hereinafter only  includes redistribution to people in the form of donations or food  sharing, while recycling and recovery aim at converting FLW into a  range of value-added products, following the biomass value pyramid.  However, we are aware that a few studies might include the animal feed  conversion option in reuse (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2015; Teigiserova et al.,  2020), while prevention might consist of reuse, e.g. following the  approach of the WRAP . This might be  because both prevention and reuse aim to prevent surplus from turning  into wastes. Notably, some papers such as Teigiserova et al. ,  while distinguishing reuse from prevention, listed donation as a pre- vention initiative. Similarly, recycle and recovery options might not  include the generation of higher value products, such as bioactive  compounds  or WRAP ).  Finally, it is noted that two of the three resource management loops, the  closing and slowing  resource loops, are  firmly reflected in the FLW prevention and management. The third,  namely narrowing the loop, is more pertinent to the forward food supply  chain as it advocates more efficiency of production, distribution, and  consumption activities. As such, narrowing the loops, though equally  significant in the CE paradigm, falls outside the scope of this paper.  3.Research methodology  The SLR is a process of “a systematic, explicit, and reproducible design  for identifying, evaluating, and interpreting the existing body of completed  and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars and practitioners”  . The SLR enables a rigorous, impartial, and  literature-wide assessment of extant studies’ outcomes, quality and  design. Following the seminal work for conducting the SLR by Tranfield  et al.  and the content analysis-based literature review method of  Seuring and Gold  that was built on the work of Mayring ,  we organised our reviews in three phases:  Material collection, which consists of the identification of key- words, construction of search strings, and choice of databases to  be investigated.    Material selection and evaluation, which are designed to filter the  relevant papers, known as “review sample”, by applying a series 2 Biomass value pyramid is presented in the paper of Berbel and Posadillo   in the descending order of value as follows: fine and pharmaceutical  products → food and feed → bulk chemicals → biofuels → composts → elec- tricity and heat.

VOSviewer is  chosen to conduct KCN thanks to its straightforward and fast  clustering and visualisation capability for a large number of  journal articles . VOS in VOS- viewer stands for visualisation of similarities – a mapping  technique that is described in-depth in the paper of Van Eck and  Waltman  . For clustering capability, the Smart Local  Moving  algorithm is used. The detailed mathematical  equation of the SLM algorithm is provided in Waltman and van  Eck  .   - Structural dimension analysis: contents of full-text papers were  broken down and coded into four dimensions; each dimension  is further collapsed into associated analytical categories  . Of note, under the dimension of FLW prevention and  management options, associated opportunities and challenges  are coded and presented to further inform this dimension.  NVIVO software is used for its effectiveness in quickly organ - ising and coding a large number of articles in a rigorous and  transparent manner in comparison with manual or Excel  coding.  3.1. Material collection  The choice of keywords was thoroughly discussed and agreed by all  authors to locate scientific contributions that fulfilled the paper ’s ob- jectives. The keywords were divided into two categories and truncated  terms  were used as recommended in Gimenez and Tachizawa   to expand the range of possible studies found:  - Keywords related to FLW topic: (loss OR waste OR leftover OR  surplus OR by-products) AND ;   - Keywords related to the Circular Economy topic: (“circular  economy ” OR “circular bioeconomy ” OR “industrial symbiosis ” OR  “circular*" OR “closed-loop ” OR “reduce, reuse, recycle ” OR “three  R∕∕OR “triple R∕∕OR “waste hierarchy")  The keywords were queried on two databases, Scopus and Web of  Science , which are considered the most comprehensive databases  of peer-reviewed journals that store a broad range of scientific papers  .  Additionally, both databases have been used extensively in producing  SLR in the field of circular economy (Homrich et al., 2018 ; Merli et al.,  2018 ; Türkeli et al., 2018 ; Sehnem et al., 2019 ) and FLW management  . The  merging of two databases is beneficial in order to increase the likelihood  of finding all the relevant contributions and to provide a high level of  rigour in searching and selecting the papers to be included in the  Fig. 1.Food waste prevention and management options – Terminology review.

Of note, in WoS the  research field was “Topic” (Title, Author Keywords, Abstract, Keyword  Plus”), while in Scopus, the search field was “Title, Author, Keywords,  Abstract”. No chronological restriction was employed. The queries were  performed on August 10, 2020. The search on Scopus returned 1276  papers and 1011 papers were obtained from WoS.  3.2. Material selection and evaluation  3.2.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria  To focus the research on the topic under investigation, these papers  are then screened in this step by applying a series of inclusion and  exclusion criteria.    Only select peer-reviewed articles written in English  o Excluding 357 papers in Scopus and 103 papers in WoS  o Including: 919 papers in Scopus and 908 papers in WoS    Duplication removal between two databases:   ⇨ Removing overlapping between Scopus and WoS ,  keeping 243 papers exclusively found in Scopus and 232 pa- pers exclusively found in WoS. The result suggested that  74.44% of publications in Scopus were covered by WoS;  73.56% of WoS records were covered by Scopus.   ⇨ Total papers for further review: 1151 papers in both sources.    Abstract screening focusing on two criteria:   - Food loss, food wastes and surplus are the central themes of the  analysis. Other types of wastes: wastewater, sludge, urban  wastes, or animal manures, wools, wood, etc that are not  related to FLW prevention and management are excluded.  Plastic wastes are only included if they are linked to the FLW  discourse, such as the output products  or their role  in reducing FLW.   - Articles that convey the key principles of the circular economy  that are aligned with the six principles discussed in Section 2.3  and related terms, closed-loop supply chain, industrial symbi - osis, triple R, and waste hierarchy.   ⇨ Only papers meeting two criteria are selected leaving us with  365 papers.    Full-text papers are then retrieved and thoroughly reviewed for  their relevance with the research objectives.  o Irrelevant papers: 78 papers  o Total full-text papers retained for review: 287 papers.    All references in the papers in our sample in step  were  checked. This led to an addition of 21 papers, out of which 10  were found relevant and added to the sample.  o A final sample size: 297 papers  This entire selection process is done by three reviewers to remove the  selection bias associated with the subjective judgment of the inclusion/  exclusion process .  3.2.2. Initial screening  Initial screening aims to observe the historical development, the  commonly targeted journals for publications, and geographical distri - bution of the articles in the research topic. Prior to 2014, studies in this  area were scarce. The first publication was recorded as early as 2002 by  Moen  who investigated the eco-circularity concept to convert  FLW into compost in local areas. Five years later, Man and Wenhu   constructed a theoretical circular agricultural system where FLW  like crop straws are utilised to produce fertilisers and energy. Zhao et al.   optimised the circular production for paddy rice, fungus, fertil- isers and biogas considering economic and ecological benefits. Li et al.   underlined the role of earthworms in the CE transition by turning  food wastes into feeds, fertilisers, and input materials for biochemical  and pharmaceutical sectors. It was not until 2015 – right after the  introduction of the CE Action Plan in Europe in 2014 – that interest in the FLW and the CE began to take off in academia .  In term of targeted journals , the Journal of Cleaner Pro- duction attracted the highest number of publications, followed by Bio- resource Technology, Resource Conservation and Recycling, Waste  Management, Sustainability, Renewable and sustainable energy re- views. These journals combined account for more than 30% of total  publications in the review sample. Although the FLW topic under the CE  landscape can be linked to multiple research fields, the topics of the  review papers fit well within the scope of these journals, which epito - mises biotechnological advances and the sustainability paradigm.  In term of geographical distribution, the majority of the articles are  linked to European countries, particularly Italy and the UK . The  USA and China are the only two non-European countries in the top ten  countries with the highest number of affiliations. It is noted that only  158 papers specified the country where the research took place ;  and 73% of these studies were carried out in the EU, notably in Italy and  the UK. 9% of the studies are linked to developing countries. The  popularity of the publications in the EU and China reflects the alignment  with increased interest from companies and policymakers in these re- gions. This finding is also consistent with other CE literature review  papers .  4.Keyword co-occurrence analysis  KCN treats each keyword as a node and each co-occurrence of a pair  of words as a link between those two words. Keywords are extracted  from Author Keywords and Index Keywords fields in the Scopus and  WoS database of the review sample. The use of keywords requires the  pre-processing step. Words that are in structured abstracts (e.g. ‘arti- cles’, ‘industry’, ‘analysis’, ‘priority journal’) were removed. Words that  offer the same meaning but in different formats are adjusted using a  thesaurus file (e.g. anaerobic-digestion and anaerobic digestion, by-  products and byproducts, fertiliser and fertilizers).  The VOSviewer’s SLM algorithm divided keywords into clusters that  determine the relatedness of the keywords; this implies that the larger  the number of articles in which two terms are both found, the stronger  the relationship between the terms is. If keywords are grouped in the  same cluster represented by the same colour in the map , they are  relatively strongly related to each other and therefore tend to reflect the  same topic. Each keyword is signified by a circle with the attached la- bels, and some labels are not visible to avoid overlapping and ease vis- ualisation. The larger size of the circle reflects the more frequent  occurrence of the keyword, while the distance between two keywords  offers an approximate indication of the relatedness of the keywords. In  other words, keywords with a higher rate of co-occurrence tend to be  found closer to each other. It should be underlined that the SLM algo- rithm allows one keyword to be assigned to one cluster only; hence, two  keywords in different clusters, if found close to each other, are still  strongly related. A total of 2927 keywords were extracted from 297  Fig. 2.Research evolution on the topic of FLW management in the circu- lar economy. Q.

The setting of the threshold of nine excludes  the keywords with low frequencies, and thus the network was more  concentrated. These keywords are divided into three clusters covering  three themes:  impact assessment  biorefinery  nutrient recy- cling. Keywords with a high number of occurrences  are  also provided for each cluster .  4.1. Cluster 1: impact assessment (sustainability, LCA, economic  analysis)  A close interlink between the CE and sustainability in the food sector  has been emphasised in many studies. For instance, Jurgilevich et al.   cast light on the integration of the CE concept in the FSC that  contributes to promoting sustainable production and consumption and  FLW management practices. Genovese et al.  illustrate how the CE  pushes the frontiers of sustainability by using a circular FSC (waste  cooking oil for biodiesel production) where materials can be used over  and over again, and the biosphere is not a sink for residuals. Kiss et al.   demonstrated the linkage between the CE and sustainability in  the promotion of short FSCs. Resource exchanges at the local scale  following the industrial symbiosis principle are increasingly emphasised as the interface between the circular economy and sustainability  .  This relationship has been quantitatively measured using LCA and  economic analysis tools, as revealed by the keyword list . These  tools aid the decision-making process to determine optimal FLW pre- vention and management options considering environmental and eco- nomic performance. Detailed analysis of how LCA and economic  analysis have been applied is presented in Section 5.4.3 . It is noted that  the economic analysis keyword appears in 71 articles in the review  sample, but many of these articles are experimental studies taking the  laboratory process efficiency  as an economic indicator.  4.2. Cluster 2: biorefinery   Biorefinery is the cornerstone in the transition from linear to the CE  , which is aligned with the  cascading principle of the CE. The biorefinery process synergises mul- tiple mono-processes to produce multiple output products for multiple  markets, such as food supplements, bioplastics, cosmetics and pharma - ceuticals, and biofuels, contributing to the diversification of product  portfolio and revenue gains (de la Caba et al., 2019 ; Teigiserova et al.,  2019 ).

International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 7sugarcane to replace petroleum-based refinery is not a new topic, the  food versus fuel dilemma has sparked a growing interest in utilising  FLWs as alternative feedstocks over the last few years (Venkata Mohan  et al., 2016 ). However, the technology remains novel, necessitating  further investigation into pre-treatment technologies (hydrolysis or  fermentation) and the process efficiency enhancement (Barampouti  et al., 2019 ).  In this cluster, biorefinery is closely associated with valorisation and  animal feed production. Valorisation refers to the conversion of FLW  into high-value bio-compound and animal feed  while  full valorisation means a cascading biorefinery before energy and soil  restoration options . Valorisation  receives considerable attention in the review sample (i.e. Mirabella  et al., 2014 ; Zabaniotou and Kamaterou, 2019 ) and is normally appli - cable to manage the “homogeneity of the waste flows ” (Corrado and  Sala, 2018 , p. 129) e.g. by-products at the processing plants.  Insect-rearing on plant-based FLW, such as fruits and vegetables, for  feed production is also a type of valorisation ; and this trend marks a shift away from simple thermal food-to-feed conversion  .  4.3. Cluster 3: nutrient recycling   Interest in the stand-alone decentralised technology like Anaerobic  digestion  is prominent in the review sample. AD is a mature  technology, particularly in Europe with many operational plants (Slor- ach et al., 2019b ) to recover energy and recycle nutrient-rich digestates  back to soils .  Additionally, AD can be deployed on a small scale in any geographical  location , which makes it fit well in the industrial  symbiosis and regenerative principle of the CE. It is estimated that if all  bread waste in the UK was fed into AD plants, it could generate roughly  10%  of the total energy used in the bread sector each year  . Compared to incineration and landfill, AD is  proven to be an efficient and eco-friendly  waste treatment  option .  Traditionally, revenue from AD plants comes merely from biogas or  heat/electricity yield while digestate is classified as “waste ”. Following  the regenerative principle of CE, digestate should be utilised as bio-  fertilisers and contribute to return nutrients  to  the biosphere  to improve soil fertility and promote  the growth of maize . Unfortunately, not all countries  recognise the legal status of this bio-fertiliser stream (Fuldauer et al.,  2018 ). Looking at Italy, for instance, the use of digestates from  agro-feedstock is accepted but those from organic Municipal Solid Waste   are banned. Moreover, the statistical analysis study of Beggio  et al.  established that there is no statistically significant differ - ence between digestate generated from agro-feedstock and organic  MSW. There is a call for re-legislation to support the commercialisation  of AD-effluent .  Fig. 5.Keyword co-occurrence analysis.   Table 2  Keywords with high occurrences in each cluster.

International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 85.Structural dimension analysis  In this section, four structural dimensions were statistically and  analytically evaluated to reveal the main research streams in the topic of  FLW prevention and management under the CE perspective. These di- mensions are chosen based on two relevant papers in the CE topic   and one paper in the FLW  management topic . Within this highly fragmented  research area, the reliance on the existing way of analysing literature  offers a useful guideline for our analysis.  5.1. Research methods  The methods of review sample fall into five types  experiment,   modelling,  literature review,  theoretical and conceptual  framework  survey; the first three types of which are the most popular  .  The highest number of papers  used lab-scale or pilot studies to  demonstrate the feasibility of technological innovations to valorise  FLWs or enhance the efficiency of current processes (Bosco et al., 2017 ;  Esteban-Guti ˘errez et al., 2018 ; Grillo et al., 2019 ; Atasoy et al., 2020 ;  Weber et al., 2020 ), or demonstrate the feasibility of self-sustaining FSC  model . Positive results from experiments pave the  way for the upscaling potentials, driving the transition towards the CE.  The experimental method is followed by modelling. Common modelling  tools include LCA-based methods , material flow analysis   , economic analysis ) , optimisation   and simulation . The main purposes of modelling papers are to  assess the techno-economic feasibility and environmental impact of  different FLW prevention and management options and quantify the  flow of the FLW stream. A novel MFA-LCA and agent-based approach to  improving nutrient cycle management in agricultural systems is pro- posed in Fernandez-Mena et al.  . Literature review papers (58  papers) come third with the focus on seven topics that have been pre- sented in the introduction and are condensed in Appendix 1.  A theoretical and conceptual method is adopted in 43 papers. These  studies mainly aim at sustainable consumption models to prevent and  redistribute food waste generation (Mylan et al., 2016 ; Hebrok and  Heidenstr øm, 2019 ). Several behaviour theories are employed: frame  analysis for food donations , the theory of change  for  food sharing , prospect ’s theory for customers ’  perception of biowaste products , convention theory  for retailer ’s role in tackling FLW . Some con- ceptual frameworks are proposed: the six-step framework for nutrient  stock and flow accounting , a seven-step  framework for integrated LCA-LCC methodology (De Menna et al.,  2020 ), a framework for MSW collection and recycling (Woon and Lo,  2016 ).  Finally, the survey is the least employed method  with the  main aim being to investigate  perception of end-users towards  biowaste-based products (Danso et al., 2017 ; Aschemann-Witzel et al.,  2019a , 2019b ; McCarthy et al., 2019 ; Russo et al., 2019 ; Coderoni and  Perito, 2020 )  consumers ’ willingness to participate in the CE pro- gram ;  effectiveness  of FLW collection policies and sorting behaviours (Miliute-Plepiene and  Plepys, 2015 ; Liikanen et al., 2016 ; Andersson and Stage, 2018 );   prevention attitude and behaviours of households , of airline employees   and of restaurant owners (Lang et al.,  2020 ).  5.2. The FLW stream  FLW flows in the review sample are grouped into three types:   surplus  homogeneous flow  heterogeneous flow; the last two FLW  types attract the largest attention . Surplus food represents the  edible food that is fit for human consumption, while the last two groups  remain either natural inedibility or inedibility due to degradation  . This classification comes from the differences  in desirable prevention and management strategies for each stream.  Studies on food surplus are associated with prevention and reuse options  while homogeneous FLW flow is commonly linked to valorisation for  high-value compounds (Oldfield et al., 2016 ; Corrado and Sala, 2018 ;  Teigiserova et al., 2019 ). Heterogeneous flow is most suitable for energy  and nutritional recovery, i.e. via AD and composting. In addition, this  classification contributes to overcoming the ongoing debates in inter- preting inedible versus edible or unavoidable versus avoidable in extant  literature . Relatively equal consideration in the  review sample is accorded to heterogeneous and homogeneous flows,  whereas a much lesser extent is paid to the surplus.  Food surplus mainly occurs at the retail and consumption stages of  the FSC but can arise at manufacturing and agricultural stages due to  overproduction .  Homogeneous flow normally occurs at the food processing stage and  agricultural activities  (Banerjee et al., 2018 ; Egelyng  et al., 2018 ) but it can also be generated in the catering services, such as  in the case of spent coffee grounds   or  used cooking oils in restaurants . This  waste stream is discharged in large quantities with high compositional  homogeneity at specific locations , of- fering abundant and low-cost resources. However, the underlying  challenge with this waste stream comes from seasonality and regional  patterns , which might pose risks for the  year-round operation of the single-feedstock plant (Banerjee et al.,  2018 ). Conversely, the heterogeneous waste stream often stems from  supermarkets and households  and catering services  including restaurants, hotels, hospitals and schools (Strazza et al., 2015 ;  Nizami et al., 2017 ), which might not be suitable for valorisation due to  composition complexity, and should be prioritised for energy conversion  and composting over incineration and landfill. Compared to homoge - neous flow, this waste stream is difficult to quantify in terms of potential  scale and composition . In addition, it encounters  logistical challenges from the collection and transportation process in  geographically dispersed supply sources .  5.3. FLW prevention and management options  Fig. 8 shows the preferences in literature across various FLW pre- vention and management options. Recycling and recovery attract wider  research attention compared to prevention and reuse, which is aligned  with the finding in KCN in Section 4.  5.3.1. Prevention and reuse  As noted in Section 5.2, prevention and reuse are only associated  with surplus flow management. Prevention in the review sample mainly  Fig. 6.Type of research methods employed.    Fig. 7.Types of FLW flows.  Q. Do et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 9targets consumption stages, but other parts of the supply chain are also  discussed. At the household level, FLW generation is primarily derived  from sociopsychological and cultural factors such as social norms,  perception, education level, individual preferences (Todorova et al.,  2018 ; Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2019a , 2019b ). Thus, a number of pa- pers examined how these factors drive FLW generation (e.g. in Mylan  et al., 2016 ; Hebrok and Heidenstr øm, 2019 ; Lehtokunnas et al., 2020 ).  Generic prevention practices that target more sustainable consumption  are proposed, including enhancing food literacy and knowledge in  cooking and planned purchases (Vilari ~no et al., 2017 ; Hebrok and  Heidenstr øm, 2019 ), acceptance of sub-optimal foods, and food safety  perception . A small body of  literature in the review sample investigates the effectiveness of waste  policy and prevention programs in shifting consumers ’ behaviour, such  as sorting policy, awareness campaign, home composting promotion,  leftover consumptions (e.g. in Miliute-Plepiene and Plepys, 2015 ;  Andersson and Stage, 2018 ; Johansson and Corvellec, 2018 ; Zorpas  et al., 2018 ). From upstream of the FSC to retailers, prevention can be  attained by better logistics and more efficient management tools by, for  instance, adequate storage, cold chain management for perishable items,  spoilage prevention packaging, smaller plates at different prices  . In addition, it is suggested that prevention efforts  are prioritised for more resource-intensive products, such as red meat  and dairy products . Retailers and restaurants  can contribute to lowering household food waste generation, e.g. by  standardising data labelling, printing food storage tips on carrier bags,  or revising promotion campaigns for perishable foods (Vilari ~no et al.,  2017 ; Teigiserova et al., 2020 ). Similarly, processing firms can reduce  food wastes by remanufacturing or selling with promotion and discount  . Some studies quantitatively assess the impacts of  prevention in comparison with FLW management methods, such as  reuse, AD, compost and incineration (Albizzati et al., 2019 ; Brancoli  et al., 2020 ). The most extensive list is found in Crist ˘obal et al., 2018a ,  2018b who evaluated twelve prevention measures, seven reuse and  three recycling-recovery practices. The results of these studies supported  prevention and reuse as the most favourable options in term of envi- ronmental performance.  Reuse has gained growing research recognition with a diversity of  sharing models, e.g. harvest sharing, meal sharing and leftover sharing   and numerous other sharing initiatives (Facchini et al.,  2018 ). Although reuse might not automatically translate to FLW  reduction , it enhances social welfare, reduces food  poverty, and alleviates hunger . Based on an analysis of  52 food-sharing platforms, Michelini et al.  proposed a novel way  to divide reuse into: Sharing for charity, Sharing for the communities,  Sharing for money . The review sample paid  equal attention to all three types:   - Sharing for money, also known as pseudo sharing, is primarily in  form of Business to Consumer  allowing retailers and catering  outlets to post unsold foods on social media so consumers can buy.  However, it can also be in Business to Business  form, e.g.  where collectors gather food left-overs from retailers and make value  out of them   - Sharing for charity is in B2B and Customer to Business  forms  where food is collected from all sorts of donors and redistributed to  food banks at local and national scale e.g. food aid activities in  Finland  or donation of retailers (Lee and Tongarlak,  2017 )   - Sharing for community, also known as Peer to Peer  sharing, is  when food is shared amongst consumers, e.g. food sharing in the  campus environment . P2P has  become increasingly popular in practice thanks to the web-based  platform and mobile apps (Harvey et al., 2020 ; Makov et al.,  2020 ). P2P users are commonly found to be in the group with lower  income yet higher education level .  However, the outreach of reuse might encounter the following  challenges: market fragmentation, traceability and responsibility of food  donors, strict safety and hygiene norms (Zurek, 2016 ; Sarti et al., 2017 ;  Tikka, 2019 ), lack of coherent efforts, uncertainty in the estimation of  surplus availability , low participation interests  due to time and effort incurred and psychological barriers (Makov et al.,  2020 ).  5.3.2. Recycle and recovery  A plethora of options are identified to extract and retain the value  from bio-waste, but they are normally grouped into three technological  pathways: thermochemical, physiochemical and biochemical processes  . The thermochemical process such as pyrolysis or  gasification is used to turn biogas into fuels, electricity, and heat.  Physiochemical  converts bio-waste into fuels  and bio-products. Biochemical  aims to turn  bio-waste into energy and fertilisers. These technological options have  been thoroughly reviewed in the literature . Examples are  manifold: valorisation option in Mirabella et al.  ; Teigiserova  et al.  , AD in Capson-Tojo et al.  ; biorefinery models in  Venkata Mohan et al.  ; pyrolysis in Elkhalifa et al.  . The  output of the technological options for processing bio-waste can be  grouped into four categories:  bio-based materials,  animal feed,   energy, and  compost.  As presented in Fig. 8, the conversion of bio-waste to energy and bio-  based materials received the widest attention in the literature, followed  by compost production. The literature is limited on the production of  animal feeds. The main feedstock for bio-based material extraction and  animal feeds are agro-residues, by-products from processing (e.g. fruit  pulp) and vegetable/fruit wastes, which are homogeneous in nature.  Conversely, the main feedstock for energy conversion is from heterog - enous organic MSW flow such as household or restaurant wastes.  Although the CE encourages a cascading use of multiple products across  various industries via valorisation or bio-refinery, the highest interest  remains on food-to-energy conversion, which could be partly attributed  to the policy supports  for energy recovery in diverting  organic waste from landfill .  The opportunities and challenges associated with each type of output  category, are synthesised and summarised in Table 3. These are not  merely influenced by technological feasibility   but also impacted by supply, market, logistics, policy, quantification  issues. The first column in Table 3 lists the four output categories. The  Fig. 8.Types of FLW prevention and management options.  Q.

International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 11assessment of current impacts and future scenarios. Fig. 9 encapsulates  the distribution of studies conducting at least one pillar of sustainability  impact assessment . In general, attention is given predominantly to  environmental impact or economic feasibility assessment or a combi - nation of both. The social assessment is scarcely addressed, and this is  attributed to the absence of reliable data and consistent assessment  metrics .  Sgarbossa and Russo  further argued that the promotion of FLW  circular practices positively contributed to social sustainability. Table 4  summarises a list of commonly used indicators in the review sample. It is  noted that there is a lack of a clear guideline on the use of criter - ia/indicators/metrics in the literature . Zabaniotou   recommended borrowing a list of 24 biorefinery sustainability  indicators for SIA given FLW is utilised as feedstock in biorefinery.  Unfortunately, none of the papers in the review sample adopted this set.  5.4.1. Environmental impact assessment  A large body of literature in the review sample  employed  LCA to conduct environmental impact assessment. LCA is a standardised  methodology in ISO standards  and the Interna - tional Reference Life Cycle Data System  handbook (Chom - khamsri et al., 2011 ) to evaluate potential environmental impacts and  resources used throughout a product ’s life cycle. LCA can be used on its  own or combined with other quantitative tools, e.g. mathematical  modelling , or  agent-based modelling . LCA is also  modified into Life Cycle Protein Assessment  to calculate protein  content in the FSC . A variety of LCA methodologies in  FLW management is reviewed in De Menna et al.  ; (Omolayo  et al., 2021 ).  Different impact categories have been used with the support of LCA  software like SimaPro and Gabi. Several studies in the review sample – e.  g. Laso et al.  ; Santagata et al.  ; Slorach et al. (2019a ;  2019b) ; Schmidt Rivera et al.  ; Slorach et al.  – use all or  almost all of 19 impact categories in ReCiPe mid-point methodology.  The remaining only adopt several impact categories such as global  warming potential , Eutrophication Potential , Acidification  potential   and fossil resource depletion potential   . Several papers merely address the  carbon footprint  of different waste treatment  options (six redistribution and treatment options in Eriksson et al.   , five valorisation and recycling options in Scherhaufer et al.   , composting and AD in a supermarket Marrucci et al.  ).  Although justification is provided for the selection of a subset of in- dicators , variations in the selections might  challenge the cross-comparison or mislead the interpretation of the  results.  Resource usage indicators, including energy and water, are also  measured in several studies using a life cycle approach. Edwards et al.   , for instance, evaluated the energy balance of seven waste  management systems. Further, Hoehn et al.  proposed Energy  Return on Investment – Circular economy index  to quantify the  amount of energy recovered from FLW among three options, AD,  incineration and landfill with energy recovery. Laso, Margallo, Gar- cía-Herrero et al.  combined four indicators: water, energy con- sumption, GWP, and nutritional content indicators to consider three  treatment options  animal feed  incineration  landfilling with  energy recovery. 5.4.2. Economic impact assessment  To evaluate economic impacts, the review sample employed the  following economic indicators: treatment cost, profitability index, NPV,  IRR, payback period. These indicators are assessed using tools, such as  Break-Even Point  analysis , Levelized Cost  of Energy  , and LCC (in  Sakai et al., 2017 ; De Menna et al., 2018 ; Slorach et al., 2019a ). LCC  adopts the life cycling thinking to calculate the cost of a product and  service over its life span and is standardised for specific product cate- gories like petroleum . Compared to LCA, the LCC studies for  FLW management and valorisation routes is still in its infancy with  neither a common methodological approach nor an effective and  transparent categorisation of costs . In addition,  it is desirable to combine LCC with other indicators, such as revenues,  profit, value-added, to reflect larger economic impacts.  5.4.3. Eco-environmental impact assessment  A combined economic and efficiency assessment is also common. For  example, Albizzati et al.  compare environmental and economic  impacts of four options for surplus management at a supermarket:  donation, animal feeds, AD and incineration. Muradin et al.   combined LCA and LCOE indicators to evaluate the environmental and  economic effectiveness of the waste-to-energy process. An integrated  LCC and LCA framework for FLW prevention and management was  proposed in De Menna et al.  , but only Slorach et al.   carried out the LCA-LCC assessment for four options: AD, in-vessel  composting, incineration, and landfill.  5.4.4. Three impact assessment   A handful of studies in the review sample addressed three impacts  simultaneously and the adopted indicators are dissimilar. For instance,  Santos and Magrini  employed waste emission reduction, GHG  savings, potential job creation and feedstock remuneration premium,  whereas Sgarbossa and Russo  measured the energy  self-sufficiency indicator , profitability indicator , employment  possibility indicator. Vaneeckhaute et al.  utilised two economic  indicators , four environment indicators (GWP, EP, AP,  FRDP), and a stakeholders ’ perception inquiry as a social impact factor.  6.Discussion: a synthesis of research streams and research  agenda  The findings from KCN analysis in Section 4 suggested that impact  assessment, biorefinery and nutrient recycling are three underlying  research lines in extant literature. This is supported by a significant  number of articles found on these topics from the structural dimension  analysis . However, the fine-grained analysis in Section 5 also  gave rise to other critical factors of FLW management under the CE  framework. Methodological analysis indicated the important role of the  FLW flows quantification and statistical assessment. Three types of FLW  flows – surplus, homogeneity and heterogeneity – follow different pre- vention and management pathways, but they encounter challenges  arising from the following sources: technologies, supply, quantification,  logistics, market factors, policy. Grounded in the detailed and extensive  analysis, we propose a novel way of classifying the literature in FLW  management under the CE into six research streams:  FLW stream  supply and quantification,  practices and technological aspects,   logistics and supply chain management,  market demand,  SIA,   policy and legislation. This novel classification aims to push further  evolution in this ever-increasing research agenda .  6.1. FLW supply and quantification  The reliable quantification of potential FLW flows is the first and  crucial step in supporting the formation of effective FLW interventions  and policies in all three flows of FLW (Corrado and Sala, 2018 ; Hamelin   Fig. 9.Types of sustainability impact assessments.  Q. Do et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 12et al., 2019 ). This helps to monitor the progress of FLW reduction over  time , estimate the potentials of re-distribution  activities , and identify the important waste  stream with respect to mass in order to evaluate its potential for different  treatment options . This also offers a  solution to overcome the scattered and unstable supply issue of FLW,  especially the residues that bear regional and seasonal patterns (Caruso  et al., 2019 ; Gaglio et al., 2019 ), and alleviate the risk of year-round  operation, i.e. by combining multi-seasonal feedstocks (Vardanega  et al., 2015 ; Banerjee et al., 2018 ). Unfortunately, the unavailability of  FLW data and high variability in accounting methods hinder the reliable  quantification of FLW flows (Corrado et al., 2017 ; Teigiserova et al.,  2019 ). There is a pressing need to improve availability, reliability and  level of detail in the data on the volume of food loss, waste and surplus  generation (Corrado and Sala, 2018 ; Crist ˘obal et al., 2018a , 2018b ;  Facchini et al., 2018 ). A useful recommendation for enhancing the FLW  generation data at the household level is based on consumers ’ diaries,  weighting, and source separation . Similarly,  although some FLW accounting methods, such as MFA (Metson et al.,  2018 ; Amicarelli et al., 2020 ; Stephan et al., 2020 ) or geo-localized  methodology  have been applied, FLW quantifi - cation is in urgent need of a harmonised methodology. Further, as FLW  occurs at all stages of FSC, future work should be conducted at the  supply chain level – such as the case of pasta in Principato et al.  –  to quickly locate the hotspots of FLW generation along the supply chain  and allocate efforts to tackle the problems.  In addition to FLW accounting, it is significant to grasp insights into  the chemical composition and energy content of different FLW types   because they influence the  choice of optimal technologies for bio-based production. However, the  knowledge of FLW chemical composition and energy content is fairly  limited , which opens up an avenue for future  studies to explore.  6.2. Practices and technological aspects of FLW prevention and  management  6.2.1. Prevention and reuse  As analysed in Section 5.3.1 ., prevention practices vary across the  supply chain. Household FLW reduction mainly aims at shifting be- haviours, whereas the upper parts of the FSC focus primarily on better  logistics and more efficient management. There is an increasing interest  in exploring the impact of food packaging on FLW minimisation  , which paves the way for further research,  such as the role of innovative sustainable food packaging solutions in  preserving food quality, prolonging food shelf-life, and reducing FLW  level  or the accounting method for packaging-related FLW . The  promotion of biodegradable packaging in FSC, which is in line with the  pure circle principle of the CE, is also a topic of great interest in this  angle.  As for reuse specified in Section 5.3.1 , the existence of all three  sharing models – sharing for money, sharing for charity, and sharing for  community – is evident in both practice and academics. To unlock their  full potential, the following research agendas are proposed:  -There is a call for further investigation into the enablers and de- terminants of the users ’ engagement in all three food sharing models  , particularly P2P – a pure sharing model  where donor-recipient reciprocity and balance are rare (Harvey  et al., 2020 ). Examples of enablers include the perception and so- cioeconomic status of online sharing donors, volunteers, and re- cipients. Stigma from recipients of food, e.g. feeling embarrassment  or indebtedness, or fear might challenge the collection of data for this  type of research. In addition, the scope of these studies should target  various FSC actors from farmers, processors, retailers, restaurants  and household to non-profit organisations .   - The quantitative examinations of the performance and associated  benefits of different sharing models are desirable. Although Choi  et al.  evaluated the impacts of a sharing for money platform,  authors recommend that future researchers conduct performance  comparison studies for all three types of food sharing models.  6.2.2. Recycle and recovery  When surplus turns to waste, appropriate FLW recycle and recovery  are necessary to retain the FLW value, which is aligned with the  regenerative and cascading principle of CE. As we have been in a  petroleum-based society for many years, biorefinery that integrates  multiple processes needs to be promoted at an industrial scale to effec- tively compete and replace the fossil-fuel industry (Vardanega et al.,  2015 ). However, a significant number of experiments and technological  review papers in the review sample  suggest that FLW-based  biorefinery technologies are mainly at conceptual design,  laboratory-scale, or pilot-scale level. The technical viability and eco- nomic feasibility assessments for the upscale potentials of these inte- grated processes are urgently needed . These  assessments can be aided by computational tools, such as process  modelling and simulation .  Section 4 revealed biorefinery and AD-based technologies as two  dominant research lines in the review sample. Biorefinery is linked to  the valorisation of the homogeneous stream to generate higher-end  products, such as bioactive compounds and animal feed using insect  rearing. AD, on the other hand, is associated with energy and compost  generation using the heterogeneous FLW feedstock.

International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 13biorefinery, AD is a mature technology with high TRL and has been  increasingly deployed in practice. However, operational AD plants using  FLW substrate prevalently adopt mono-processes for biogas production,  which results in the underutilisation of associated resources (Lytras  et al., 2020). Recent research interests have been extended to allow the  production of multiple high-value products along with biogas. Examples  of desirable outputs include biomethane, biohydrogen, lactic acid, suc- cinic acid, volatile fatty acids, bioelectricity – technological details are  available in the review papers of Lytras et al.  and Dahiya et al.  . The technological feasibility and financial feasibility of a  sequential production of lactic acid and biogas from FLW were  confirmed in Barampouti et al. . Further, Section 5.3.2 signalled  the issue of low yield and small capacity as the limitations of the current  waste conversion technologies, not only for unproven technologies like  bio-material extractions but also for the proven technologies like AD. As  such, the investigation into optimising process design to produce mul- tiple high-value output products and enhance yields at commercial scale  level to maximise the economic feasibility continues to be the promising  research avenue for future studies.  6.3. Logistics and supply chain management  Logistics and supply chain management are essential parts of FLW  prevention and management (Barampouti et al., 2019; Weber et al.,  2020). A significant portion of FLW, particularly for perishable items, is  attributed to logistics activities and extensive supply chain networks,  which drives the shift towards a more sustainable production and con- sumption model – a short FSC where foods are produced and consumed  locally . As tackling the FLW issue cannot be achieved  by the voluntary action of a single actor, the commitment of all actors in  the entire FSC, which might involve rethinking the supply chain model  to minimise FLW, such as via promoting short FSC, is essential (Muriana,  2017). Thus, we suggested a new research line devoted to the unveiling  of the performance of short FSC compared to the traditional counterpart taking FLW into consideration. As for reuse, a quantitative examination  of various supply chain management issues, including logistics, supply  contract, operational risks, revenue models , is  advocated to determine the critical factors underpinning the success of  each sharing model . For instance, Choi et al.   established logistics cost as the significant factor justifying the  benefits of the food sharing models.  An effective recycle and recovery of FLW entails the establishment of  extensive logistics networks and supply chain management – from the  collection, transportation to the production process before launching the  output products to the market . When collec - tion and transportation stages are responsible for significant environ - mental impacts, addressing logistics issues associated with these stages,  such as the geographic location of plants, inbound and outbound  transport types and distances, is a crucial point that has been emphas - ised in many papers in review samples (e.g. Nizami et al., 2017; Carillo  et al., 2018; Muradin et al., 2018; Vaneeckhaute et al., 2018; Slorach  et al., 2019b). Future studies could fruitfully pursue the following  research avenues:   - Further innovations in smart collection and transportation systems:  Several innovative collection systems are proposed and evaluated in  the literature: the use of under-the-sink FLW disposal connected to a  sewer system; pipelines for FLW transport instead of trucks (Muradin  et al., 2018); the use of bio-diesel for truck transportation (Santagata  et al., 2017); pre-composter for FLW mass and volume reduction at  the collection point ; drying process to reduce  moisture content allowing longer storage and lower transportation  cost . More studies in this direction are ex- pected to lower the environmental and cost impacts associated with  collection and transportation.   - The shift to decentralised plants: there is a growing interest in  decentralised FLW conversion technologies in the review sample, e.  g. smart bin fermentation system . Although fewer Table 5  Research agenda basing on the taxonomy framework.

Q. Do et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 14plants of bigger size can optimise the economy of scale, its envi- ronmental benefits cannot offset the environmental impact deriving  from longer transport distance. Take AD plant, for instance; it was  proven that the plant can only create a favourable environmental  impact when located within 20 km of the maize cropland (Muradin  et al., 2018 ). An interesting argument put forward by Teigiserova  et al.  indicates that for a FLW-based biorefinery plant, the  economy of scope that relies on cascading production is independent  of scale, which is beneficial to small and medium scale, short-chain  biorefineries. Besides, large biorefinery plants with long transport  distances and a long value chain lead to a reduction in the feedstock  quality and high transport emissions. The rapid deterioration nature  of FLW implies a further loss in nutrient contents. Smaller plants, on  the other hand, reduce the associated transport cost, and alleviate the  pressures on the required infrastructure for sorting, storage, and  transportation  while intensifying the production  process to increase value-added (Banerjee et al., 2018 ; Barampouti  et al., 2019 ). This trend also incentivises the closed-loop model,  which is aligned with the industrial symbiosis principle of the CE; for  instance, a decentralised biogas plant is located in the vicinity of an  agri-food processing plant, from which the FLW feedstock is supplied  to the biogas plant via transmission pipelines while the generated  heat is fed back to the processing plant or its farms (Muradin et al.,  2018 ).  6.4. Market demand for food surplus and bio-based products  This factor is not applicable to prevention but crucial for other op- tions. For reuse, special attention should be paid to deriving a reliable  approximation for the financial value of food surplus circulated in three  sharing models, thereby reflecting better the real value brought about by  these sharing operations (Richards and Hamilton, 2018 ; Harvey et al.,  2020 ). For recycle and recovery, technological feasibility and contin - uous supply assurance are not the only constraints for commercial suc- cess. The market factor should be taken into consideration to expand and  diversify market outlets of bio-based products and attract investors ’  interest (Woon and Lo, 2016 ; Borrello et al., 2017 ; Genovese et al., 2017 ;  Chojnacka et al., 2019 ; Mak et al., 2020 ). Thus, we call for more studies  on two following research avenues:   - To further investigate customers ’ perception and interest towards  FLW-based products. When the market price of bio-based products is  found to be higher than the fossil-based alternatives such as in cases  of bioplastics  and  biofertilizers , drivers for purchasing  bio-based products stem directly from attitude and indirectly from  green self-identity. Thus, insights into consumers ’ attitudes and how  those attitudes might be influenced provide useful information to  producers and consumers beyond the basic idea of how FLW can  potentially be recovered for reuse .  -To explore the generic market condition factors, i.e. market satura - tion and market power, of the output products. This is because the  market price of bio-based products is strongly linked to the global  supply and demand of both bio- and fossil-based products (Teigi - serova et al., 2019 ). Undoubtedly, the more expensive the products  become the higher the incentives to tap into the cheaper alternatives,  e.g. low-cost food waste resources. Moreover, such incentives also  depend on market power. Take the fertiliser market as a salient  example. As demand for fertiliser always exceeds supply, fertiliser  producers who possess strong market power are less likely, without  an explicit support regime, to alter their hundred-year fossil-based  production technology .   - The nutritional value and safety analysis entail further attention to  enhance the understanding of end-users about the potential benefits  and impacts . This should be supported by scientific evidence, especially for nutraceu - tical products where their effectiveness might not be clear.  6.5. Sustainability impact assessment  Section 5.4 revealed that the selection of optimal FLW prevention  and management options requires a detailed economic, environmental,  and social assessment. Meanwhile, there is a growing interest in the  adoption of a life cycling approach to aid such a decision (Ingrao et al.,  2018 ; Laso et al., 2018; Omolayo et al., 2021 ) because it fosters the  development of a coherent modelling and a systematic analytical  framework of FLW prevention and management .  Four future research avenues are identified in this section:  -We call for the development of a list of friendly integrated sustain - ability impact indicators allowing a balance between  environmentally-friendly goals, economic returns, and social bene- fits in future FLW prevention and management research. This need is  also underscored in a number of papers (e.g. Zabaniotou, 2018 ;  Omolayo et al., 2021 ). Much attention is given to environmental and  economic assessments, while the inclusion of social aspects is rare  and mainly constrained to job creation , which  demands further consideration. A list of social indicators proposed  by Kooduvalli et al.  ; Ioannidou et al.  can be employed.  Additionally, an integrated LCA, LCC and social life assessment   for triple-bottom-line assessment opens up interesting  research avenues for future studies .  Further, we recommend that SIA indicators are tailored for specific  target products, e.g. creation of biogas-specific technical standards  for biogas-derived energy . Moreover, the  incorporation of a nutritional value in SIA also leaves a promising  avenue of research in the future (i.e. in Ingrao et al., 2018 ; Laso et al.,  2018).   - Since laws and policies regarding FLW vary across spatial context  and best practices are influenced by seasons and locations, there is a  need for developing spatial and temporal SIA studies in different  areas and socio-economic contexts at different periods to enhance  data transparency, facilitate cross-comparison and support spatially  and temporally targeted FLW polices .  -A dearth of studies incorporates prevention and reuse (the top pri- orities in the waste hierarchy) in SIA. This is partly attributed to the  methodical difficulties in acquiring reliable data concerning FLW  prevention actions . Due to the  context-laden characteristics of FLW issues, the waste hierarchy  should only be seen as a rough generalisation (Eriksson and Spång - berg, 2017 ). Donation might not always be as strictly environmen - tally efficient as AD or incineration . An SIA  applicable to all levels of the waste hierarchy is desirable to inform  decision-making, and in the long term, promote the design of sus- tainable and cost-efficient interventions and more resource-efficient  FSC . Further, it is unlikely that a  single option in the waste hierarchy is sufficient to tackle the FLW  problem. For instance, although reuse is favourable, food hygiene or  biosecurity decreases the likelihood of reuse for the entire FLW  stream; thus, a flexible combination of prevention, reuse, recycling  and recovery tailored for the local infrastructure is highly recom - mended .   - Similarly, SIA should also be carried out to assess the comparative  impacts of the production of the FLW-based products versus fossil-  based counterparts ; and of FLW-based  products versus first-generation biomass-based alternatives (Mak  et al., 2020 ). This is to avoid the suboptimal designs of FLW-based  biorefineries with almost the same environmental burdens as the  petrochemical systems . Q. Do et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        International Journal of Production Economics 239  108209 156.6. Policy and legislation  Policy and legislation are widely acclaimed for their instrumental  role in shaping national FLW prevention and management directions.  For instance, the UK policies incentivise FLW prevention and conversion  to energy and compost, while surplus food redistribution has not gained  equal interest . Combined with the highly frag- mented and independent redistribution efforts, the outreach of food  redistribution initiatives in the UK is therefore limited. The provision of  government incentives is important to develop a larger and coherent  redistribution system at all stages of the FSC  and  to make the best use of sharing models for the entire FSC .  For prevention, the government can shift the FSC actors’ awareness and  behaviour towards more sustainable production and consumption  models via educational programs, FLW monitoring and FLW separation  policy at the household level. Although the effectiveness of these cam- paigns has been analysed in several studies (Jereme et al., 2018;  Johansson and Corvellec, 2018; Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2019a,  2019b), these studies are confined to a specific context-setting. Similar  studies could be replicated in different countries to support policy - making progress. The organisation and efficiency of short FSC can also  be fundamentally affected by governmental support or regulatory pol- icies .  For reuse and recycle, policy and legislation can progress and hinder  these FLW activities. As a driver, law and regulations influence the  development of specific FLW management routes via penalty and  reward instruments, such as subsidy, tax relief, biofuel obligation or  disposal fee . A  ban on surplus disposal at supermarkets, such as in France, promotes  donations efforts (Lee and Tongarlak, 2017; Richards and Hamilton,  2018; Harvey et al., 2020). In addition, strong legislative support can  educate consumers to recognise the benefits of bio-based product con- sumption which increases public acceptance and induces behavioural  change. This contributes to ensuring the market demand for FLW-based  products. Conversely, conflicting and unharmonised policies might  constrain engagement in FLW management. The unclear legal status of  digestate, as analysed in Section 4.3, is a stark example. Besides, legal  restrictions might eliminate the potential for full-scale implementation  of the valorisation options , such as the EU stringent  regulation on the reuse of foods as animal feeds and bans on the use of  animal by-products as feeds . Thus,  re-legislation should be considered to help farmers to cut cost, save land  use and environmental impacts. Further, a lack of a long-term support  regime by the government prevents the diffusion of innovative techno - logical initiatives .  It is noted that as FLW-related policy support and legal regimes vary  from country to country , cross-country com- parison offers interesting insights and useful lessons to be learnt. For  instance, Teigiserova et al.  underlined the variations in the food  surplus reuse strategies of the EU member countries: Italy encourages  food donation in the whole FSC; Denmark, Belgium, France only target  the retail level; Germany, Portugal, and Hungary stimulate food dona- tion via tax deduction. Giordano et al.  compared Italian and  French laws regarding FLW hierarchy and uncovered that Italian law  puts more effort into prevention by raising awareness campaigns while  French laws focus mostly on the actions of supermarkets. De Clercq et al.  , who compared the legal framework of seven countries for  FLW-based AD technology, associated the rapid proliferation of AD  plants in China with its centralised policy setting, and recommended  that China adopt consumption-linked subsidy schemes as in Germany  and Sweden to tie the payments to the amount of biogas consumed  rather than the amount produced to avoid biogas being dumped at low  price. The paper also underlined the role of the policies in the UK and  France in incentivising the production of multiple outputs – such as electricity, heat, and bio-fertiliser – from AD plants in order to ensure  revenue stability for plant operators.  7.Conclusion and limitations  7.1. Conclusion  In this study, a novel taxonomy is proposed to synthesise and classify  the exhaustive and highly fragmented FLW literature under the CE  landscape into six streams of research:  FLW sourcing and quantifi - cation,  practices and technological aspects,  logistics and supply  chain management  market factor  sustainability impact assess - ment  policy and legislation. The taxonomy allows us to accentuate  current research lines and paves the way for future research directions  . While the spotlights in the academic agenda are currently on  the second and fifth factors: FLW prevention practices and conversion  technologies and LCA-based SIA, more consideration needs to be given  to the remaining factors.  We believe that this study offers fruitful suggestions for scholars at  the crossroads of two domains, the CE and FLW management. First, our  taxonomy urges comprehensive approaches towards an integrated FLW  prevention and management framework for gaining the overall benefits,  beyond technological feasibility. Extensive research agendas can direct  future researchers towards the achievement of such a holistic approach  while avoiding stagnant and saturated research areas. Second, a thor- ough discussion of how the CE principles are translated into FLW pre- vention and management offers an insight into the underlying features  of the FLW under the CE that goes beyond the waste hierarchy. Although  this study is primarily oriented towards an academic audience, it has  clear implications for policymakers and decision-makers. The taxonomy  offers a useful guideline for managers and policymakers in structuring  their strategies and actions for effective FLW prevention and manage - ment at both national and supply chain levels. Managers are encouraged  to quantify FLW-related problems and explore a range of potential op- tions to tackle them. These options should be quantitatively assessed to  apprehend possible trade-offs considering six research streams in the  taxonomy framework simultaneously. Policymakers play an instru - mental role in keeping these options open to managers via effective  incentive schemes. Meanwhile, conflicts and ambiguity in laws and  regulations should be solved on the basis of scientific evidence.  7.2. Limitations  Finally, it is important to point out certain limitations of the paper.  The first limitation comes from our search restriction to two databases –  Scopus and Web of Science – which might exclude relevant papers that  have not been listed in one of these databases. However, we believe that  the rigour of the entire SLR process, which covers and reflects the  extensive body of knowledge, offers a fairly comprehensive and sys- tematic picture of the research topic, and thus, the credibility of research  results is ensured. In addition, the breadth of the study may come at the  cost of the depth of the analysis. We have used a reasonable mix of  keywords on two large topics – FLW and CE – that yield a significant  number of papers without constraint to a particular research domain.  Although relevant references are provided in each section to guide  future researchers and alleviate the depth limitation, we call for more  collaborative research among researchers from diversified fields, such as  supply chain management and operation management, to deepen the  understanding of the role of each factor in our framework.
