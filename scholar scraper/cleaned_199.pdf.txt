foodenergywater FEW nexus captures the interconnec tions and codependencies of the three systems and it has been proposed that policy makers should use a nexus approach to help progress the UNs sustainable development goals Boas et al A framework for dening this threepillar nexus proposed byHoff focuses on achieving climate protection and secur ing fair access to water food and energy for all while encouraging the sustainable growth of a green economy in a rapidly urbanising world Flammini et al provide broad context and conceptu alisation of the nexus and use case studies to present an assess ment tool for the quantitative analysis of the FEW nexus The tool includes a set of potential indicators that could be chosen by policy makers in consultation with stakeholders The Global Water Partnership was an early adopter of the nexus principle with itsIntegrated Water Partnership Management concept but with a watercentric view it has been criticised for not addressing energy food and land aspects equally Ringler et al Similarly the WaterEnergyFood Nexus Tool developed by the Qatar Envi ronment and Energy Research Institute aims to address all nexus impacts but its focus is primarily on food security Daher and Mohtar a criticism also made of its previous version Smajgl et al While these early models have drawn some criticism they have helped to progress the nexus concept How ever the concept is yet to have a universally agreed denition or purpose as highlighted by two recent review papers Endo et al Zhang et al All nexus approaches require a comprehensive understanding of the system being analysed to identify the resources being used and their impacts on the nexus Life cycle assessment LCA is a wellestablished technique which considers all the inputs and outputs of a product or process to assess its environmental impacts ISO a ISO b LCA has been identied as an important tool for the nexus McGrane et al and has been used  X C The Authors Published

ScienceDirect Waste Management journal homepage wwwelse viercomloc atewasman previously to assess the impact on the foodenergywater FEW nexus of different products and processes Some examples include breakfast cereals Jeswani et al biomass gasication Al Ansari et al and biogas from energy crops Pacetti et al Karabulut et al have expanded the FEW nexus to include land and ecosystem in relation to food security proposing a matrix for identifying hotspots in each nexus area LCA is used to determine the impact of different energy land and water uses related to food production These resources are ranked individually from negative to positive for their effect on different ecosystem provisions While this is a useful visual tool for qualitative hotspot analysis within the nexus it is lacking an overall quantitative impact on the nexus Several LCA studies have also focused on food waste in the con text of the FEW nexus For instance Kibler et al have pro posed a high level conceptual model for assessing the impacts of the food supply chain and waste on the nexus The authors con clude that there is a need for a quantitative assessment of food waste management within a nexus framework Wang et al have also considered a nexus approach to urban waste management but focusing mainly on monetary costs and carbon emissions Laso et al have expanded the FEW nexus to include a cli mate change component and assess waste management in the anchovy canning industry in comparison with landlling incinera tion and valorisation of the waste as sh feed sea bass One indi cator is used to assess each nexus aspect water consumption for water global warming potential for climate change energy con sumption for energy and the amount of protein in waste for the food aspect This approach captures the impacts on water climate change and energy but the food aspect indicator is very specic to the studied system and would be difcult to apply to other sys tems Furthermore each of these studies has developed a nexus model specic to the systems being considered making it difcultto draw wider comparisons of their impact on the nexus As far as the authors are aware no previous studies have attempted to incorporate human health into a nexus assessment despite its importance for human wellbeing and quality of life The World Health Organization WHO estimate that one in nine deaths are attributable to health conditions related to air pollution with approximately three million deaths C of global annual deaths solely attributable to ambient air pollution A fur ther million lives are lost annually through exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment that the WHO a deem pre ventable through better management and reduction in chemicals use Therefore this paper presents a new methodology which inte grates for the rst time the health aspect within the foodwater energy FEW nexus to determine the life cycle environmentalimpacts of products technologies or human activities on each of the four aspects of the nexus as well as on the overall nexus The novel aspects of the methodology include its underpinning by life cycle thinking whereby LCA impacts are assigned to different nexus aspects depending on their relevance to either food energy water or health Another novel feature is the method for quantify ing the overall impact on the nexus and its representation in a nexus quadrilateral and pairwise nexus triangles to enable more structured and transparent interpretation of the results The methodology is generic and can be applied to different sys tems Here its application is demonstrated by considering the impacts on the nexus of recovering resources from food waste within the context of a circular economy This illustrative example has been chosen due to the importance of food waste for food water energy and human health and a lack of quantitative studies on its impacts on the whole nexus A circular economy context is considered due to the increasing pressures for its implementation in the European Union EC and the need to understand bet ter if circular necessarily means environmentally sustainable Methods This section rst outlines the proposed foodenergywater health FEWH nexus methodology followed by the rationale for assigning different LCA impacts to each nexus aspect in section The validation of the method through comparison with multicriteria decision analysis is discussed in Section Finally the case study used to illustrate the methodology is detailed in Section The nexus methodology The LCA impacts assigned to different nexus aspects are rst normalised and then aggregated to determine the score for each aspect To help visualise the overall impact on the nexus the aspect scores are plotted on a foursided polygon with each side repre senting one of the nexus aspects this is termed here the nexusquadrilateral The latter is illustrated by a hypothetical example inFig The overall nexus impact is then determined by consider ing all pairwise interconnections six in total between the four nexus aspects and summing up the area covered by the formed pairwise triangles as also illustrated in Fig This is explained in more detail below The environmental impacts are normalised for each aspect and option being evaluated as follows EI naEInaE I min na EImax naE I min na whereNomenclature AD Anaerobic digestion ALO

in Fig If more than one option is evaluated the nexus quadrilateral can be used to rank them visually in a qualitative way This is followed by the quantication of their total impact on the nexus by consid ering pairwise interconnections among all four aspects ie food and energy food and water food and health energy and water energy and health and water and health For this purpose the scores for each pair of the nexus aspects are plotted on six graphs to form pairwise triangles as illustrated in Fig The area of each triangle represents the impact on the two aspects forming that tri angle The total impact on the FEWH nexus is then determined as the sum of the areas of the six triangles EInexussFsE sFsW sFsH sEsW sEsH sWsH CC wheresFsEsW sHscores for the food energy water and healthaspects

example in Fig the aspect scores pre sented in the nexus quadrilateral are assumed to be s F sE s W and s H Plotting these in the six pair wise graphs and using Eq yields the total area of which then represents the total impact on the nexus The following section describes the LCA impact categories con sidered and how they are assigned to each of the four nexus aspects Assigning environmental impacts to the nexus aspects In this study the ReCiPe V method Goedkoop et al is used to estimate the life cycle environmental impacts in the FEWH nexus A total of impacts are considered by this methodHowever fossil depletion is not included in the nexus analysis to avoid double counting as primary energy demand PED is consid ered instead the latter is estimated according to the Thinkstep method included in the GaBi LCA software Ionising radia tion is also omitted as this impact is only directly relevant to nuclear electricity systems Thus for the purposes of the illustra tion of the nexus methodology which considers different options for food waste treatment IR is not relevant However it can be con sidered within the health aspect if deemed directly relevant to the system studied Therefore a total of impacts are considered as detailed in Table Out of these in the base case six impacts are assigned to the food aspect one to the energy ve to the water and four to the health Metal depletion MD is not included in the base case as it is not specically attributable to any of the four aspects but it is considered as part of a sensitivity analysis The latter examines the effect of different allocations of the impacts to the nexus aspects through three scenarios dened in Table As can be seen Fig Illustration of the foodenergywaterhealth nexus in a quadrilateral left and pairwise interactions in the nexus right Left The broken li ne in the nexus quadrilateral illustrates the impact on all four aspects of the nexus simultaneously Right Hatched triangles represent impacts on two aspects of t he nexus at a time showing the pairwise interactions The sum of the hatched triangle areas represents the total impact on the nexus The larger the total area the higher the ov erall impactPC Slorach et al Waste Management in Scenarios and marine impacts are allocated to the food rather than the water aspect as marine water quality arguablyhas a greater impact on seafood stocks than the availability of potable water Scenarios and assign global warming potential GWP to the health aspect to reect its impact on humans Food aspect The ve impacts assigned to the food aspect in the base case are agricultural land occupation ALO urban land occupation ULO natural land transformation NLT terrestrial ecotoxicity TET terrestrial acidication TA and GWP ALO indicates how much land is needed for the cultivation of crops or rearing of ani mals much of which is used to supply food NLT and ULO impact upon the health of ecosystems as habitat loss is a driver for the loss of biodiversity especially relevant for food production as pollinat ing insect populations are in sharp decline SnchezBayo and Wyckhuys Therefore the importance of biodiversity for resilient and sustainable food agriculture is being increasinglyrecognised Crenna et al FAO TET also affects the health of ecosystems by releasing toxic compounds to industrial soil that can harm livestock soil organ isms and reduce biodiversity Soil acidication arises from the emissions of compounds that contribute to TA Each crop has a crit ical soil pH below which bioavailability of nutrients is restricted which limits plant growth the acidity can also increase the con centration of aluminium in soil to a level toxic to plants Goulding GWP is expected to affect food production through rising tem peratures and extreme weather events For example while increased temperatures and rising CO concentrations may improve agricultural yields in high latitudes global production of wheat maize soybean and rice are all projected to fall with a rise in temperature HoeghGuldberg et al Extreme weather events such as droughts and ooding will increase stresses on crops and on livestock IPCC There is also a high risk to mid and lowlatitude sheries and sh stocks with temperaturesincreasing by CC this includes the acidication of the oceans HoeghGuldberg et al In addition to the base case GWP is also assigned to the food aspect in Scenario while in the remaining two scenarios it is assigned to the health aspect as dis cussed in Section Energy The only impact directly relevant to the energy aspect is PED and so it is assigned to this aspect in the base case and all the three scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis In addition to PED MD is considered in Scenario for this aspect to reect the fact that the energy sector and particularly many renewable electricity technologies are reliant on common and rare metals Fizaine and Court Water The impacts that affect aquatic ecosystems are assigned to the water aspect of the nexus Water depletion WD quanties the amount of water used in the life cycle of the system of interest and is a simple measure of the impact on the security of water sup ply The runoff of nutrients into waterways and the resulting freshwater eutrophication FE lead to increased growth of auto trophic species which block the sunlight and deplete dissolved oxygen this ultimately leads to a reduction in aquatic biodiversity Similarly freshwater ecotoxicity FET poses a risk to the whole ecosystem but can also affect directly the supply of potable water for human consumption There are analogous impacts for the marine environment through marine eutrophication ME and marine ecotoxicity MET Therefore these are also assigned to the water nexus aspect in the base case However as mentioned earlier they are consid ered as part of the food aspect in Scenarios Human health The impacts that can affect human health are human toxicity HT particulate matter formation PMF photochemical oxidantTable Life cycle impacts considered in the study and their allocation to different nexus aspects The LCA impacts of different food waste treatment

causing impaired infant lung development Kim et al POF or summer smog and particularly tropospheric ozone has also been shown to reduce lung function exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma and cause long term tissue damage Amann Finally OD increases the level of solar UVB radia tion on the earth which has the potential to increase the inci dences of skin cancers genetic damage and macular degeneration increased UVB radiation also has the benet of increasing vitamin D levels in humans Norval et al Therefore these impacts have been assigned to the health aspect in the base case and all other scenarios Table In addi tion GWP is assigned to this aspect in Scenarios and This is due to climate change endangering human health through the increased occurrence of extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts and hurricanes and by changing the distribution of allergens and infectious diseases Franchini and Mannucci The nexus methodology and multicriteria decision analysis An alternative method for estimating the total environmental impact within the FEWH nexus would be to use one of the multicriteria decision analysis MCDA methods instead To explore how the proposed nexus method compares to MCDA and whether the results of the illustrative case study differ between the two multiattribute value theory Azapagic and Perdan b has been used in this study As an illustration only the base case is considered with the same allocation of the impacts in the MCDA as in the nexus methodology this is illustrated in the deci sion tree in Fig The scores for the four aspects are weighted and summed up to determine an overall nexus impact as followsEInexusXA asa In this case the nexus impact can range from the lowest to highest Note that in congruence with the nexus methodology all the aspects are assumed to have equal importance The aspect scores are estimated according to saXN nwnEI na where the normalised LCA impact EI naallocated to aspect ais esti mated using Eq Illustrative case study recovery of resources from food waste To illustrate the nexus methodology the case study considers the life cycle environmental impact on the FEWH nexus of four options for food waste management used widely in the European Union Manfredi and Pant each of which recovers energy andor material resources anaerobic digestion AD invessel composting IVC incineration and landlling The functional unit is dened as the treatment of tonne of household food waste and the system boundaries are given in Fig The study is based in the UK A brief description of the waste treatment methods is given below for the original LCA results and further details see Slorach et al Anaerobic digestion AD of food waste takes place at a commer cial facility with an annual capacity of tyr The produced biogas is burned onsite in a combined heat and power engine with the excess electricity exported to the grid for which the system is credited The digestate is used in agriculture with the credits for displacing an equivalent amount of mineral fertiliser Invessel composting A rotating drum is used to manage the composting of food waste at a tyr facility The facility hasa controlled atmosphere with scrubbers to limit air emissions and odours The waste is retained in the drums for four days before being matured in open air windrows The compost is applied in agriculture and the system is credited for displacing mineral fertilisers Incineration The incineration process takes place in a large scale facility tyr using a moving grate furnace where the food waste is embedded in general municipal solid waste The heat in combustion gases is used to produce steam which drives a turbine to generate electricity the process is credited for displacing the grid electricity The ue gases are treated before release to the atmosphere including removal of y ash which is sent to landll together with bottom ashes Landlling A modern sanitary landll is considered with a con tained system to capture landll gas capture rate and collect leachate for wastewater treatment A gas engine is used to gener ate electricity from the gas for exporting to the grid the system is credited for displacing the equivalent grid electricity The LCA impacts of these options were estimated previously by Slorach et al using the ReCiPe V methodology These are summarised in Table together with their allocations to the different nexus aspects as discussed in Section Results and discussion Overall impact on the nexus The impacts on the nexus of the four food waste treatment options estimated using Eqs are illustrated in the nexus quadrilaterals in Fig for the base case and Scenarios with the total nexus impacts summarised in Table S in the Supplemen tary Information SI For the full details of the estimations see Table S and Figures SS in the SI In all the cases it is assumedFig MCDA decision tree for the four aspects of the FEWH nexus The allocation of the impacts to the different nexus aspects is the same as in the base case for the nexus methodology see Table The values in brackets represent the weights assumed for the aspects and the impacts based on equal importance of each Forthe impacts acronyms see NomenclaturePC Slorach et al Waste Management that all the impacts and nexus aspects have equal importance with the weights for each provided in Fig As can be seen from Fig and in Table S AD has the lowest nexus impact of in the base case Considering the individual nexus aspects it also has the lowest impact on energy water and health predominantly due to displacing the largest amount of electricity and requiring fewer resources for operation Incinera tion is the next best option but with the overall nexus impact times higher than for AD It has a slightly higher impacton the food aspect than AD and the second highest on the health aspect close to that of landlling The impact of incineration on health is due to the air pollution POF and PMF caused by the ue gas emissions Landlling has the highest impact on water and a total nexus impact of which is times greater than that of AD One of the key inuencing factors is the leachate management which has a high contribution to marine eutrophication IVC is the worst option overall with the nexus impact almost double that of landll It also has the greatest impact on the food energyFig Food waste treatment options and the system boundaries considered in the case study adapted from Slorach et al Fig Impact of the food waste treatment options on the foodenergywaterhealth nexus for the base case and Scenarios assuming equal importance of al l nexus aspects and the impacts PC Slorach et al Waste Management and health aspects Therefore these results show that circularity does not necessarily lead to environmental sustainability particu larly as IVC is favoured over incineration and landlling within a circular economy context EMF When ME and MET are assigned to the food aspect in Scenario there is limited change to the nexus impacts and no change in the ranking of the treatment options Table S in the SI In this case the AD impact goes down by from to due to two reasons the food aspect has the greatest inuence on the AD nexus impact and AD has the lowest MET The scores of all other options increase only slightly A similar trend is found for Scenario where GWP is assigned to health instead of food However a slightly different trend can be noticed for Scenario where MD is assigned to the energy aspect The greatest change in the nexus impacts is for incineration which increases by on thebase case This is related to the construction and operation of the incineration plant which requires more material resources and hence has a higher MD than the other treatment options Owing to its lower MD IVC sees its nexus impact drop to from in the base case Therefore these ndings demonstrate that the results obtained through the proposed nexus methodology are robust with respect to the allocation of impacts to different nexus aspects with no change in the ranking of the options considered However this may not be the case for other systems and the sensitivity to the allocation of impacts should be explored Nexus interconnections This section discusses the pairwise interconnections between the four nexus aspects to demonstrate further the nexus method ology and illustrate how the quantitative results see Figs A A can be combined with qualitative analyses Foodenergy interconnections AD and incineration are both net producers of energy through exporting electricity to the grid However when considering use of this energy for food production the contribution would be rela tively small for AD and for incineration This is based on the PED for food production in the EU of GJt of food Monforti Ferrario et al and the PED values for AD and incineration of and GJt of food waste respectively Slorach et al Although utilising food waste as a renewable energy source is recommended within a circular economy Ellen MacArthur Foundation this is energetically much less efcient than waste prevention Foodwater interconnections AD digestate can contain approximately water Rigby and Smith When applied to the soil this water is used to grow crops but it does not form a signicant fraction of water used in agriculture and much of the water is added during treatment However the application of both the AD digestate and IVC compost are associated with ammonia volatilisation and nitrate runoff which results in ME However the runoff and treatment of lea chate from landlls lead to ten times greater ME than that of AD and therefore poses a greater threat to the health and biodiversity of coastal regions Incineration has very low ME but is the greatest contributor to FE due to the leaching of phosphorus from the y ash DEFRA FE has a direct impact on the quality of water available for crop irrigation and drinking This is particularly rele vant in developing countries where removing nutrients from water has a high cost Reddy et al Both FE and ME are mainly related to the electricity used andor credited across the treatments Foodhealth interconnections Compost and digestate are generally considered benecial for soil quality as they supply key plant nutrients and avoid the use of synthetic fertilisers This can improve the sustainability of food supply and reduce the intensive production of fertilisers which can be harmful to human health Sutton et al It has been sug gested that the longterm use of compost can sequester carbon in soils Favoino and Hogg which could help abate carbon dioxide emissions However the longterm use of digestate derived from livestock slurry has been linked to an accumulation of metals in the soil which could be detrimental to plant growth Nkoa On the other hand foodderived digestate has generally been shown to have signicantly lower levels of heavy metals Rigby and Smith The maturation of compost and the application of digestate result in ammonia volatilisation to the air Ammonia binds with other pollutants to form ne particulate matter which increases mortality rates WHO b Furthermore despite ue gas treat ment incineration still releases some nitrogen oxides and non methane volatile organic compounds to the air This results in incineration having the highest potential to cause summer smog through POF which can trigger asthma reduce lung function and cause lung diseases WHO b Energywater interconnections The main inuence of the waste treatment options on water use is associated with the grid electricity displaced Therefore AD has the lowest water depletion as it generates the highest amount of electricity None of the routes is a signicant primary user of water Energyhealth interconnections Electricity used in IVC and emissions from landlling are the main contributors to human toxicity and related impacts on human health Both AD and incineration have a netnegative HT thus avoiding the related impacts on health by displacing the equivalent amount of grid electricity Waterhealth interconnections As discussed in Section eutrophication impacts on the quality of freshwater and the necessity for treatment Likewise FET and MET affect the biodiversity of aquatic life and potentially water supply security depending on the water treatment infras tructure None of the waste treatment routes has a signicant direct contribution to FET or MET and the impacts are again driven by electricity Sensitivity analysis Weighting of impacts The above results are predicated on equal weighting of impacts and could change if the importance of some impacts was greater than of others This section explores if the outcomes of the study change with the weighting of impacts Two cases are evaluated the rst considers grouping of similar impacts and then weighting them equally and the second explores the change in the impor tance of individual impacts needed to incur a change in the ranking of options Weighting groups of similar impacts Weighted groupings avoid implicit bias if there are two or more similar impacts For example ALO ULO and NLT all represent a form of land use change and weighting each separately effectively assigns a greater weight to land use as in the base case To address this while still assuming equal weighting of all impacts each of the three impacts is assigned the weight of This means that land use as a whole has a weighting of A similar approach is used for the impacts related to terrestrial marinePC Slorach et al Waste Management and freshwater environments as shown in Table Therefore no impact is given priority within each nexus aspect For example in the water aspect the two freshwater impacts FET and FE have a total weighting of as do the two marine impacts MET and ME alongside water depletion which is also weighted at As indicated in Fig the groupweighting has a negligible effect on the nexus impacts of the treatment options with mar ginal deviation from the base case Nevertheless group weighting is recommended when applying the nexus methodology to avoid potential implicit bias towards some impacts Change in weighting needed to change the ranking of options Table S in the SI presents the change in importance and the related weighting of each impact needed to change the ranking of options in different nexus aspects relative to the base case The greatest increase in importance is needed for ME times and POF seven times This changes the ranking of incineration in the water and health aspects respectively Therefore quite sig nicant changes in the importance and weighting are needed despite incineration having the lowest impact for ME and the high est for POF The relative change in the importance of the rest of impacts needed to change the ranking of options ranges between TET and four times GWP and PMF For example increasing the importance of PMF fourfold results in both landlling and incineration having a lower impact on the health aspect than AD This is due to the high PMF of AD For similar reasons doubling the importance of TA leads to a higher impact of AD on the food aspect than of incineration The only impact for which the impor tance has to be decreased to change the ranking of options is TET However none of the changes in the importance of the impacts shown in Table S has any signicant effect on the total nexus impacts and the overall ranking of the options remains the same as in the base case Comparison of the nexus methodology and MCDA The results of the MCDA estimated by Eq and are sum marised in Fig for the base case and Scenarios As in the nexus methodology all impacts and aspects are assumed to have equal importance using the weights in Fig Although the total nexus impacts are different between the nexus methodology and the MCDA the ranking of the options remains the same for all the cases considered However there are some differences in the relative distances between the options For example the nexus impact of IVC is times higher than that of AD while the equivalent difference in MCDA is times In gen eral there is consistently a lower relative difference between the treatment options in MCDA compared to the nexus methodology but this does not affect their overall ranking The weighting applied to the individual aspects could poten tially change the overall sustainability rankings However as indi cated in Table S in the SI the ranking of the options in the foodenergy and health aspects matches that of the overall ranking so changing the weighting would not lead to a change in ranking of the treatment options The only change is found if the importance of the water aspect is increased by a factor of In that case land lling overtakes IVC as the third best option but this weighting effectively eliminates the effects of the other aspects Therefore these results demonstrate that the outcomes obtained through the proposed nexus methodology are in good agreement with the MCDA outcomes for this particular case study Although this serves to validate the methodology it is also possible that the outcomes between the two could be quite different for other systems Further exploration of this is recommended for future work Limitations and application of the nexus methodology The proposed nexus methodology provides a framework in which the environmental impacts of different systems can be interpreted within a FEWH nexus It can therefore guide assess ments and comparisons of products technologies and human activities in a more structured and systematic way However the methodology has several limitations First as it is underpinned by LCA it is reliant on the availability of LCA studies of the systems of interest It also requires estimates on a number of LCA impacts to cover all four nexus aspects Therefore this method should be seen as an extension of LCA rather than standalone Furthermore some impacts are crosscutting and are difcult to assign to one aspect This limitation can be addressed through a Table Grouping and weighting of similar impacts Impact

dTerrestrial impacts eLandrelated impactsFig The effect on the nexus impacts of grouping and weighting similar impacts The solid lines refer to the base case and the broken lines to the groupweighting PC Slorach et al Waste Management sensitivity analysis as demonstrated in this work Another limita tion is that the estimation requires subjective grouping and weightings of LCA impacts This is also the limitation of the valua tion stage in LCA as well as MCDA and can be dealt with through sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of different weights on the outcomes of the analysis A further limitation of the proposed methodology is that all four aspects are considered to have the same importance while in MCDA for example it is possible to change the aspects weights However the methodology allows for different weighting of the impacts within each aspect These could be obtained by eliciting preferences of relevant stakeholders Azapagic and Perdan a or applying a range of objective weighting functions OECDJRC The example in this paper is limited to LCA impacts and thus environmental sustainability The methodology can be broadened to consider economic and social sustainability by including related indicators Quantitative indicators can be normalised and included within the appropriate nexus aspect alongside LCA impacts Qual itative issues could either be converted into quantitative measures using an appropriate technique as commonly done in MCDA or could be discussed qualitatively as part of wider nexus interconnections Conclusions and recommendations This paper has proposed a new method for quantifying environ mental impacts on the foodenergywaterhealth nexus The methodology is underpinned by life cycle thinking and uses LCA impacts to estimate the overall impact on the nexus The LCA impacts can be allocated to different aspects and aggregated using weighting factors based on stakeholder interests and preferences The method is generic and can be applied to any product process or human activity to assess its environmental sustainability within the nexus It also allows for exploration of the interconnections between different aspects of the nexus The methodology has been illustrated by considering the impacts on the nexus of recovering resources from food waste within the context of a circular economy The ndings show that anaerobic digestion has the lowest impacts on all four nexus aspects and the lowest overall nexus impact Anaerobic digestion primarily impacts the nexus through ammonia emissions from digestate which affects the food aspect through terrestrial acidication and the health aspect through particulate matter for mation Despite having a similar impact on the food aspect thenexus impact for incineration is times greater than that of anaerobic digestion Incineration has a marginally greater impact on health than landll due to the air pollution from ue gases However the overall nexus impact for landlling is more than double that of incineration Owing to high marine eutrophication related to the leachate landlling also has the high est impact on the water aspect Invessel composting is the worst option overall with the nexus impact times higher than anaerobic digestion It also has the highest impact on the food energy and health aspects as it is a net consumer of grid electricity The ranking of the options does not change by allocating the impacts to different nexus aspects Similarly changing the weight ing of the impacts has no effect on the ranking although the impacts on the individual nexus aspects change to a certain extentThe comparison of the results with those obtained via multi criteria decision analysis shows that the ranking outcomes are robust for the systems considered Therefore the methodology can be used to strengthen the nd ings of an LCA study or provide further insights into the environ mental sustainability of different systems that may not be evident from LCA impacts alone For example in this particular case consideration of the nexus and the interactions between its different aspects reinforced the LCA ndings that anaerobic diges tion is the best option and invessel composting the worst also showing that circular does not necessarily mean environmentally sustainable However depending on the systems considered the ndings of the LCA and the nexus methodology may not always be aligned in which case the latter can be used to provide deeper understanding of the interactions of different impacts within the nexus It is thus recommended that future work applies the methodology to other systems It may be possible to add other aspects to the four considered here such as waste and resources Broadening the methodology to include two other
