inevitable rise in human population resource recovery from waste stream is becoming important for a sustainable economy conservation of the ecosystem as well as for reducing the dependence on the nite natural resources In this regard a biobased circular economy considers organic wastes and residues as potential re sources that can be utilized to supply chemicals nutrients and fuels needed by mankind This review explored the role of aerobic and anaerobic digestion technologies for the advancement of a biobased circular society Thedeveloped routes within the anaerobic digestion domain such as the production of biogas and other highvaluechemicals volatile fatty acids were discussed The potential to recover important nutrients such as nitrogen through composting was also addressed An emphasis was made on the innovative models for improved eco nomics and process performance which include codigestion of various organic solid wastes recovery of multiple bioproducts and integrated bioprocesses Introduction Disposal of organic solid waste OSW has become one of the hot topics in research Simultaneously the collection and recycling of OSW is presently principal environmental concerns in both urban and countryside areas in numerous industrial and developing countries Vinay et al With the rapid development of modern society and the continuously rising population all over the world the generation ofOSW is projected to be signi cantly increased annually Statistically billion tons of municipal wastes were produced worldwide and by approximately billion tons of municipal wastes will be emerged annually if the current trend continues Luis et al Furthermore improper waste management is not only pernicious tohuman beings and local environment but also exacerbates the climate change and causes the sanitation system thus forcing nations and governments to invest more nancial and material resources for its remediation Consequently ideal technologies to OSW management isnot only conducive to environmental protection and sustainable development but also critical to forge a circular economy Felix et al In a circular economy recycling and reuse is the major principle for designing and optimization of products As nations and authorities allover the world gradually embracing the concept of circular economy and attempting to bring it in practice disposing wastes with an ad vanced and sustainable way could promote e cient economic growth with reduced environmental impacts at the same time Pooja et al GonzlezGarca et al This concept not only creates more job opportunities but also able to converts waste into treasure andtransforms it to a new clean energy and material sources through classied management and recycling Governments and municipalities around the world have started paying great attention to it and constantly reform the urban wastes management system making it an important part of the green economy and sustainable development Biswabandhu et al The majorities of OSW are composed of  Received November Received in revised form January Accepted January Corresponding author at College of Natural Resources and Environment Northwest AF University Yangling Shaanxi Province PR China Email address mukeshawasthiyahoocom MK AwasthiBioresource Technology Available online January Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Tanimal wastes municipal and agricultural wastes thus OSWs are gen erally rich in nutrient substances such as proteins minerals and su gars which can be reused as raw materials in the production of green energy Kiros et al Nevertheless due to the restrictions of the allocated budgets infrastructure development OSW management is still su ering from improper treatment in most developing and even in few developed countries Therefore the most decisive factors in OSWmanagement is to develop an economically sustainable process fol lowed by technically feasible socially and legally acceptable as well as environment friendly Hence OSW management is usually one of the most important challenges for the authorities and a hot research topic all over the world Alejandra et al Based on the characteristics of the OSW they are generally treated to be converted into organicfertilizer or directly transport to land ll sites or incineration facilities Therefore the conventional methods including land ll incineration and composting are traditional matured technologies for OSW man agement Di erent processing technologies possess varied advantages and also drawbacks as well On the other hand biological technologiesfor OSW treatment are nowadays seriously considered in the world because of the characteristics of low energy consumption low cost and investment high organic removal rate and meeting the requirement of circular economy Nurul et al However due to the di erent economical possibilities of various countries and the OSW treatmenttechnologies traditionally the most commonly applied technologies are still land ll in developing countries and incineration in most of the developed countries Composting and anaerobic digestion AD depend on the decom position and degradation of organic matter in OSW to stable substancessuch as humus and digestate could be applied to soil as a fertilizer orsoil improvement if their qualities are at standard level During the AD process biogas that is rich in methane and carbon dioxide are pro duced which could be used as a fuel for combustion in transport orenergy production Nuhaa Meanwhile though these two tech nologies are not new they probably could have a key role in achievingcircular economy objectives to divert OSW from land ll and incinera tion and improving the circularity of biological nutrients Howeverthere are still many practical and technical issues that need to be ad dressed in the application of these two biological treatment methods Zhang et al In Europe million tons of OSW could be po tentially recycled by AD and composting technologies Felix et al This would save about one million tons of nitrogen and million tons of organic carbon Luis et al At present most of these nutrients are lost through land lling organic waste The European Commission reported that the European countries in average recycleonly of the total OSW It is estimated that if a higher portion of OSWs could be recycled and reused it could replace approximately of the chemical fertilizer applied to soil that means million tons phosphate fertilizer every year Luis et al OSW can be converted to vary products through di erent processing technologies such as fertilizer heat clean fuel from AD plant and soil food from composting as well as methane from land ll Despite this either composting or AD must be fully understood prior to their widerdeployment This review comprehensively describes the current gen eration state of the OSW and di erent disposal technologies particu larly for composting and AD and elaborating on the details of theirtreatment process and their environmental social and economicTable Wastes production by economic and household activities until on percentage basis Countries Mining and quarrying Manufacturing Energy Construction and demolition Other economic activities Households EU Belgium Bulgaria Czechia Denmark Germany Estonia Ireland Greece Spain France Croatia Italy Cyprus Latvia Lithuania Luxemburg Hungary Malta Netherlands Austria Poland Portugal Romania Slovenia Slovakia Finland Sweden United Kingdom Iceland Liechtenstein Norway Montenegro North Macedonia Serbia Turkey Bosnia and Herzegovina Kosovo Source Eurostat online data code envwasgen S Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology applicability Both of these two technologies are not completely eco nomically feasible because of which they have not been successful applied in many countries A deep insight has been attempted in this paper to make a better understanding for the importance of its eco nomic viability Organic solid waste generation The constant increase of worldwide population to more than seven billion plus the continuous improvement of global welfare has resulted in a rapid increase of the daily consumption of resources and products thus tremendous amount of recyclable wastes is generated Alejandra et al The generation of wastes per capita in most of the industrial countries are higher than developing countries which is most likely connected to the socioeconomic status of the country Taking the EU as an example EU nations produced nearly million tons of wastes through all the activities including economic and households in Amongst it the speci c waste output of each EU nation also il lustrated that the total amount of wastes generated had a certain degreeof negligible relationship with the economic scale and population of a nation Forough et al It can be clearly observed from Table that the EU member states with the smallest population and area possessed the lowest waste generation oppositely the large nations owned the highest production However Italy had a relatively high amount of wastes generation while Bulgaria and Romania possessed relatively low level of waste It is reported that in urban and rural areas of EU and other Asia countries the level of solid wastes generation ranges from to and to kg per capita per day respectively while the urban areas generate approximately billion tons of solid wastes in It is estimated that it will increase to billion tons by WBA Generally the produced solid wastes are composed by agricultural and industrial wastes including leather wood glass paper green waste biomass household wastes and electronic wastes such as computers telephones refrigerators and televisions as well as also construction demolition wastes and medical wastes Munawar et al As mentioned above in most of the developing countries the massivepopulation growth and the acceleration of urbanization as well as the continuous improvement of people s living standards have signi cantly resulted in increasing the amount of urban wastes The population allover the world was about billion in and it will reach to billion by Biswabandhu et al The population in urban areas is prognosed to account for and of the total populationin developed and developing countries respectively Silva et al Meanwhile the dramatic increase of urban population will also result ininfrastructural and strategic challenges as well as adverse landuse changes Waste to energy technologies could turn as wise choices to deal with these circumstances and provide longterm and coste ective solutions for the growing energy requirements and sustainable wastemanagement It is estimated that only from the global urban waste collection market can produce around billion income Waste Management World However currently only a quarter of wastes are recycled Hence recycling and utilizing OSW by applying biotechnologies has great bright prospects and market in the near fu ture Kiros et al Current organic solid waste treatment technologies Various options are available for converting organic solid wastes into useful resources Although pure cultures are ideal or synthesizing chemicals at high speci city and thus requiring minimal puri cation prior to nal use they require single substrates in the form of eg su gars This has major drawbacks as it raises the cost of production and also competes for resources required for growing food and feed for humans and animals thus raising ethical debates Natural mixed bac terial consortia are therefore an attractive option for treating theabundantly available heterogeneous solid wastes and enables resourcerecovery in the form of energy and highvalue platform chemicals through anaerobic digestion These bacterial systems are also robust and have the capacity to withstand stressful microenvironments Among the biological solid waste treatment possibilities provided in this section only the production of biogas has been widely commer cialized The other products of ADs are mainly at research stage pro viding opportunities for further scienti c investigations and develop ment Wainaina et al a Biogas production AD is an established biological processing technique suitable for stabilizing a plethora of organic solid wastes coupled with recovery of energy and nutrients It provides a sustainable option for providing renewable materials and fuels thereby contributing to circular economy Antoniou et al Indeed there are indications of that the biogas industry is steadily growing due to apparent substantial reduction of thecapital and operating costs of AD facilities Indeed it has been esti mated that the cost of production of biogas in AD facilities would re duce by about in compared to Ecofys Globally it the estimated that biogas production had an average growth rate of reaching up to billion Nm in WBA The AD process takes place in oxygende cient environments and is catalyzed by natural microbial communities in a fourstage complex process resulting into mainly biogas A pretreatment step carried out either biologically chemically or physically can precede the actualbiodegradation process in order to adequately prepare substrates with dicult structures such as lignocelluloses Taherzadeh and Karimi Sarsaiya et al a The AD process kinetics are determined by the nature of substrates and the physicochemical parameters such as the pH temperature and hydraulic retention time Weiland The details of the reactions taking place during the breakdown of thesolid wastes during AD are provided in previous reviews Aryal et al Merlin Christy et al Weiland In summary in the rst stage hydrolytic microbes break down the complex macro molecules into simple monomers with the help of enzymes such asamylases lipases and proteases The second stage applies acidogenic microbes and converts the soluble products produced in the rst step into biomolecules such as alcohols volatile fatty acids VFAs hydrogen H and carbon dioxide CO These products then serve as substrates for acidogens for synthesis of mainly acetic acid in the thirdstage The nal stage is the most sensitive and greatly relies on the success of the previous reactions in which methanogens convert aceticacid hydrogen and carbon dioxide into biogas The methanogens follow mainly the acetotrophic aceticlastic and Wood Ljungdahl pathways for production of CH from acetic acid and the reaction be tween H and CO respectively with the latter being more common Aryal et al Merlin Christy et al Rusmanis et al The chemical composition of raw biogas from a typical solid waste AD facility is based on the process conditions It consists of CH CO N H O ppm HS ppm NH and other minor impurities Kapoor et al Yentekakis and Goula The raw biogas can be directlyapplied for generating electricity and heat while upgraded gas bio methane can be injected into the natural gas grid or used as vehicle fuel Fig The latter application has been reported to having the potential of aiding in reducing road transport related greenhouse gasGHG emissions by up to Olsson and Fallde In order to use the biogas as a transport fuel an extra treatment is required for removal of CO and other impurities such as H S and water vapor Gas cleaning is the initial step for removal of impurities that could damagemechanical and electrical appliances during the use of biogas and can be achieved using adsorption with silica gel and activated carbon or molecular sieves Upgrading techniques mainly for separation of CO from CH in order to raise the calori c value of the gas are waterS Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology scrubbing pressure swing adsorption cryogenic technology membrane separation and organic scrubbing using amines such as diethanolamine diglycolamine and monoethanolamine Kapoor et al Hydrogen production Energy recovery from solid wastes can also be achieved via the dark fermentation process Compared to the conventional production routessuch as steam reforming of methane and noncatalytic partial oxidation of fossil fuels production of hydrogen from wastes not only reduces the reliance on the depleting petroleum resources but at the same time it isless energyintensive as well Kapdan and Kargi Hydrogen has a higher heating value compared to methane vs MJkg Liu et al Its thus a potential clean energy source especially for the transport industry Its other areas of application include production ofelectronics processing of steel as well as hydrogenation of fats and oils Kapdan and Kargi A number of organic solid wastes that have been explored for hydrogen production are provided in Table The dark fermentation process is principally an intermediate within the AD process in which hydrogen is released Thus relevant parameters suitable for biosynthesis of hydrogen while at the same time deactivating the methanogens that would otherwise consume it are optimized Kapdan and Kargi Some of the important process parameters for ideal hydrogen production include the pH level temperature and bioreactor design Fang and Liu reported an op timal pH level of while mesophilic and thermophilic temperatureranges were found to stimulate hydrogen production from wastes compared to psychrophilic conditions Wang and Wan Wang and Wan Hydrogen fermentation systems also require appropriate bioreactor design to supply necessary hydrodynamic properties such as sucient mixing Ren et al It is worth mentioning that the presence of other byproducts such as volatile fatty acids VFAs atcertain concentrations can negatively impact on the microbial hydrogen production due to potential inhibition or even the depletion of hy drogen associated with formation of some VFAs Potential solutions such as the use of membrane bioreactors have been proposed as ef fective in removing the VFAs as they are being formed and thereby improving the gas production Trad et al Production of soluble biochemicals Volatile fatty acids VFAs are shortchain aliphatic carboxylic acids also formed as in termediaries during the AD process before the methanogenesis stageand consist between and carbon atoms Petroleum resources are currently utilized for industrial synthesis of VFAs and replacing these resources with solid wastes as the primary feedstock creates and at tractive circular economy pathway The success of the acidi cation in AD reactors depends on optimization of operating parameters such thepH temperature organic loading rate OLR and the hydraulic reten tion time HRT as well as employing appropriate means to deactivate the methanogenic VFAsconsumers Atasoy et al Lim et al Wainaina et al a Table gives the performance of some wastetoVFAs systems These acids have the potential for use as building blocks in a wide spectrum of industrial processes For instance acetic acid can be ap plied in pharmaceutical industries propionic acid for manufacture of paints butyric acid for manufacture of perfumes while caproic acid is used for preparation of food additives The mixed solution of these VFAs also has important applications in wastewater treatment plants for biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus biosynthesis of mixed alcohols as well as production of biodegradable plastics Moreover the VFAs can be applied to generate electricity in microbial fuels cells in addition to serving as the carbon source for bioprocessing of biodiesel GonzlezGarca et al In order to facilitate practical production systems recovery and puri cation of VFAs from fermentation broths are crucial This involves primary separation of the liquid VFA fraction from the solid contents inthe bioreactor made up of the cells and nutrients which might be sucient for some applications However for some application areas more complex fractionation is needed for attaining the strict purityrequirements Adsorption gas stripping and electrodialysis are ex amples of relevant methods proved to be e ective in separation of the VFAs in model carboxylate solutions Atasoy et al Some re searchers have also designed systems with the recovery procedurerunning concurrently with the actual microbial process in the socalled in situ product recovery using membraneaided techniques Arslan et al Wainaina et al b The bene ts of such schemes are the supply of the carboxylates for subsequent processing without introduction of foreign soluble chemicals in addition to the relief on the microbes from potential harmful e ects of undissociated acid mole cules Lactic acid Lactic acid is a carboxylate with a market potential of USD billion by used for production of acrylic acid biodegradable polymers pyruvic acid propanediol among others Bonk et al Phanthumchinda et al Its main area of application is as a building block for poly lactic acid which has a high estimated market value of USD billion by due to the mounting ecological concerns and supportive government policies Phanthumchinda et al A signi cant portion of the global industrial production is from fermentation which is controlled by factors such as pH temperature and nitrogen concentration Alves de Oliveira et al The lactic acid bacteria LAB are popular for processing single su gars into lactic acid In the AD systems a variety of organic residues such as food wastes and organic fraction of municipal solid waste can be processed using microbes such as Lactobacilli during the acidogenic phase Gu et al Probst et al Gu et al for instance achieved a lactic acid buildup of up to in a leach bed reactor treating food waste Another research by Bonk et al developed an AD reactor coupled with a percolation system which yielded lacticacid at g chemical oxygen demand equivalent per g total solids fed gCODgTS fed from food waste with lactic acid concentration of up to g CODL As with the VFAs appropriate product separation and puri cation methods are required to enhance the purity of lactic acid One of the possible e orts involved a membraneassisted lactic acid recovery method that incorporated micro ltration for cell removal ultraltration for protein removal and reverse osmosis for con centrating the lactic acid at high purity Phanthumchinda et al Fig Potential feed stock conversion technologies and productsS Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology Other potential biochemicals The AD process also synthesizes other useful metabolites although in low concentrations According to Zhou et al the possible metabolic pathways during the acidogenic biodegradation of wastes can lead to biosynthesis of other chemicals alongside VFAs lactic acid and hydrogen One such metabolite is succinic acid which can be ap plied in key industrial processes such as manufacture of inks polymers and pharmaceuticals and is biosynthesized via the tricarboxylic acid cycle TCA Isar et al The use of pure microbes such as Acti nobacillus succinogenes and an engineered Escherichia coli strain was found to e ectively convert food waste hydrolysate into succinic acidSun et al Concentrations of up to gL were detected during biodegradation of food waste at pH Lim et al Such a performance indicates the potential for mixed bacterial consortium for metabolizing succinate that could be investigated in future studies Ethanol has also been detected in small amounts from anaerobic di gestion digesters For instance acidi cation of food waste yielded low concentrations at pH and Xiong et al In another study Zhang et al found that ethanol made up of the liquid fraction during the thermophilic AD of glucose One proposal to raisethe concentration of ethanol by Zhou et al would be providing high H partial pressure in the head space of acidi cation reactorsTable Potential organic waste substrates and optimal conditions for hydrogen

Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology Nutrient recovery The anaerobic digestion AD is considered as one of the foremost costeective biological treatments of the biowaste It permits vitality recuperation and the generation of nutrientrich digestate whereas lessening natural impacts of the waste transfer It contains most of the supplements from the input material and can be utilized as fertilizer or organic amendment for farming The natural supplement circle locally the digestate that needs to be utilized in ranches found adjacent to the mAD microanaerobic digestion units Thiriet et al The bio waste is utilized to provide vitality and recover other nutrients not onlybecause it advances towards the nancial conditions of a country but besides makes a di erence towards nancial change of human society Bhatia et al Recognizably the two forms ie anaerobic di gestion and composting facilitates together since the solid fraction ofdigestate can be treated vigorously so as to recover both renewable energy and nutrients from common waste Micolucci et al These pro table nutrients display in natural strong waste which are eciently misplaced can be recovered through appropriate biochem ical technologies and utilized as nutrientrich fertilizers in rural areasfor keeping up soil richness and arrive rebuilding hones at lowinput premise In this way impressive emphasis is being focused on receiving biologically sound on best of nancially maintainable and socially ac ceptable tools which reinforce potential recuperation of nutrients withleast contamination

recoup as hydroxyapatiterich supplements Zhen et al Compostingcocomposting Composting process occurs naturally in the environment although ecient composting is needed to control several factors to avoid en vironmental challenges such as odor and dust and for obtaining aquality agricultural manure Generally composting process are divided into two phases the biooxidative phase and the maturing phase also named as curing phase Bernal et al The biooxidative phase again carried out in three stages such as initial activation thermophilicand mesophilic or maturation phase The organic waste degradation occurs during the thermophilic phase and microorganisms degrade the available compounds in the organic waste Keener et al In this phase high temperature generation in the composting pile observeddue to the heat generated from the composting pile due to the microbial degradation of organic waste Sarsaiya et al Generally high temperature is required ie C to destroy pathogens in the organicsolid waste and usually composting piles reach temperatures as high as C during the degradation of animal manure and green waste Singh and Kalamdhad Tang et al Cceres et al In ad dition in this stage the organic compounds degraded to CO and NH Jeong et al Kim et al with the uptake of O Finally when the exhaustion of decomposable organic fraction in the waste Fig Biogas production and the potential applicationsS Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology achieved the temperature starts decreasing in the composting pile and hence beginning of the maturation phase observed and stabilization and humication of the organic matter occur producing a mature compost with humic characteristics Ravindran and Sekaran Hence this compost can be characterized as the stable and sanitized product that make the composting for sustainable agriculture and resource man agement Haug Ravindran et al Gajalakshmi and Abbasi Over the last decades researchers have been focusing on the study of the complex interaction between physical chemical and biologicalfactors that takes place during natural composting under controlled conditions There are several factors a ecting the composting process such as nutrient balance pH porosity and moisture of the compostingmixture aeration moisture content and temperature Thus the control of these parameters such as porosity nutrient content CN ratio temperature pH moisture and oxygen supply have established to be key factors for optimization of composting process as they determine the optimal conditions for organic matter degradation and microbial growth Agnew and Leonard Das and Keener Haug Richard et al The e ectiveness of compost material with regard to their bene cial eects on agricultural as a nutrient source depends on the quality of the compost The quality criteria for compost materialare determined by their nutrient content organic matter stabilization presence of heavy metals and toxic compounds The traditional composting process results in partial decomposition which has phytotoxic e ects in the nal product Ravindran et al In order to overcome the conventional composting limitations several researchers have employed an invessel composting strategy for dierent types of waste such as y ash with organic waste Mandpe et al swine manure Awasthi et al a Yang et al Ravindran et al municipal solid waste Malinowski et al sewage sludge Jain et al An invessel composting system provides a controlled environment which eliminates some ofthe obstacles inherent in traditional composting systems for producing nutrient rich matured manure Despite that environmental concerns related to composting existed and can be categorized into three aspects described below Residual pollutants from contaminated feedstocks Due to the existing contaminants in the feedstock the levels of re sidual pollutants partly determined the feasibility of composting in eld utilization Such contaminants include heavy metals organic pollu tants and emerging contaminants Heavy metals refer to metallic chemical elements that had a higher density and cm Due to the high toxicity long persistence and biomagni cation traits heavy metal accumulation in soils have become a global issue Yang et al Feedstock for composting such as animal manure or sewage sludge generally contain a certain amount of heavy metals and these metals would be concentrated in the compost with the degradation of an organic compound although the bioavailability is reduced Li et al For example a nationwide survey on heavy metal content in compost derived from animals manures found the concentration of Zn Cu Cr Ni Pb As Co Cd and Hg ranged from to to to to to to to to and to mg kg respectively Yang et al There were even higher levels of heavy metals in other feed stock s like sewage sludge Awasthi et al Accordingly government across di erent countries have introduced strict standard to regulate the maximumpermissible values for organic compost Organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs such as polychlorinated biphenyl PCB pesticides and petroleum were generally found in compost Ren et al Houot et al Even though the concentrations of such pollutants were gen erally reduced through composting via biodegradation the concentra tion of residual organic pollutants might be higher than the background levels which means inputs of such compost should be limited Brandliet al The other residues pollutants are antibiotic resistance genes and emerging contaminants such as micro particle hormone and peruorinated compounds PFCs There were also high content of antibiotic in the common feedstock s of composting ie sludge and manures and studies focused on the fate of antibiotics and antibiotics resistance genes have become a research hotspot since Ezzariai et al However studies on the transformation of antibiotic re sistance genes are still limited and the obtained results are partly contracted with each other Wu et al Wang et al Therefore more detailed research on the fate of antibiotic residencegenes during composting should be further investigated Odors During composting series of stinky gases such as hydrogen sul de volatile organic sul des ammonia pyridine amines hydrocarbons terpenes alcohols ketones aldehydes and esters were generated Wei et al Additionally the constitution and concentration of dif ferent compounds varied signi cantly and a ected by the feed stock properties composting operation conditions and the ambient en vironment Awasthi et al Even though their concentrations are quite low emission of odors gases can lead to signi cant allergy among the neighbor Fortunately we can signi cantly reduce the emission of odors nowadays by mediating ingredient properties enhancing aeration providing catalysts and inoculant and building airtight com posting facilities More speci cally providing enzymatic catalysts on the surface of a compost pile or in the airspace above it can facilitate thebiological reaction and eventually degrade the odorous compounds Additionally the addition of straw materials chemical reagents such as FeCl lime and MgO and biochars can e ectively prevent the emission of odors during composting Ren et al Gonzlez et al Challenges and prospects of biobased circular economy The term biobased circular economy can refer to an approach that promotes the reuse and valorization of organic wastes and re sidues In the recent years it has more essential options for the con version of biowaste and their intermediate products into bioenergy or secondary raw materials Mohan et al Integrated organic solid waste treatments technologies Rapid urbanization is surely creating enormous pressure on the urban bodies to deal with the demands of the developing populace andthe consistently expanding huge amounts of waste all through the world Awasthi et al Zhou et al Zhao et al Because of lack of information and inappropriate waste gathering frameworks theuntreated waste eventually arrives at the land lls and are responsible of aggravating the natural conditions Inability in completely grasping allthe issues identi ed with the management of municipal solid waste MSW ends up being one of the most challenging issues of degradingthe environment MSW contains a signi cant portion of or ganics Bhattacharyya et al The amount of each waste stream within the total solid waste generated varies with changes in speci c parameters Arafat et al At present waste is viewed as an important asset rather than re cognizing it to be useless and resource extraction from them is one ofthe primary goals of sustainable waste management Kumar A few treatment technologies are feasible with varying waste management abilities Arafat et al However no single technique can x the issue of waste management Tehrani et al Therefore an integrated approach towards the treatment of solid waste is of greatimportance It not just gives an adaptable waste treatment decision organic or inorganic but energy and asset recovery can likewise be eectively accomplished through it Zhou et al The signi cant reason behind treating the organic waste is to recover recyclables andS Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology energy from it and furthermore to improve the quality of the waste handling it Fig Organic solid waste treatment technologies may incorporate either a combination of mechanical thermal or biological treatments or any ofthe three separately The signi cant ones being the thermal and bio logical treatment techniques Kumar An integrated approach is certainly required which should be from its generation to its nal dis posal The treatment procedure chosen ought to be such that it accomplishes the objectives of waste management When the waste is explicitly organic in nature the biological procedures plays the main job which are the aerobic and anaerobic digestion bioland lling bio drying and vermicomposting Aerobic digestion transforms the easilydegradable organic waste aerobically into soil conditioners and carbon dioxide with resulting heat production Polprasert Whereas anaerobic digestion involves degrading the organic waste anaerobicallywhich leads to recovery of energy in form of biogas Tchobanoglous et al In this process the organic waste gets decomposed by dierent microbial actions However in comparison to aerobic diges tion anaerobic digestion produces less solid sludge Henze et al Bioland lling is another procedure utilized for managing the solid waste that upgrades the waste degradation and also increases themeasure of biogas formation Davis and Cornwell Anaerobic processing and bioland lling varies just in the utilization of reactor type which is simply the land ll itself during bioland lling Bio drying is another such approach that aides in diminishing the measure of waterpresent in the natural waste which would some way or another hamper the energy recuperation process Polprasert It additionally helps in saving energy for usage in residue derived fuels Adani et al All the major integrated organic waste treatment technologies discussed above have been shown in Fig All these technologies re quire a legitimate identi cation and assessment of accessible options planning collection isolation treatment and nal disposal In addition understanding the potential interrelationships between various treat ment options would help in building up an integrated approach where all the individual techniques supplement one another Technoeconomic feasibility of aerobic and anaerobic digestiontechnologies Wastes from one industrial process can serve as the raw materials for another thereby reducing the impact of industry in the environ ment was described by Frosch and Gallopoulos Ecoindustrial parks are making collaborate with other intercompany to optimize theresource e ciency They can share the resources water and energy Whereas working together the community of businesses looking forcollective bene ts rather than individual bene ts Hence the ecoin dustrial parks make industrial symbiosis for improvement of theireconomic status by sharing the raw materials and wastes An anaerobic digestion process is a process that can biochemically modify the whole biomass into speci c components and this process can produce carbon dioxide phosphorus and ammonia to improve the economic and environmental bene ts The biochemical processes in anaerobic digestion are nature It is accepted and established as an innovative technology toproduce the bio energy from whole biomass Kavitha et al Stiles et al An assessment of technoeconomic analysis and life cycle are es sential for any processes to be sustainable which can be analysis bythree parameters like economical viability technical feasibility and environmental sustainability There are number of industries and in vestors looking the production of biogas using anaerobic digestion method for generation of energy and a highrisk investment because of its process like feedstock supply segregation of solid waste char acteristics features of feedstock pro t issues and optional problems Schmidt Based on the above facts the many governments have support and encourage by provide the funds to company for this area According to Waste Management World the global biogas market will reach billion on hence it is crucial for scientistand researchers to conduct their research on anaerobic digestion at systems level as well as technoeconomic and environmental bene ts perspective So it is very essential to assess integrated analyses ofeconomic viability and technical feasibility on anaerobic digestiontechnologies The economic analysis for particular process is analyzed by values of materials for construction interest rate and labor cost Murthy The technoeconomic analysis and life cycle Fig Schematic presentation of integrated food waste and wastewater treatment method MOWFAST and conventional sludge PSSS treatment by anaerobic digestion Extracted from Kaur et al S Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology assessment LCA are providing the insights on the feasibility of a process and it is very important for bioenergy and biobased products Murthy Technoeconomic evaluation determines that max imum funds spent in biogas puri cation for various applications in cluding the powertogas electricity and vehicle fuel Various anaerobic digester upgrading methods are available with membrane separation water scrubbing pressure adsorption and solvent scrubbing Hence the government has high cost for upgrading the anaerobic systems Bauer et al International Energy Agency Anaerobic codigestion process is gradually more used to change the liquid and solid waste into nutrient rich content and reduce the impactof noxious compounds in the process and enhance the yield of biogas Carlini et al It is considered as the most important method for the management of biomass

gases Torquati et al Weiland United Kingdome and Hong Kong have strongwilled to sponsor the use anaerobic digestion methods for energy production and recovery It also ful ls the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs for development of renewable energy HK Policy address In Italy there are of biogas plants that produce MW electricity which straight relate to government incentives Gestore

facility for pro duction of biogas and upgrading the bioenergy for various appli cations as electricity and liquid methane for household cooking There is of budget allotted to collect and transport the waste by manual collection or truckstrailers in the sector of municipalities andcorporations Daniel and Perinaz In Ireland cost of month was spent to waste collection from various sectors like houses and industries for anaerobic digestion Koushki et al Fig shows the cost associated with complete value chain of anaerobicdigestion for solid waste Proposed models for a circular economy Codigestion Biodegradation of more than one type of waste in one anaerobic bioreactor albeit in appropriate proportions is a promising technique for increasing product yields ascribed to the balance of nutrients that enhances microbial performance coupled with the economic bene ts of treating a variety of materials in a single facility Abad et al Awasthi et al b PagsDaz et al Several researchers have observed improvement of AD systems from a number of solid wastesdemonstrating that anaerobic codigestion illustrated in Fig a could be a favorable method for achieving circular economy A study by Panichnumsin et al reported that an increase of in the speci c methane yield would be realized when a cassava pulppig manure mixture was applied in the ratio of relative to the use of pig manure alone The potential cause of the improved perfor mance was the improved process stability as well as an increase in the amounts of easily degradable macromolecules Panichnumsin et al In another study improved bu ering capacity and suitable carbontonitrogen ratio were found to facilitate a stable AD process at high organic load even without regulation of pH when food waste and cattle manure were in ratio of leading to an increase in the methane production by compared to food waste alone Zhang et al The codigestion strategy is also bene cial when targeting other AD bioproducts such as H and VFAs A research by Zhou et al b examined several mixtures containing food waste primary sludge andwaste activated sludge and concluded that codigestion of the substrates improved hydrogen production compared to single substrates The optimal increase was realized when a food wasteprimary sludgewaste activated sludge mixture was applied at a ratio Zhou et al b The impact of codigesting waste activated sludge and corn straw was investigated by Zhou et al a They observed an im provement in the maximum VFAs yield reaching up to when a Fig Various costs associated with the value chain of waste treatment from collection to products generation Extracted from Rajendran and Murthy S Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology ratio of of the mentioned substances was used compared to sludge only in addition to the manipulation of the product pro le Further results indicated that protein and carbohydrate consumption were enhanced by more than and respectively Zhou et al a Besides the conventional wet digestion solid wastes can also be biodegraded at high total solids content of between and in thesocalled dry AD processes using eg horizontal plug ow sequential batch textilebased and vertical plug ow reactors Dry AD is a pro mising technology for regions with low water availability and might also evade the pretreatment step for recalcitrant materials in addition to requiring more compact bioreactors Awasthi et al a An in crease in methane yield of was achieved when citrus wasteschicken feather and wheat straw at a ratio of in dry batch AD assays compared to single substrates When the same substrate ratio was used in a continous plug ow bioreactor a yield of NmLCH gVS added at a loading rate of gVSLd was obtained Patinvoh et al Another dry AD process was demonstrated by CapsonTojo et al in which food waste and cardboard were codigested in batch mode Their research focused on the impact inoculumtosubstrate ratio which was found to have a signi cant in uence on the methane yield microbial dynamics as well as the productions of hydrogen and VFAs Recovery of multiple products The AD process can be employed for the recovery of more than a single metabolite at reasonable yields thereby increasing the process conversion e ciency Fig b One of the possible scenarios was re cently successfully executed involving the production of both VFAs andbiogas from urban biowastes organic fraction of municipal solid waste and waste activated sludge in a pilot twostage AD process Valentino et al The acidi cation reactor in the rst stage operated at C generated VFAs up to at g CODL without external pHcontrol In the second stage the solidrich fraction collected from the acidication reactor was converted into biogas containing CH at a yield of up to mkg VS at C Furthermore it was claimed that a similar scaledup system at the mentioned temperature would be thermally sustainable leading to a surplus of thermal energy in additionto an estimated revenue stream of year from electricity Valentino et al Another scenario would involve the copro duction of lactic acid and methane Using organic fraction of municipal solid waste Dreschke et al designed a process to produce lactic acid in batch reactors at C Lactic acid made up to of the acidcontent with a yield of up to gkg was reached after h They alsoreported Lactobacilli enrichment in the microbial consortium The euent from the batch fermenters were then codigested with digested municipal sludge and a methane yield of up to NmL CH gVS was attained In addition the nal euent was proposed as a potential source of organic fertilizer Dreschke et al In addition to the production of dissolved metabolites it has been demonstrated the AD process can be applied for biosynthesis of both hydrogen and methane The system can be optimized to yield the se parate products in two distinct stages to produce a mixture known as hythane which usually contains hydrogen in methane Liu et al Wang et al In addition to the possibility of e ec tively optimizing the separate processes the other advantages of hy thane production relative to the single hydrogen or methane produc tion include the reduced overall fermentation time and the enhanced energy recovery Liu et al For instance Siddiqui et al observed that a single phase AD reactor resulted in mkgVS de stroyed methane yield while a twophase process produced m kgVS destroyed methane in addition to hydrogen at a yield of m kgVS destroyed Elsewhere when pulp and paper sludge and food waste on a mixing ratio based on the VS were used Lin et al demonstrated a twostage process in which hydrogen was produced inmesophilic conditions in stage one while the digestate from this stage was subjected to thermophilic AD conversion They reported no accu mulation of VFAs in the rst reactor that yielded hydrogen up to mLgVS fedat pH levels while the methane yield was mLgVS fedat pH levels in the second reactor In another research Wang et al codigested cassava stillage and excess sludge in thermophilic conditions and found a higher energy yield when a twophase fermentation system was carried instead of a one phase system By mixing cassava stillage and excess sludge at ratio of Fig Proposed models for circular economy using anaerobic digestion technology codigestion using municipal industrial and agricultural wastes a recovery of multiple products b and integration of bioprocesses cS Wainaina et al Bioresource Technology on VS basis a hydrogen yield of mLgVS fedand a methane yield of mLgVS fedwere attained Combined bioprocesses Another strategy to implement systems that potentially meets the circular economy criteria involves combination of processes that are independently optimized to recover renewable energy chemicals and materials Fig c Successful demonstrations of such schemes mainly comprise established industrial processes involving the production ofethanol from lignocellulosic materials as the major activity For in stance wheat straw was converted into three important products ethanol hydrogen and biogas Kaparaju et al The integrated bioprocess began with hydrothermal pretreatment of the wheat strawwhich resulted into celluloserich solid fraction and a hemicellulose rich liquid fraction The solid fraction was applied for ethanol fer mentation in which a yield of up to ggglucose was realized Biogas was then produced using the e uent from the ethanol produc tion processes yielding up to m CHkg VS added The liquid fraction from the straw pretreatment was separately used in dark fer mentation reactors and yielded up to mL H gsugars Similarly the euent from the hydrogen production processes was anaerobically digested to produce biogas at a yield of up to mCHkg VS added Woody biomass has also been applied as a feedstock for production ofboth ethanol and biogas Safari et al during an investigation on the performance of dilute H SOpretreatment of softwood pine de monstrated the potential improvements in the ethanol and biogas productions Similar to the previously described work the solid fraction from the pretreatment consisting mostly of cellulose was applied to produce ethanol production while the liquid fraction consisting of su gars was applied to produce biogas The authors reported the highest ethanol yield of while the highest biogas production yield was m methaneton of pinewood Another key outcome from their experiments showed that the inhibitory compounds released at thepretreatments at C had more negative impact on the production of biogas compared to the production of ethanol Safari et al Another study was made by Wachendorf et al proposed the use of silage for production of biogas and processing of a solid fuel as a potential feed stock for combustion or gasi cation The silage was rst subjected to hydrothermal conditioning and then mechanically dehydrated to separate the liquid from the solid portions The former portion was used as substrate for production of biogas while the latter portion remained as a press cake solid fuel Moreover the digestate from the anaerobic digester could be used as fertilizer for growing more silage making the proposed scheme highly e cient in resource recovery Wachendorf et al In addition a promising model that could be appropriate for agricultural wastes would be the simultaneous recovery of essential materials such as edible fungi Nair et al demon strated an integrated bioprocess in which biogas ethanol and proteinrich fungal biomass from pretreated wheat straw Neurospora intermedia was the species applied for producing ethanol yielding up to ofthe theoretical maximum as well as the biomass Further results re vealed that compared to untreated straw an increase of up to in the methane yield would be realized from the anaerobic treatment of the liquid stream from the pretreatment process Besides codigestion assays of the mentioned stream with thin stillage a waste stream from the ethanol production process resulted in an increase in the total energy output of up to Nair et al Conclusion This review paper evaluated resource recovery and circular economy options from organic solid waste using aerobic and anaerobic digestion technologies Utilization of organic waste residues would elevate biore nery concept and social acknowledgments Aerobic and anaerobic digestion are widely acceptable technologies to enhance theeciency for energy and other high value biobased productsproduction Overall various advanced models have recently been proposed and already worked out in line with a holistic biore nery avenue that bring enormous industrial importance Hence the technoeconomicexamination of these technologies is critically needed CRediT authorship contribution statement
